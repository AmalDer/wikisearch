'''Protein engineering''' is the process of developing useful or valuable [[protein]]s. It is a young discipline, with much research taking place into the understanding of [[protein folding]] and recognition for [[protein design]] principles. It has been used to improve the function of many enzymes for industrial catalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Woodley |first=John M. |date=May 2022 |title=Integrating protein engineering into biocatalytic process scale-up |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589597422000697 |journal=Trends in Chemistry |language=en |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=371–373 |doi=10.1016/j.trechm.2022.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a product and services market, with an estimated value of $168 billion by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Speeding Up the Protein Assembly Line |url=https://www.genengnews.com/magazine/239/speeding-up-the-protein-assembly-line/5418/ |work=Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News |date=13 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two general strategies for protein engineering: [[protein design|rational protein design]] and [[directed evolution]].  These methods are not mutually exclusive; researchers will often apply both.  In the future, more detailed knowledge of [[protein structure]] and [[Protein function|function]], and advances in [[high-throughput screening]], may greatly expand the abilities of protein engineering.  Eventually, even unnatural amino acids may be included, via newer methods, such as [[expanded genetic code]], that allow encoding novel amino acids in genetic code.

==Approaches==

=== Rational design ===
{{main|Protein design}}
In rational protein design, a scientist uses detailed knowledge of the structure and function of a protein to make desired changes. In general, this has the advantage of being inexpensive and technically easy, since [[site-directed mutagenesis]] methods are well-developed. However, its major drawback is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable, and, even when available, it can be very difficult to predict the effects of various mutations since structural information most often provide a static picture of a protein structure. However, programs such as [[Folding@home]] and [[Foldit]] have utilized [[crowdsourcing]] techniques in order to gain insight into the folding motifs of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farmer |first1=Tylar Seiya |last2=Bohse |first2=Patrick |last3=Kerr |first3=Dianne |title=Rational Design Protein Engineering Through Crowdsourcing |journal=Journal of Student Research |date=2017 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=31–38 |doi=10.47611/jsr.v6i2.377 |s2cid=57679002 |url=https://www.jofsr.org/index.php/path/article/view/377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Computational protein design [[algorithm]]s seek to identify novel amino acid sequences that are low in energy when folded to the pre-specified target structure. While the sequence-conformation space that needs to be searched is large, the most challenging requirement for computational protein design is a fast, yet accurate, energy function that can distinguish optimal sequences from similar suboptimal ones.

===Multiple sequence alignment===
Without structural information about a protein, sequence analysis is often useful in elucidating information about the protein. These techniques involve alignment of target protein sequences with other related protein sequences. This alignment can show which amino acids are conserved between species and are important for the function of the protein. These analyses can help to identify hot spot amino acids that can serve as the target sites for mutations. [[Multiple sequence alignment]] utilizes data bases such as PREFAB, SABMARK, OXBENCH, IRMBASE, and BALIBASE in order to cross reference target protein sequences with known sequences. Multiple sequence alignment techniques are listed below.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poluri|first1=Krishna Mohan|last2=Gulati|first2=Khushboo|title=Protein Engineering Techniques|date=2017|publisher=Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-2732-1|series=SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology|isbn=978-981-10-2731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

This method begins by performing pair wise alignment of sequences using [[k-tuple]] or [[Needleman–Wunsch algorithm|Needleman–Wunsch]] methods. These methods calculate a matrix that depicts the pair wise similarity among the sequence pairs. Similarity scores are then transformed into distance scores that are used to produce a guide tree using the neighbor joining method. This guide tree is then employed to yield a multiple sequence alignment.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Clustal omega====
This method is capable of aligning up to 190,000 sequences by utilizing the k-tuple method. Next sequences are clustered using the mBed and [[k-means clustering|''k''-means]] methods. A guide tree is then constructed using the [[UPGMA]] method that is used by the HH align package. This guide tree is used to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====MAFFT====
This method utilizes fast Fourier transform (FFT) that converts amino acid sequences into a sequence composed of volume and polarity values for each amino acid residue. This new sequence is used to find homologous regions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====K-Align====
This method utilizes the Wu-Manber approximate string matching algorithm to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Multiple sequence comparison by log expectation (MUSCLE)====
This method utilizes Kmer and Kimura distances to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====T-Coffee====
This method utilizes tree based consistency objective functions for alignment evolution. This method has been shown to be 5-10% more accurate than Clustal W.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Coevolutionary analysis===
Coevolutionary analysis is also known as correlated mutation, covariation, or co-substitution. This type of rational design involves reciprocal evolutionary changes at evolutionarily interacting loci. Generally this method begins with the generation of a curated multiple sequence alignments for the target sequence. This alignment is then subjected to manual refinement that involves removal of highly gapped sequences, as well as sequences with low sequence identity. This step increases the quality of the alignment. Next, the manually processed alignment is utilized for further coevolutionary measurements using distinct correlated mutation algorithms. These algorithms result in a coevolution scoring matrix. This matrix is filtered by applying various significance tests to extract significant coevolution values and wipe out background noise. Coevolutionary measurements are further evaluated to assess their performance and stringency. Finally, the results from this coevolutionary analysis are validated experimentally.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Structural prediction===
''De novo'' synthesis of protein benefits from knowledge of existing protein structures. This knowledge of existing protein structure assists with the prediction of new protein structures. Methods for protein structure prediction fall under one of the four following classes:  ''ab initio,'' fragment based methods, homology modeling, and protein threading.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====''Ab initio''====
These methods involve free modeling without using any structural information about the template. ''Ab initio'' methods are aimed at prediction of the native structures of proteins corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy. some examples of ''ab initio'' methods are AMBER, GROMOS, GROMACS, CHARMM, OPLS, and ENCEPP12. General steps for  ''ab initio'' methods begin with the geometric representation of the protein of interest. Next, a potential energy function model for the protein is developed. This model can be created using either molecular mechanics potentials or protein structure derived potential functions. Following the development of a potential model, energy search techniques including molecular dynamic simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and genetic algorithms are applied to the protein.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Fragment based====
These methods use database information regarding structures to match homologous structures to the created protein sequences. These homologous structures are assembled to give compact structures using scoring and optimization procedures, with the goal of achieving the lowest potential energy score. Webservers for fragment information are I-TASSER, ROSETTA, ROSETTA @ home, FRAGFOLD, CABS fold, PROFESY, CREF, QUARK, UNDERTAKER, HMM, and ANGLOR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|72}}

====Homology modeling====
These methods are based upon the homology of proteins. These methods are also known as comparative modeling. The first step in homology modeling is generally the identification of template sequences of known structure which are homologous to the query sequence. Next the query sequence is aligned to the template sequence. Following the alignment, the structurally conserved regions are modeled using the template structure. This is followed by the modeling of side chains and loops that are distinct from the template. Finally the modeled structure undergoes refinement and assessment of quality. Servers that are available for homology modeling data are listed here: SWISS MODEL, MODELLER, ReformAlign, PyMOD, TIP-STRUCTFAST, COMPASS, 3d-PSSM, SAMT02, SAMT99, HHPRED, FAGUE, 3D-JIGSAW, META-PP, ROSETTA, and I-TASSER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Protein threading====
Protein threading can be used when a reliable homologue for the query sequence cannot be found. This method begins by obtaining a query sequence and a library of template structures. Next, the query sequence is threaded over known template structures. These candidate models are scored using scoring functions. These are scored based upon potential energy models of both query and template sequence. The match with the lowest potential energy model is then selected. Methods and servers for retrieving threading data and performing calculations are listed here: GenTHREADER, pGenTHREADER, pDomTHREADER, ORFEUS, PROSPECT, BioShell-Threading, FFASO3, RaptorX, HHPred, LOOPP server, Sparks-X, SEGMER, THREADER2, ESYPRED3D, LIBRA, TOPITS, RAPTOR, COTH, MUSTER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Multivalent binding ===
{{Main|Polyvalency (chemistry)}}
Multivalent binding can be used to increase the binding specificity and affinity through [[avidity]] effects. Having multiple binding domains in a single biomolecule or complex increases the likelihood of other interactions to occur via individual binding events. Avidity or effective affinity can be much higher than the sum of the individual affinities providing a cost and time-effective tool for targeted binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Liu|first1=Cassie J.|title=Engineering Multivalent and Multispecific Protein Therapeutics|date=2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4372-7_14|work=Engineering in Translational Medicine|pages=365–396|editor-last=Cai|editor-first=Weibo|place=London|publisher=Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-4372-7_14|isbn=978-1-4471-4372-7|access-date=2021-12-08|author2-link=Jennifer Cochran|last2=Cochran|first2=Jennifer R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Multivalent proteins ====
Multivalent proteins are relatively easy to produce by post-translational modifications or multiplying the protein-coding DNA sequence. The main advantage of multivalent and multispecific proteins is that they can increase the effective affinity for a target of a known protein. In the case of an inhomogeneous target using a combination of proteins resulting in multispecific binding can increase specificity, which has high applicability in protein therapeutics.

The most common example for multivalent binding are the antibodies, and there is extensive research for bispecific antibodies. Applications of bispecific antibodies cover a broad spectrum that includes diagnosis, imaging, prophylaxis, and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Holliger|first1=P.|last2=Prospero|first2=T.|last3=Winter|first3=G.|date=1993-07-15|title="Diabodies": small bivalent and bispecific antibody fragments.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=90|issue=14|pages=6444–6448|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.14.6444|issn=0027-8424|pmc=46948|pmid=8341653|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.6444H |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brinkmann|first1=Ulrich|last2=Kontermann|first2=Roland E.|date=2017-02-17|title=The making of bispecific antibodies|journal=mAbs|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=182–212|doi=10.1080/19420862.2016.1268307|issn=1942-0862|pmc=5297537|pmid=28071970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directed evolution ===
{{main|Directed evolution}}
In directed evolution, random [[mutagenesis]], e.g. by [[error-prone PCR]] or [[sequence saturation mutagenesis]], is applied to a protein, and a selection regime is used to select variants having desired traits.  Further rounds of mutation and selection are then applied.  This method mimics natural [[evolution]] and, in general, produces superior results to rational design. An added process, termed [[DNA shuffling]], mixes and matches pieces of successful variants to produce better results.  Such processes mimic the [[homologous recombination|recombination]] that occurs naturally during [[sexual reproduction]].  Advantages of directed evolution are that it requires no prior structural knowledge of a protein, nor is it necessary to be able to predict what effect a given mutation will have.  Indeed, the results of directed evolution experiments are often surprising in that desired changes are often caused by mutations that were not expected to have some effect.  The drawback is that they require [[high-throughput screening]], which is not feasible for all proteins.  Large amounts of [[recombinant DNA]] must be mutated and the products screened for desired traits.  The large number of variants often requires expensive robotic equipment to automate the process.  Further, not all desired activities can be screened for easily.

Natural Darwinian evolution can be effectively imitated in the lab toward tailoring protein properties for diverse applications, including catalysis. Many experimental technologies exist to produce large and diverse protein libraries and for screening or selecting folded, functional variants. Folded proteins arise surprisingly frequently in random sequence space, an occurrence exploitable in evolving selective binders and catalysts. While more conservative than direct selection from deep sequence space, redesign of existing proteins by random mutagenesis and selection/screening is a particularly robust method for optimizing or altering extant properties. It also represents an excellent starting point for achieving more ambitious engineering goals. Allying experimental evolution with modern computational methods is likely the broadest, most fruitful strategy for generating functional macromolecules unknown to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jäckel |first1=Christian |last2=Kast |first2=Peter |last3=Hilvert |first3=Donald |title=Protein Design by Directed Evolution |journal=Annual Review of Biophysics |date=June 2008 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=153–173 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 |pmid=18573077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenges of designing high quality mutant libraries have shown significant progress in the recent past. This progress has been in the form of better descriptions of the effects  of mutational loads on protein traits. Also computational approaches have showed large advances in the innumerably large sequence space to more manageable screenable sizes, thus creating smart libraries of mutants. Library size has also been reduced to more screenable sizes by the identification of key beneficial residues using algorithms for systematic recombination. Finally a significant step forward toward efficient reengineering of enzymes has been made with the development of more accurate statistical models and algorithms quantifying and predicting coupled mutational effects on protein functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shivange|first1=Amol V|last2=Marienhagen|first2=Jan|last3=Mundhada|first3=Hemanshu|last4=Schenk|first4=Alexander|last5=Schwaneberg|first5=Ulrich|title=Advances in generating functional diversity for directed protein evolution|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.01.019|pmid=19261539|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, directed evolution may be summarized as an iterative two step process which involves generation of protein mutant libraries, and high throughput screening processes to select for variants with improved traits. This technique does not require prior knowledge of the protein structure and function relationship. Directed evolution utilizes random or focused mutagenesis to generate libraries of mutant proteins. Random mutations can be introduced using either error prone PCR, or site saturation mutagenesis. Mutants may also be generated using recombination of multiple homologous genes. Nature has evolved a limited number of beneficial sequences. Directed evolution makes it possible to identify undiscovered protein sequences which have novel functions. This ability is contingent on the proteins ability to tolerant amino acid residue substitutions without compromising folding or stability.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Directed evolution methods can be broadly categorized into two strategies, asexual and sexual methods.

=== Asexual methods ===
Asexual methods do not generate any cross links between parental genes. Single genes are used to create mutant libraries using various mutagenic techniques. These asexual methods can produce either random or focused mutagenesis.

==== Random mutagenesis ====
Random mutagenic methods produce mutations at random throughout the gene of interest. Random mutagenesis can introduce the following types of mutations: transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions, inversion, missense, and nonsense. Examples of methods for producing random mutagenesis are below.

====Error prone PCR====
Error prone PCR utilizes the fact that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001-0.002% per nucleotide per replication. This method begins with choosing the gene, or the area within a gene, one wishes to mutate. Next, the extent of error required is calculated based upon the type and extent of activity one wishes to generate. This extent of error determines the error prone PCR strategy to be employed. Following PCR, the genes are cloned into a plasmid and introduced to competent cell systems. These cells are then screened for desired traits. Plasmids are then isolated for colonies which show improved traits, and are then used as templates the next round of mutagenesis. Error prone PCR shows biases for certain mutations relative to others. Such as biases for transitions over transversions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Rates of error in PCR can be increased in the following ways:&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}
# Increase concentration of magnesium chloride, which stabilizes non complementary base pairing.
# Add manganese chloride to reduce base pair specificity. 
# Increased and unbalanced addition of dNTPs.
# Addition of base analogs like dITP, 8 oxo-dGTP, and dPTP.
# Increase concentration of Taq polymerase.
# Increase extension time.
# Increase cycle time.
# Use less accurate Taq polymerase.
Also see [[polymerase chain reaction]] for more information.

====Rolling circle error-prone PCR====
This PCR method is based upon rolling circle amplification, which is modeled from the method that bacteria use to amplify circular DNA. This method results in linear  DNA duplexes. These fragments contain tandem repeats of circular DNA called concatamers, which can be transformed into bacterial strains. Mutations are introduced by first cloning the target sequence into an appropriate plasmid. Next, the amplification process begins using random hexamer primers and Φ29  DNA polymerase under error prone rolling circle amplification conditions. Additional conditions to produce error prone rolling circle amplification are 1.5 pM of template DNA, 1.5 mM MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a 24 hour reaction time. MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is added into the reaction mixture to promote random point mutations in the DNA strands. Mutation rates can be increased by increasing the concentration of MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or by decreasing concentration of the template DNA. Error prone rolling circle amplification is advantageous relative to error prone PCR because of its use of universal random hexamer primers, rather than specific primers. Also the reaction products of this amplification do not need to be treated with ligases or endonucleases. This reaction is isothermal.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Chemical mutagenesis====
Chemical mutagenesis involves the use of chemical agents to introduce mutations into genetic sequences. Examples of chemical mutagens follow.

Sodium bisulfate is effective at mutating G/C rich genomic sequences. This is because sodium bisulfate catalyses deamination of unmethylated cytosine to uracil.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Ethyl methane sulfonate alkylates guanidine residues. This alteration causes errors during DNA replication.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Nitrous acid causes transversion by de-amination of adenine and cytosine.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

The dual approach to random chemical mutagenesis is an iterative two step process. First it involves the ''in vivo'' chemical mutagenesis of the gene of interest via EMS. Next, the treated gene is isolated and cloning into an untreated expression vector in order to prevent mutations in the plasmid backbone.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This technique preserves the plasmids genetic properties.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Targeting glycosylases to embedded arrays for mutagenesis (TaGTEAM)====
This method has been used to create targeted  ''in vivo'' mutagenesis in yeast. This method involves the fusion of a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase to tetR DNA-binding domain. This has been shown to increase mutation rates by over 800 time in regions of the genome containing tetO sites.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenesis by random insertion and deletion====
This method involves alteration in length of the sequence via simultaneous deletion and insertion of chunks of bases of arbitrary length. This method has been shown to produce proteins with new functionalities via introduction of new restriction sites, specific codons, four base codons for non-natural amino acids.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Transposon based random mutagenesis====
Recently many methods for transposon based random mutagenesis have been reported. This methods include, but are not limited to the following: PERMUTE-random circular permutation, random protein truncation, random nucleotide triplet substitution, random domain/tag/multiple amino acid insertion, codon scanning mutagenesis, and multicodon scanning mutagenesis. These aforementioned techniques all require the design of mini-Mu transposons. Thermo scientific manufactures kits for the design of these transposons.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random mutagenesis methods altering the target DNA length====
These methods involve altering gene length via insertion and deletion mutations. An example is the tandem repeat insertion (TRINS) method. This technique results in the generation of tandem repeats of random fragments of the target gene via rolling circle amplification and concurrent incorporation of these repeats into the target gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutator strains====
Mutator strains are bacterial cell lines which are deficient in one or more DNA repair mechanisms. An example of a mutator strand is the E. coli XL1-RED.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This subordinate strain of E. coli is deficient in the MutS, MutD, MutT DNA repair pathways. Use of mutator strains is useful at introducing many types of mutation; however, these strains show progressive sickness of culture because of the accumulation of mutations in the strains own genome.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== Focused mutagenesis ====
Focused mutagenic methods produce mutations at predetermined amino acid residues. These techniques require and understanding of the sequence-function relationship for the protein of interest. Understanding of this relationship allows for the identification of residues which are important in stability, stereoselectivity, and catalytic efficiency.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} Examples of methods that produce focused mutagenesis are below.

====Site saturation mutagenesis====
Site saturation mutagenesis is a PCR based method used to target amino acids with significant roles in protein function. The two most common techniques for performing this are whole plasmid single PCR, and overlap extension PCR.

Whole plasmid single PCR is also referred to as site directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM products are subjected to Dpn endonuclease digestion. This digestion results in cleavage of only the parental strand, because the parental strand contains a GmATC which is methylated at N6 of adenine. SDM does not work well for large plasmids of over ten kilobases. Also, this method is only capable of replacing two nucleotides at a time.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Overlap extension PCR requires the use of two pairs of primers. One primer in each set contains a mutation. A first round of PCR using these primer sets is performed and two double stranded DNA duplexes are formed. A second round of PCR is then performed in which these duplexes are denatured and annealed with the primer sets again to produce heteroduplexes, in which each strand has a mutation. Any gaps in these newly formed heteroduplexes are filled with DNA polymerases and further amplified.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence saturation mutagenesis (SeSaM)====
[[Sequence saturation mutagenesis]] results in the randomization of the target sequence at every nucleotide position. This method begins with the generation of variable length DNA fragments tailed with universal bases via the use of template transferases at the 3' termini. Next, these fragments are extended to full length using a single stranded template. The universal bases are replaced with a random standard base, causing mutations. There are several modified versions of this method such as SeSAM-Tv-II, SeSAM-Tv+, and SeSAM-III.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Single primer reactions in parallel (SPRINP)====
This site saturation mutagenesis method involves two separate PCR reaction. The first of which uses only forward primers, while the second reaction uses only reverse primers. This avoids the formation of primer dimer formation.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mega primed and ligase free focused mutagenesis====
This site saturation mutagenic technique begins with one mutagenic oligonucleotide and one universal flanking primer. These two reactants are used for an initial PCR cycle. Products from this first PCR cycle are used as mega primers for the next PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Ω-PCR====
This site saturation mutagenic method is based on overlap extension PCR. It is used to introduce mutations at any site in a circular plasmid.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====PFunkel-ominchange-OSCARR====
This method utilizes user defined site directed mutagenesis at single or multiple sites simultaneously. OSCARR is an acronym for ''one pot simple methodology for cassette randomization and recombination''. This randomization and recombination results in randomization of desired fragments of a protein. Omnichange is a sequence independent, multisite saturation mutagenesis which can saturate up to five independent codons on a gene.

====Trimer-dimer mutagenesis====
This method removes redundant codons and stop codons.

====Cassette mutagenesis====
This is a PCR based method. Cassette mutagenesis begins with the synthesis of a DNA cassette containing the gene of interest, which is flanked on either side by restriction sites. The endonuclease which cleaves these restriction sites also cleaves sites in the target plasmid. The DNA cassette and the target plasmid are both treated with endonucleases to cleave these restriction sites and create sticky ends.  Next the products from this cleavage are ligated together, resulting in the insertion  of the gene into the target plasmid. An alternative form of cassette mutagenesis called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis is used to identify the functions of individual amino acid residues in the protein of interest. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis then utilizes information from previous combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Codon cassette mutagenesis allows you to insert or replace a single codon at a particular site in double stranded DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Sexual methods ===
Sexual methods of directed evolution involve ''in vitro'' recombination which mimic natural ''in vivo'' recombination. Generally these techniques require high [[sequence homology]] between parental sequences. These techniques are often used to recombine two different parental genes, and these methods do create cross overs between these genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vitro'' homologous recombination ====
Homologous recombination can be categorized as either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro. In vitro'' homologous recombination mimics natural ''in vivo'' recombination. These ''in vitro'' recombination methods require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques exploit the natural diversity in parental genes by recombining them to yield chimeric genes. The resulting chimera show a blend of parental characteristics.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====DNA shuffling====
This ''in vitro'' technique was one of the first techniques in the era of recombination. It begins with the digestion of homologous parental genes into small fragments by DNase1. These small fragments are then purified from undigested parental genes. Purified fragments are then reassembled using primer-less PCR. This PCR involves homologous fragments from different parental genes priming for each other, resulting in chimeric DNA. The chimeric DNA of parental size is then amplified using end terminal primers in regular PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random priming ''in vitro'' recombination (RPR)====
This ''in vitro'' homologous recombination method begins with the synthesis of many short gene fragments exhibiting point mutations using random sequence primers. These fragments are reassembled to full length parental genes using primer-less PCR. These reassembled sequences are then amplified using PCR and subjected to further selection processes. This method is advantageous relative to DNA shuffling because there is no use of DNase1, thus there is no bias for recombination next to a pyrimidine nucleotide. This method is also advantageous due to its use of synthetic random primers which are uniform in length, and lack biases. Finally this method is independent of the length of DNA template sequence, and requires a small amount of parental DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Truncated metagenomic gene-specific PCR====
This method generates chimeric genes directly from metagenomic samples. It begins with isolation of the desired gene by functional screening from metagenomic DNA sample. Next, specific primers are designed and used to amplify the homologous genes from different environmental samples. Finally, chimeric libraries are generated to retrieve the desired functional clones by shuffling these amplified homologous genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Staggered extension process (StEP)====
This ''in vitro'' method is based on template switching to generate chimeric genes. This PCR based method begins with an initial denaturation of the template, followed by annealing of primers and a short extension time. All subsequent cycle generate annealing between the short fragments generated in previous cycles and different parts of the template. These short fragments and the templates anneal together based on sequence complementarity. This process of fragments annealing template DNA is known as template switching. These annealed fragments will then serve as primers for further extension. This method is carried out until the parental length chimeric gene sequence is obtained. Execution of this method only requires flanking primers to begin. There is also no need for Dnase1 enzyme.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random chimeragenesis on transient templates (RACHITT)====
This method has been shown to generate chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene. It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5' and 3' overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and taq DNA polymerases. The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Synthetic shuffling====
Shuffling of synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides adds flexibility to shuffling methods, since oligonucleotides containing optimal codons and beneficial mutations can be included.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vivo'' Homologous Recombination ====
Cloning performed in yeast involves PCR dependent reassembly of fragmented expression vectors. These reassembled vectors are then introduced to, and cloned in yeast. Using yeast to clone the vector avoids toxicity and counter-selection that would be introduced by ligation and propagation in E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenic organized recombination process by homologous ''in vivo'' grouping (MORPHING)====
This method introduces mutations into specific regions of genes while leaving other parts intact by utilizing the high frequency of homologous recombination in yeast.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE)====
{{main|Phage-assisted continuous evolution}}
This method utilizes a bacteriophage with a modified life cycle to transfer evolving genes from host to host. The phage's life cycle is designed in such a way that the transfer is correlated with the activity of interest from the enzyme. This method is advantageous because it requires minimal human intervention for the continuous evolution of the gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' non-homologous recombination methods ===
These methods are based upon the fact that proteins can exhibit similar structural identity while lacking sequence homology.

===Exon shuffling===
Exon shuffling is the combination of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon shuffling involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon shuffling involves shuffling of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog shuffling involves shuffling of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Incremental truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymes (ITCHY)====
Fragments of parental genes are created using controlled digestion by exonuclease III. These fragments are blunted using endonuclease, and are ligated to produce hybrid genes. THIOITCHY is a modified ITCHY technique which utilized nucleotide triphosphate analogs such as α-phosphothioate dNTPs. Incorporation of these nucleotides blocks digestion by  exonuclease III. This inhibition of digestion by exonuclease III is called spiking. Spiking can be accomplished by first truncating genes with exonuclease to create fragments with short single stranded overhangs. These fragments then serve as templates for amplification by DNA polymerase in the presence of small amounts of phosphothioate dNTPs. These resulting fragments are then ligated together to form full length genes. Alternatively the intact parental genes can be amplified by PCR in the presence of normal dNTPs and phosphothioate dNTPs. These full length amplification products are then subjected to digestion by an exonuclease. Digestion will continue until the exonuclease encounters an α-pdNTP, resulting in fragments of different length. These fragments are then ligated together to generate chimeric genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====SCRATCHY====
This method generates libraries of hybrid genes inhibiting multiple crossovers by combining DNA shuffling and ITCHY. This method begins with the construction of two independent ITCHY libraries. The first with gene A on the N-terminus. And the other having gene B on the N-terminus. These hybrid gene fragments are separated using either restriction enzyme digestion or PCR with terminus primers via agarose gel electrophoresis. These isolated fragments are then mixed together and further digested using DNase1. Digested fragments are then reassembled by primerless PCR with template switching.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Recombined extension on truncated templates (RETT)====
This method generates libraries of hybrid genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides in the presence of single stranded DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of single stranded DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the single stranded DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other single stranded DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length single stranded DNA is obtained.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence homology-independent protein recombination (SHIPREC)====
This method generates recombination between genes with little to no sequence homology. These chimeras are fused via a linker sequence containing several restriction sites. This construct is then digested using DNase1. Fragments are made are made blunt ended using S1 nuclease. These blunt end fragments are put together into a circular sequence by ligation. This circular construct is then linearized using restriction enzymes for which the restriction sites are present in the linker region. This results in a library of chimeric genes in which contribution of genes to 5' and 3' end will be reversed as compared to the starting construct.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence independent site directed chimeragenesis (SISDC)====
This method results in a library of genes with multiple crossovers from several parental genes. This method does not require sequence identity among the parental genes. This does require one or two conserved amino acids at every crossover position. It begins with alignment of parental sequences and identification of consensus regions which serve as crossover sites. This is followed by the incorporation of specific tags containing restriction sites followed by the removal of the tags by digestion with Bac1, resulting in genes with cohesive ends. These gene fragments are mixed and ligated in an appropriate order to form chimeric libraries.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Degenerate homo-duplex recombination (DHR)====
This method begins with alignment of homologous genes, followed by identification of regions of polymorphism. Next the top strand of the gene is divided into small degenerate oligonucleotides. The bottom strand is also digested into oligonucleotides to serve as scaffolds. These fragments are combined in solution are top strand oligonucleotides are assembled onto bottom strand oligonucleotides. Gaps between these fragments are filled with polymerase and ligated.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random multi-recombinant PCR (RM-PCR)====
This method involves the shuffling of plural DNA fragments without homology, in a single PCR. This results in the reconstruction of complete proteins by assembly of modules encoding different structural units.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====User friendly DNA recombination (USERec)====
This method begins with the amplification of gene fragments which need to be recombined, using uracil dNTPs. This amplification solution also contains primers, PfuTurbo, and Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase. Amplified products are next incubated with USER enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of uracil residues from DNA creating single base pair gaps. The USER enzyme treated fragments are mixed and ligated using T4 DNA ligase and subjected to Dpn1 digestion to remove the template DNA. These resulting dingle stranded fragments are subjected to amplification using PCR, and are transformed into E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Golden Gate shuffling (GGS) recombination====
This method allows you to recombine at least 9 different fragments in an acceptor vector by using type 2 restriction enzyme which cuts outside of the restriction sites. It begins with sub cloning of fragments in separate vectors to create Bsa1 flanking sequences on both sides. These vectors are then cleaved using type II restriction enzyme Bsa1, which generates four nucleotide single strand overhangs. Fragments with complementary overhangs are hybridized and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Finally these constructs are then transformed into E. coli cells, which are screened  for expression levels.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phosphoro thioate-based DNA recombination method (PRTec)====
This method can be used to recombine structural elements or entire protein domains. This method is based on phosphorothioate chemistry which allows the specific cleavage of phosphorothiodiester bonds. The first step in the process begins with amplification of fragments that need to be recombined along with the vector backbone. This amplification is accomplished using primers with phosphorothiolated nucleotides at 5' ends. Amplified PCR products are cleaved in an ethanol-iodine solution at high temperatures. Next these fragments are hybridized at room temperature and transformed into E. coli which repair any nicks.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Integron====
This system is based upon a natural site specific recombination system in E. coli. This system is called the integron system, and produces natural gene shuffling. This method was used to construct and optimize a functional tryptophan biosynthetic operon in trp-deficient E. coli by delivering individual recombination cassettes or trpA-E genes along with regulatory elements with the integron system.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Y-Ligation based shuffling (YLBS)====
This method generates single stranded DNA strands, which encompass a single block sequence either at the 5' or 3' end, complementary sequences in a stem loop region, and a D branch  region serving as a primer binding site for PCR. Equivalent amounts of both 5' and 3' half strands are mixed and formed a hybrid due to the complementarity in the stem region. Hybrids with free phosphorylated 5' end in 3' half strands are then ligated with free 3' ends in 5' half strands using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP. Ligated products are then amplified by two types of PCR to generate pre 5' half  and pre 3' half PCR products. These PCR product are converted to single strands via avidin-biotin binding to the 5' end of the primes containing stem sequences that were biotin labeled. Next, biotinylated  5' half strands and non-biotinylated 3' half strands are used as 5' and 3' half strands for the next Y-ligation cycle.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

== Semi-rational design ==
Semi-rational design uses information about a proteins sequence, structure and function, in tandem with predictive algorithms. Together these are used to identify target amino acid residues which are most likely to influence protein function. Mutations of these key amino acid residues create libraries of mutant proteins that are more likely to have enhanced properties.&lt;ref name=pmid20869867&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lutz |first1=Stefan |title=Beyond directed evolution—semi-rational protein engineering and design |journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology |date=December 2010 |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=734–743 |doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.08.011 |pmid=20869867 |pmc=2982887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in semi-rational enzyme engineering and de novo enzyme design provide researchers with powerful and effective new strategies to manipulate biocatalysts. Integration of sequence and structure based approaches in library design has proven to be a great guide for enzyme redesign. Generally, current computational de novo and redesign methods do not compare to evolved variants in catalytic performance. Although experimental optimization may be produced using directed evolution, further improvements in the accuracy of structure predictions and greater catalytic ability will be achieved with improvements in design algorithms. Further functional enhancements may be included in future simulations by integrating protein dynamics.&lt;ref name=pmid20869867/&gt;

Biochemical and biophysical studies, along with fine-tuning of predictive frameworks will be useful to experimentally evaluate the functional significance of individual design features. Better understanding of these functional contributions will then give feedback for the improvement of future designs.&lt;ref name=pmid20869867/&gt;

Directed evolution will likely not be replaced as the method of choice for protein engineering, although computational protein design has fundamentally changed the way protein engineering can manipulate bio-macromolecules. Smaller, more focused and functionally-rich libraries may be generated by using in methods which incorporate predictive frameworks for hypothesis-driven protein engineering. New design strategies and technical advances have begun a departure from traditional protocols, such as directed evolution, which represents the most effective strategy for identifying top-performing candidates in focused libraries. Whole-gene library synthesis is replacing shuffling and mutagenesis protocols for library preparation. Also highly specific low throughput screening assays are increasingly applied in place of monumental screening and selection efforts of millions of candidates. Together, these developments are poised to take protein engineering beyond directed evolution and towards practical, more efficient strategies for tailoring biocatalysts.&lt;ref name=pmid20869867/&gt;

== Screening and selection techniques ==
Once a protein has undergone directed evolution, ration design or semi-ration design, the libraries of mutant proteins must be screened to determine which mutants show enhanced properties. Phage display methods are one option for screening proteins. This method involves the fusion of genes encoding the variant polypeptides with phage coat protein genes. Protein variants expressed on phage surfaces are selected by binding with immobilized targets in vitro. Phages with selected protein variants are then amplified in bacteria, followed by the identification of positive clones by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. These selected phages are then subjected to DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell surface display systems can also be utilized to screen mutant polypeptide libraries. The library mutant genes are incorporated into expression vectors which are then transformed into appropriate host cells. These host cells are subjected to further high throughput screening methods to identify the cells with desired phenotypes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell free display systems have been developed to exploit ''in vitro'' protein translation or cell free translation. These methods include mRNA display, ribosome display, covalent and non covalent DNA display, and ''in vitro'' compartmentalization.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|53}}

===Enzyme engineering===
Enzyme engineering is the application of modifying an enzyme's structure (and, thus, its function) or modifying the catalytic activity of isolated [[enzyme]]s to produce new metabolites, to allow new (catalyzed) pathways for reactions to occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Designer Enzymes' Created By Chemists Have Defense And Medical Uses |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080319160050.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=March 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or to convert from some certain compounds into others ([[biotransformation]]). These products are useful as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fuel, food, or agricultural additives.

An ''enzyme reactor'' &lt;ref&gt;[Enzyme reactors at {{cite web |url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/biology/enztech/reactors.html |title=Enzyme reactors |access-date=2013-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502110325/http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/biology/enztech/reactors.html |archive-date=2012-05-02 }}] Accessed 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a vessel containing a reactional medium that is used to perform a desired conversion by enzymatic means. Enzymes used in this process are free in the solution.

== Examples of engineered proteins ==
Computing methods have been used to design a protein with a novel fold, named [[Top7]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Kuhlman|first1=Brian|title=Design of a Novel Globular Protein Fold with Atomic-Level Accuracy|year=2003|last2=Dantas|last3=Ireton|last4=Varani|last5=Stoddard|last6=Baker|first2=Gautam|first3=Gregory C.|first4=Gabriele|first5=Barry L.|first6=David|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=302|issue=5649|pages=1364–1368|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1364K|doi=10.1126/science.1089427|pmid=14631033|s2cid=1939390 |name-list-style=amp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sensors for unnatural molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Looger|first1=Loren L.|title=Computational design of receptor and sensor proteins with novel functions|year=2003|last2=Dwyer|last3=Smith|last4=Hellinga|first2=Mary A.|first3=James J.|first4=Homme W.|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=423|issue=6936|pages=185–190|bibcode=2003Natur.423..185L|doi=10.1038/nature01556|pmid=12736688|s2cid=4387641 |name-list-style=amp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering of [[fusion protein]]s has yielded [[rilonacept]], a pharmaceutical that has secured [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for treating [[cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome]].

Another computing method, IPRO, successfully engineered the switching of cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization (IPRO) redesigns proteins to increase or give specificity to native or novel [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrates]] and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. This is done by repeatedly randomly perturbing the structure of the proteins around specified design positions, identifying the lowest energy combination of [[Conformational isomerism|rotamers]], and determining whether the new design has a lower binding energy than prior ones.&lt;ref&gt;The iterative nature of this process allows IPRO to make additive mutations to a protein sequence that collectively improve the specificity toward desired substrates and/or cofactors. Details on how to download the software, implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and experimental testing of predictions are outlined in this paper: {{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computation-aided design has also been used to engineer complex properties of a highly ordered nano-protein assembly.&lt;ref name="Ardejani"&gt;{{Citation|title=Stabilization of a Protein Nanocage through the Plugging of a Protein–Protein Interfacial Water Pocket|date=April 2011|last1=Ardejani|last2=Li|last3=Orner|first1=MS|first2=NX|first3=BP|journal=Biochemistry|volume=50|issue=19|pages=4029–4037|doi=10.1021/bi200207w|pmid=21488690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protein cage, E. coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr), which naturally shows structural instability and an incomplete self-assembly behavior by populating two oligomerization states, is the model protein in this study. Through computational analysis and comparison to its [[Protein homology|homologs]], it has been found that this protein has a smaller-than-average [[Protein dimer|dimeric interface]] on its two-fold symmetry axis due mainly to the existence of an interfacial water pocket centered on two water-bridged asparagine residues. To investigate the possibility of engineering EcBfr for modified structural stability, a semi-empirical computational method is used to virtually explore the energy differences of the 480 possible mutants at the dimeric interface relative to the [[wild type]] EcBfr.  This computational study also converges on the water-bridged [[asparagine]]s. Replacing these two asparagines with [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] amino acids results in proteins that fold into [[Alpha helix|alpha-helical]] monomers and assemble into cages as evidenced by circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. Both thermal and chemical denaturation confirm that, all redesigned proteins, in agreement with the calculations, possess increased stability.  One of the three mutations shifts the population in favor of the higher order oligomerization state in solution as shown by both size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="Ardejani" /&gt;

Transport experiments on the narrowest designed pores revealed complete salt rejection when assembled in biomimetic block-polymer matrices.

In 1995 Australian researcher Susanna Holt developed the concept of [[satiety value]], a measure of how much a given food is likely to satisfy the hunger of someone. High protein foods have been found to have high satiety values, though these are outmatched by potatoes and oats (which have a high [[glycemic index]]). Fruits rank similarly to high protein foods (likely due to their high level of dietary fibre).

'''Protein precipitation''' is widely used in [[downstream processing]] of biological products in order to concentrate proteins and [[protein purification|purify]] them from various contaminants. For example, in the [[biotechnology]] industry protein precipitation is used to eliminate contaminants commonly contained in blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmaceutical-int.com/categories/protein-precipitation/protein-precipitation-plates-tubes.asp |title=Protein Precipitation Plates and Tubes - Pharmaceutical International |accessdate=2006-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018024329/http://www.pharmaceutical-int.com/categories/protein-precipitation/protein-precipitation-plates-tubes.asp |archivedate=18 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying mechanism of precipitation is to alter the [[solvation potential]] of the solvent, more specifically, by lowering the [[solubility]] of the solute by addition of a reagent.

==General principles==
The [[solubility]] of proteins in aqueous buffers depends on the distribution of [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]] amino acid residues on the protein's surface. Hydrophobic residues predominantly occur in the globular protein core, but some exist in patches on the surface. Proteins that have high hydrophobic [[amino acid]] content on the surface have low solubility in an aqueous solvent. Charged and polar surface residues interact with ionic groups in the solvent and increase the solubility of a protein. Knowledge of a protein's amino acid composition will aid in determining an ideal precipitation solvent and methods.

===Repulsive electrostatic force===
Repulsive electrostatic forces form when proteins are dissolved in an [[electrolyte]] solution. These repulsive forces between proteins prevent aggregation and facilitate dissolution.  Upon dissolution in an electrolyte solution, solvent [[counterion]]s migrate towards charged surface residues on the protein, forming a rigid matrix of counterions on the protein's surface.  Next to this layer is another solvation layer that is less rigid and, as one moves away from the protein surface, contains a decreasing concentration of counterions and an increasing concentration of co-ions.  The presence of these solvation layers cause the protein to have fewer ionic interactions with other proteins and decreases the likelihood of aggregation.
Repulsive electrostatic forces also form when proteins are dissolved in water. Water forms a solvation layer around the hydrophilic surface residues of a protein. Water establishes a concentration gradient around the protein, with the highest concentration at the protein surface. This water network has a damping effect on the attractive forces between proteins.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Attractive electrostatic force===
Dispersive or attractive forces exist between proteins through permanent and induced [[dipoles]]. For example, basic residues on a protein can have electrostatic interactions with acidic residues on another protein.  However, solvation by ions in an electrolytic solution or water will decrease protein–protein attractive forces.  Therefore, to precipitate or induce accumulation of proteins, the hydration layer around the protein should be reduced.  The purpose of the added reagents in protein precipitation is to reduce the hydration layer.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Precipitate formation===
Protein precipitate formation occurs in a stepwise process.  First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed.  Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies.  Next, proteins undergo a [[nucleation]] phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1&amp;nbsp;µm to 10&amp;nbsp;µm for high and low [[Shear (fluid)|shear]] fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or [[flocculating]]. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with the product of the mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.

==Methods==
===Salting out===
[[Salting out]] is the most common method used to precipitate a protein. Addition of a neutral salt, such as [[ammonium sulfate]], compresses the solvation layer and increases protein–protein interactions. As the salt concentration of a solution is increased, the charges on the surface of the protein interact with the salt, not the water, thereby exposing hydrophobic patches on  the protein surface and causing the protein to fall out of solution (aggregate and precipitate).

====Energetics involved in salting out====
Salting out is a [[spontaneous process]] when the right concentration of the salt is reached in solution. The hydrophobic patches on the protein surface generate highly ordered water shells. This results in a small decrease in [[enthalpy]], Δ''H'', and a larger decrease in [[entropy]], Δ''S,'' of the ordered water molecules relative to the molecules in the bulk solution. The overall [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] change, Δ''G'', of the process is given by the Gibbs free energy equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S.&lt;/math&gt;

Δ''G'' = Free energy change, Δ''H'' = Enthalpy change upon precipitation, Δ''S'' = Entropy change upon precipitation, ''T'' = Absolute temperature.
When water molecules in the rigid solvation layer are brought back into the bulk phase through interactions with the added salt, their greater freedom of movement causes a significant increase in their entropy. Thus, Δ''G'' becomes negative and precipitation occurs spontaneously.

====[[Hofmeister series]]====
Kosmotropes or "water structure stabilizers" are salts which promote the dissipation / dispersion of water from the solvation layer around a protein. Hydrophobic patches are then exposed on the protein's surface, and they interact with hydrophobic patches on other proteins. These salts enhance protein aggregation and precipitation. Chaotropes or "water structure breakers," have the opposite effect of Kosmotropes. These salts promote an increase in the solvation layer around a protein. The effectiveness of the kosmotropic salts in precipitating proteins follows the order of the Hofmeister series:

Most precipitation &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ PO_{4}^{3-} &gt; SO_{4}^{2-} &gt; COO^{-} &gt; Cl^{-}}&lt;/math&gt; least precipitation

Most precipitation &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ NH_{4}^{+} &gt; K^{+} &gt; Na^{+}}&lt;/math&gt; least precipitation

====Salting out in practice====
The decrease in protein solubility follows a [[Normalizing constant|normalized]] solubility curve of the type shown. The relationship between the solubility of a protein and increasing ionic strength of the solution can be represented by the [[Cohn]] equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \log S = B - KI \,&lt;/math&gt;

''S'' = solubility of the protein, ''B'' is idealized solubility, ''K'' is a salt-specific constant and ''I'' is the ionic strength of the solution, which is attributed to the added salt.

&lt;math&gt; I = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i}z_{i}^{2} &lt;/math&gt;

''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ion charge of the salt and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the salt concentration. The ideal salt for protein precipitation is most effective for a particular amino acid composition, inexpensive, non-buffering, and non-polluting. The most commonly used salt is [[ammonium sulfate]]. There is a low variation in salting out over temperatures 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 30&amp;nbsp;°C. Protein precipitates left in the salt solution can remain stable for years-protected from [[proteolysis]] and bacterial contamination by the high salt concentrations.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Isoelectric precipitation===
The [[isoelectric point]] (pI) is the pH of a solution at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At a solution pH that is above the pI the surface of the protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as [[hydrochloric]] and [[sulfuric acid]] are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric point precipitation is the irreversible [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] caused by the mineral acids. For this reason isoelectric point precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the target protein. The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of sodium caseinate, is an isoelectric precipitation.

===Precipitation with miscible solvents===
Addition of [[miscible]] solvents such as [[ethanol]] or [[methanol]] to a solution may cause proteins in the solution to precipitate. The solvation layer around the protein will decrease as the organic solvent progressively displaces water from the protein surface and binds it in hydration layers around the organic solvent molecules. With smaller hydration layers, the proteins can aggregate by attractive electrostatic and dipole forces. Important parameters to consider are temperature, which should be less than 0&amp;nbsp;°C to avoid [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], pH and protein concentration in solution. Miscible organic solvents decrease the [[dielectric constant]] of water, which in effect allows two proteins to come close together. At the [[isoelectric point]] the relationship between the dielectric constant and protein solubility is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; \log S = k/e^{2} + \log S^{0} \,&lt;/math&gt;

''S''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is an extrapolated value of ''S'', ''e'' is the dielectric constant of the mixture and ''k'' is a constant that relates to the dielectric constant of water. The [[Cohn process]] for plasma protein fractionation relies on solvent precipitation with ethanol to isolate individual plasma proteins.

a clinical application for the use of methanol as a protein precipitating agent is in the estimation of bilirubin.

===Non-ionic hydrophilic polymers===
[[Polymers]], such as [[dextrans]] and [[polyethylene glycol]]s, are frequently used to precipitate proteins because they have low flammability and are less likely to denature biomaterials than isoelectric precipitation. These polymers in solution attract water molecules away from the solvation layer around the protein. This increases the protein–protein interactions and enhances precipitation. For the specific case of polyethylene glycol, precipitation can be modeled by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \ln(S) + pS = X - aC \,&lt;/math&gt;

''C'' is the polymer concentration, ''P'' is a protein–protein interaction coefficient, ''a'' is a protein–polymer interaction coefficient and

:&lt;math&gt; x = (\mu_i - \mu_i^{0})RT &lt;/math&gt;

''μ'' is the [[chemical potential]] of component I, ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]] and ''T'' is the absolute temperature.

===Flocculation by polyelectrolytes===
[[Alginate]], carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylic acid, [[tannic acid]] and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The effectiveness of these [[polyelectrolytes]] depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It is important to note that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using [[Chondrus crispus|Irish moss]].

===Polyvalent metallic ions===
Metal salts can be used at low concentrations to precipitate enzymes and [[nucleic acids]] from solutions. Polyvalent metal [[ions]] frequently used are Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Precipitation reactors==
There are numerous industrial scaled reactors than can be used to precipitate large amounts of proteins, such as recombinant [[DNA polymerases]] from a solution.[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1394294]

===Batch reactors===
Batch reactors are the simplest type of precipitation reactor. The precipitating agent is slowly added to the protein solution under mixing. The aggregating protein particles tend to be compact and regular in shape. Since the particles are exposed to a wide range of shear stresses for a long period of time, they tend to be compact, dense and mechanically stable.

===Tubular reactors===
In tubular reactors, feed protein solution and the precipitating reagent are contacted in a zone of efficient mixing then fed into long tubes where precipitation takes place. The fluid in volume elements approach [[plug flow]] as they move though the tubes of the reactor. Turbulent flow is promoted through wire mesh inserts in the tube. The tubular reactor does not require moving mechanical parts and is inexpensive to build. However, the reactor can become impractically long if the particles aggregate slowly.

===Continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR)===
[[Continuous stirred-tank reactor model|CSTR]] reactors run at [[steady state]] with a continuous flow of reactants and products in a well-mixed tank. Fresh protein feed contacts [[slurry]] that already contains precipitate particles and the precipitation reagents.

'''Protein production''' is the [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] process of generating a specific [[protein]]. It is typically achieved by the manipulation of [[gene expression]] in an organism such that it [[heterologous expression|expresses]] large amounts of a [[recombinant gene]]. This includes the [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] of the [[recombinant DNA]] to messenger [[RNA]] ([[mRNA]]), the [[translation (biology)|translation]] of mRNA into [[polypeptide]] chains, which are ultimately folded into functional [[proteins]] and may be [[protein targeting|targeted]] to specific subcellular or extracellular locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gräslund S, Nordlund P, Weigelt J, Hallberg BM, Bray J, Gileadi O, Knapp S, Oppermann U, Arrowsmith C, Hui R, Ming J, dhe-Paganon S, Park HW, Savchenko A, Yee A, Edwards A, Vincentelli R, Cambillau C, Kim R, Kim SH, Rao Z, Shi Y, Terwilliger TC, Kim CY, Hung LW, Waldo GS, Peleg Y, Albeck S, Unger T, Dym O, Prilusky J, Sussman JL, Stevens RC, Lesley SA, Wilson IA, Joachimiak A, Collart F, Dementieva I, Donnelly MI, Eschenfeldt WH, Kim Y, Stols L, Wu R, Zhou M, Burley SK, Emtage JS, Sauder JM, Thompson D, Bain K, Luz J, Gheyi T, Zhang F, Atwell S, Almo SC, Bonanno JB, Fiser A, Swaminathan S, Studier FW, Chance MR, Sali A, Acton TB, Xiao R, Zhao L, Ma LC, Hunt JF, Tong L, Cunningham K, Inouye M, Anderson S, Janjua H, Shastry R, Ho CK, Wang D, Wang H, Jiang M, Montelione GT, Stuart DI, Owens RJ, Daenke S, Schütz A, Heinemann U, Yokoyama S, Büssow K, Gunsalus KC | display-authors = 6 | title = Protein production and purification | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–46 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18235434 | pmc = 3178102 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.f.202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein production systems (also known as [[expression system]]s) are used in the [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], and [[medicine]]. [[Molecular biology]] research uses numerous proteins and enzymes, many of which are from expression systems; particularly [[DNA polymerase]] for [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], [[reverse transcriptase]] for RNA analysis, [[restriction endonuclease]]s for cloning, and to make proteins that are screened in [[drug discovery]] as [[biological target]]s or as potential drugs themselves. There are also significant applications for expression systems in [[industrial fermentation]], notably the production of [[biopharmaceuticals]] such as human [[insulin]] to treat [[diabetes]], and to manufacture [[Enzyme#Industrial applications|enzymes]].

The oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the "''combination of an [[expression vector]], its cloned DNA, and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell, that is, produce proteins at a high level''".&lt;ref name="urlDefinition: expression system from Online Medical Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?expression+system | title = Definition: expression system  | date = 1997-11-13 | work = Online Medical Dictionary | publisher = Centre for Cancer Education, University of Newcastle upon Tyne: Cancerweb | access-date = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlExpression system"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Expression_system | title = Expression system - definition | date = 2005-10-03 | work = Biology Online | publisher = Biology-Online.org | access-date = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexpression is an abnormally and excessively high level of [[gene expression]] which produces a pronounced gene-related [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name="Overexpression - Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|title=overexpression|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/overexpression|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210181025/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/overexpression|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 10, 2018|website=Oxford Living Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=18 May 2017|date=2017|quote=The production of abnormally large amounts of a substance which is coded for by a particular gene or group of genes; the appearance in the phenotype to an abnormally high degree of a character or effect attributed to a particular gene.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Overexpress - NCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=overexpress|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=45812|website=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|publisher=National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health|access-date=18 May 2017|quote=overexpress&lt;br /&gt;In biology, to make too many copies of a protein or other substance.

There are many ways to introduce foreign [[DNA]] to a cell for expression, and many different host cells may be used for expression — each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities. Expression systems are normally referred to by the [[Host (biology)|host]] and the DNA source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material. For example, common hosts are [[bacteria]] (such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E.coli]]'', ''[[B. subtilis]]''), [[yeast]] (such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S.cerevisiae]]''&lt;ref name="pmid21943899"/&gt;) or eukaryotic [[cell lines]]. Common DNA sources and delivery mechanisms are [[virus]]es (such as [[baculovirus]], [[retrovirus]], [[adenovirus]]), [[plasmid]]s, [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|artificial chromosome]]s and [[bacteriophage]] (such as [[lambda phage|lambda]]). The best expression system depends on the [[gene]] involved, for example the ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is often preferred for proteins that require significant [[posttranslational modification]]. [[Insect]] or [[mammal]] cell lines are used when human-like splicing of mRNA is required. Nonetheless, bacterial expression has the advantage of easily producing large amounts of protein, which is required for [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] experiments for structure determination.

Because bacteria are [[prokaryote]]s, they are not equipped with the full enzymatic machinery to accomplish the required post-translational modifications or molecular folding. Hence, multi-domain eukaryotic proteins expressed in bacteria often are non-functional. Also, many proteins become insoluble as inclusion bodies that are difficult to recover without harsh denaturants and subsequent cumbersome protein-refolding.

To address these concerns, expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in, or closer to eukaryotic organisms: cells of plants (i.e. tobacco), of insects or mammalians (i.e. bovines) are transfected with genes and cultured in suspension and even as tissues or whole organisms, to produce fully folded proteins. Mammalian ''[[in vivo]]'' expression systems have however low yield and other limitations (time-consuming, toxicity to host cells,..). To combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast, and advanced epigenetic features of plants, insects and mammalians systems, other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes (i.e. non-pathogenic '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''[[Leishmania]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' cells).

==== Bacterial systems ====

===== ''Escherichia coli'' =====
[[File:EscherichiaColi NIAID.jpg|thumb|right|''E. coli'', one of the most popular hosts for artificial gene expression.]]
''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' is one of the most widely used expression hosts, and DNA is normally introduced in a [[plasmid]] expression vector. The techniques for overexpression in ''E. coli'' are well developed and work by increasing the number of copies of the gene or increasing the binding strength of the promoter region so assisting transcription.

For example, a DNA sequence for a protein of interest could be [[cloning#Cloning in biology|cloned]] or [[subcloning|subcloned]] into a high copy-number plasmid containing the ''[[lac operon|lac]]'' (often [[LacUV5]]) promoter, which is then [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] into the bacterium ''E. coli''. Addition of [[IPTG]] (a [[lactose]] analog) activates the lac promoter and causes the bacteria to express the protein of interest.

''E. coli'' strain BL21 and BL21(DE3) are two strains commonly used for protein production. As members of the B lineage, they lack ''[[Lon protease family|lon]]'' and ''[[OmpT]]'' proteases, protecting the produced proteins from degradation. The DE3 prophage found in BL21(DE3) provides [[T7 RNA polymerase]] (driven by the LacUV5 promoter), allowing for vectors with the T7 promoter to be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jeong |first1=H |last2=Barbe |first2=V |last3=Lee |first3=CH |last4=Vallenet |first4=D |last5=Yu |first5=DS |last6=Choi |first6=SH |last7=Couloux |first7=A |last8=Lee |first8=SW |last9=Yoon |first9=SH |last10=Cattolico |first10=L |last11=Hur |first11=CG |last12=Park |first12=HS |last13=Ségurens |first13=B |last14=Kim |first14=SC |last15=Oh |first15=TK |last16=Lenski |first16=RE |last17=Studier |first17=FW |last18=Daegelen |first18=P |last19=Kim |first19=JF |title=Genome sequences of Escherichia coli B strains REL606 and BL21(DE3). |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date=11 December 2009 |volume=394 |issue=4 |pages=644–52 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2009.09.052 |pmid=19786035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== ''Corynebacterium'' =====
Non-pathogenic species of the gram-positive ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' are used for the commercial production of various amino acids. The ''[[Corynebacterium glutamicum|C. glutamicum]]'' species is widely used for producing [[glutamate]] and [[lysine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brinkrolf K, Schröder J, Pühler A, Tauch A | title = The transcriptional regulatory repertoire of Corynebacterium glutamicum: reconstruction of the network controlling pathways involved in lysine and glutamate production | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 173–82 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 19963020 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; components of human food, animal feed and pharmaceutical products.

Expression of functionally active human [[epidermal growth factor]] has been done in ''C. glutamicum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Date M, Itaya H, Matsui H, Kikuchi Y | title = Secretion of human epidermal growth factor by Corynebacterium glutamicum | journal = Letters in Applied Microbiology | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–70 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16411922 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-765x.2005.01802.x | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating a potential for industrial-scale production of human proteins. Expressed proteins can be targeted for secretion through either the general, [[secretory pathway]] (Sec) or the [[twin-arginine translocation pathway]] (Tat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meissner D, Vollstedt A, van Dijl JM, Freudl R | title = Comparative analysis of twin-arginine (Tat)-dependent protein secretion of a heterologous model protein (GFP) in three different Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–42 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17453196 | doi = 10.1007/s00253-007-0934-8 | s2cid = 6238466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[gram-negative bacteria]], the gram-positive ''Corynebacterium'' lack [[lipopolysaccharides]] that function as antigenic [[endotoxins]] in humans.

===== ''Pseudomonas fluorescens'' =====
The non-pathogenic and gram-negative bacteria, ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'', is used for high level production of recombinant proteins; commonly for the development bio-therapeutics and vaccines.  '' P. fluorescens'' is a metabolically versatile organism, allowing for high throughput screening and rapid development of complex proteins. ''P. fluorescens''  is most well known for its ability to rapid and successfully produce high titers of active, soluble protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Retallack DM, Jin H, Chew L | title = Reliable protein production in a Pseudomonas fluorescens expression system | journal = Protein Expression and Purification | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–65 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 21968453 | doi = 10.1016/j.pep.2011.09.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eukaryotic systems ====

===== Yeasts =====
Expression systems using either ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' or ''[[Pichia pastoris]]'' allow stable and lasting production of proteins that are processed similarly to mammalian cells, at high yield, in chemically defined media of proteins.

===== Filamentous fungi =====

Filamentous fungi, especially ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma]]'', but also more recently ''[[Myceliophthora thermophila]]'' C1&lt;ref name="Visser 214–223"/&gt; have been developed into expression platforms for screening and production of diverse [[industrial enzymes]]. The expression system C1 shows a low viscosity morphology in submerged culture, enabling the use of complex growth and production media.

===== Non-lytic insect cell expression =====
Non-lytic insect cell expression is an alternative to the lytic baculovirus expression system.

===== ''[[Excavata]]'' =====
''[[Leishmania]] tarentolae'' (cannot infect mammals) expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield, in chemically defined media. Produced proteins exhibit fully eukaryotic post-translational modifications, including [[glycosylation]] and disulfide bond formation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Cell-free systems===
Cell-free production of proteins is performed ''in vitro'' using purified RNA polymerase, ribosomes, tRNA and ribonucleotides.

'''Protein purification''' is a series of processes intended to isolate one or a few [[protein]]s from a complex mixture, usually [[Cell biology|cells]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] or whole organisms.  Protein purification is vital for the specification  of the function, structure and interactions of the protein of interest. The purification process may separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity and [[biological activity]].  The pure result may be termed '''protein isolate'''.

== Purpose ==
Protein purification is either ''preparative'' or ''analytical''. '''Preparative purifications''' aim to produce a relatively large quantity of purified proteins for subsequent use. Examples include the preparation of commercial products such as [[enzymes]] (e.g. [[lactase]]), nutritional proteins (e.g. [[soy protein]] isolate), and certain [[biopharmaceutical]]s (e.g. [[insulin]]). Several preparative purifications steps are often deployed to remove bi-products, such as [[host cell protein]]s, which poses as a potential threat to the patient's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Hunter AK, Mozier NM | title = Host cell proteins in biologics development: Identification, quantitation and risk assessment | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 446–58 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19388135 | doi = 10.1002/bit.22304 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Analytical purification''' produces a relatively small amount of a protein for a variety of research or analytical purposes, including identification, quantification, and studies of the [[Proteins#Structure|protein's structure]], [[post-translational modification]]s and function. [[Pepsin]] and [[urease]] were the first proteins purified to the point that they could be crystallized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1946 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/|access-date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preliminary steps==

=== Extraction ===
If the protein of interest is not secreted by the organism into the surrounding solution, the first step of each purification process is the disruption of the cells containing the protein. Depending on how fragile the protein is and how stable the cells are, one could, for instance, use one of the following methods: i) repeated freezing and thawing, ii) [[sonication]], iii) homogenization by high pressure ([[French pressure cell press|French press]]), iv) homogenization by grinding (bead mill), and v) permeabilization by detergents (e.g. [[Triton X-100]]) and/or enzymes (e.g. [[lysozyme]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Protein Purification - Springer|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4757-2333-5 |first = Robert K. |last = Scopes | name-list-style = vanc |year = 1994|isbn = 978-1-4419-2833-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the cell debris can be removed by centrifugation so that the proteins and other soluble compounds remain in the supernatant.

Also [[protease]]s are released during cell [[lysis]], which will start digesting the proteins in the solution. If the protein of interest is sensitive to [[proteolysis]], it is recommended to proceed quickly, and to keep the extract cooled, to slow down the digestion. Alternatively, one or more [[Protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitors]] can be added to the lysis buffer immediately before cell disruption. Sometimes it is also necessary to add [[Deoxyribonuclease|DNAse]] in order to reduce the viscosity of the cell lysate caused by a high [[DNA]] content.

=== Precipitation and differential solubilization ===
{{main|Ammonium sulfate precipitation}}
In bulk protein purification, a common first step to isolate proteins is [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] with [[ammonium sulfate]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wingfield P | title = Protein precipitation using ammonium sulfate | journal = Current Protocols in Protein Science | volume = Appendix 3 | pages = A.3F.1–A.3F.8 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 18429073 | pmc = 4817497 | doi = 10.1002/0471140864.psa03fs13 | isbn = 978-0471140863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is performed by adding increasing amounts of ammonium sulfate and collecting the different fractions of precipitated protein. Subsequently, ammonium sulfate can be removed using [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]]. During the ammonium sulfate precipitation step, hydrophobic groups present on the proteins are exposed to the atmosphere, attracting other hydrophobic groups; the result is formation of an aggregate of hydrophobic components. In this case, the protein precipitate will typically be visible to the [[naked eye]]. One advantage of this method is that it can be performed inexpensively, even with very large volumes.

The first proteins to be purified are water-soluble proteins. Purification of [[Membrane protein|integral membrane proteins]] requires disruption of the [[cell membrane]] in order to isolate any one particular protein from others that are in the same membrane compartment. Sometimes a particular membrane fraction can be isolated first, such as isolating [[mitochondria]] from cells before purifying a protein located in a mitochondrial membrane. A [[detergent]] such as [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) can be used to dissolve cell membranes and keep membrane proteins in solution during purification; however, because SDS causes [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], milder detergents such as [[Triton X-100]] or [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] can be used to retain the protein's native conformation during complete purification.

=== Ultracentrifugation ===
{{main|Ultracentrifuge}}
'''[[Centrifugation]]''' is a process that uses [[centrifugal force]] to separate mixtures of particles of varying masses or densities suspended in a liquid. When a vessel (typically a tube or bottle) containing a mixture of proteins or other particulate matter, such as bacterial cells, is rotated at high speeds, the [[inertia]] of each particle yields a force in the direction of the particles velocity that is proportional to its mass. The tendency of a given particle to move through the liquid because of this force is offset by the resistance the liquid exerts on the particle. The net effect of "spinning" the sample in a [[centrifuge]] is that massive, small, and dense particles move outward faster than less massive particles or particles with more "drag" in the liquid. When suspensions of particles are "spun" in a centrifuge, a "pellet" may form at the bottom of the vessel that is enriched for the most massive particles with low drag in the liquid.

Non-compacted particles remain mostly in the liquid called "supernatant" and can be removed from the vessel thereby separating the supernatant from the pellet.  The rate of centrifugation is determined by the angular [[acceleration]] applied to the sample, typically measured in comparison to the [[g-force|''g'']].  If samples are centrifuged long enough, the particles in the vessel will reach equilibrium wherein the particles accumulate specifically at a point in the vessel where their buoyant density is balanced with centrifugal force.  Such an "equilibrium" centrifugation can allow extensive purification of a given particle.

[[Sucrose gradient centrifugation]] &amp;mdash; a linear concentration gradient of sugar (typically sucrose, glycerol, or a silica based density gradient media, like [[Percoll]]) is generated in a tube such that the highest concentration is on the bottom and lowest on top. Percoll is a trademark owned by GE Healthcare companies. A protein sample is then layered on top of the gradient and spun at high speeds in an [[ultracentrifuge]]. This causes heavy macromolecules to migrate towards the bottom of the tube faster than lighter material.  During centrifugation in the absence of sucrose, as particles move farther and farther from the center of rotation, they experience more and more centrifugal force (the further they move, the faster they move).  The problem with this is that the useful separation range within the vessel is restricted to a small observable window.  Spinning a sample twice as long doesn't mean the particle of interest will go twice as far, in fact, it will go significantly further.  However, when the proteins are moving through a sucrose gradient, they encounter liquid of increasing density and viscosity.  A properly designed sucrose gradient will counteract the increasing centrifugal force so the particles move in close proportion to the time they have been in the centrifugal field.  Samples separated by these gradients are referred to as "rate zonal" centrifugations.  After separating the protein/particles, the gradient is then fractionated and collected.

== Purification strategies ==
[[File:Size exclusion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chromatographic equipment. Here set up for a size exclusion chromatography. The buffer is pumped through the column (right) by a computer controlled device.]]
Choice of a starting material is key to the design of a purification process.  In a plant or animal, a particular protein usually isn't distributed homogeneously throughout the body; different organs or tissues have higher or lower concentrations of the protein.  Use of only the tissues or organs with the highest concentration decreases the volumes needed to produce a given amount of purified protein. If the protein is present in low abundance, or if it has a high value, scientists may use [[recombinant DNA]] technology to develop cells that will produce large quantities of the desired protein (this is known as an [[expression system]]). Recombinant expression allows the protein to be tagged, e.g. by a [[His-tag]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spriestersbach A, Kubicek J, Schäfer F, Block H, Maertens B | title = Purification of His-Tagged Proteins | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 559 | pages = 1–15 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26096499 | doi = 10.1016/bs.mie.2014.11.003 | publisher = Elsevier | isbn = 9780128002797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Strep-tag]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt TG, Skerra A | title = The Strep-tag system for one-step purification and high-affinity detection or capturing of proteins | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 1528–35 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17571060 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.209 | s2cid = 25209313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate purification, reducing the number of purification steps required.

An analytical purification generally utilizes three properties to separate proteins.  First, proteins may be purified according to their isoelectric points by running them through a pH graded gel or an ion exchange column.  Second, proteins can be separated according to their size or molecular weight via [[size exclusion chromatography]] or by [[SDS-PAGE]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analysis. Proteins are often purified by using [[2D-PAGE]] and are then analysed by [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] to establish the protein identity. This is very useful for scientific purposes and the detection limits for protein are nowadays very low and nanogram amounts of protein are sufficient for their analysis. Thirdly, proteins may be separated by polarity/hydrophobicity via [[high performance liquid chromatography]] or [[reversed-phase chromatography]].

Usually a protein purification protocol contains one or more chromatographic steps. The basic procedure in chromatography is to flow the solution containing the protein through a column packed with various materials. Different proteins interact differently with the column material, and can thus be separated by the time required to pass the column, or the conditions required to elute the protein from the column. Usually proteins are detected as they are coming off the column by their absorbance at 280&amp;nbsp;nm. Many different chromatographic methods exist:

=== Size exclusion chromatography ===
{{main|Gel permeation chromatography}}
[[Chromatography]] can be used to separate protein in solution or [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing conditions]] by using porous gels. This technique is known as  [[Size Exclusion Chromatography|size exclusion chromatography]]. The principle is that smaller molecules have to traverse a larger volume in a porous matrix. Consequentially, proteins of a certain range in size will require a variable volume of eluent (solvent) before being collected at the other end of the column of gel.

In the context of protein purification, the [[eluent]] is usually pooled in different test tubes. All test tubes containing no measurable trace of the protein to purify are discarded. The remaining solution is thus made of the protein to purify and any other similarly-sized proteins.

=== Separation based on charge or hydrophobicity ===

==== Hydrophobic interaction chromatography ====

HIC media is amphiphilic, with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, allowing for separation of proteins based on their surface hydrophobicity. Target proteins and their product aggregate species tend to have different hydrophobic properties and removing them via HIC further purifies the protein of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McCue|first=Justin T.|date=2009|title=Theory and use of hydrophobic interaction chromatography in protein purification applications|journal=Methods in Enzymology|volume=463|pages=405–414|doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(09)63025-1|issn=1557-7988|pmid=19892185|isbn=9780123745361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the environment used typically employs less harsh denaturing conditions than other chromatography techniques, thus helping to preserve the protein of interest in its native and functional state. In pure water, the interactions between the resin and the hydrophobic regions of protein would be very weak, but this interaction is enhanced by applying a protein sample to HIC resin in high ionic strength buffer. The ionic strength of the buffer is then reduced to elute proteins in order of decreasing hydrophobicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kennedy|first=RM|title=Hydrophobic chromatography.|journal=Methods in Enzymology|year=1990|volume=182|pages=339–43|pmid=2314246|doi=10.1016/0076-6879(90)82029-2|isbn=9780121820831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ion exchange chromatography ====
{{main|Ion exchange chromatography}}
Ion exchange chromatography separates compounds according to the nature and degree of their ionic charge.   The column to be used is selected according to its type and strength of charge. Anion exchange resins have a positive charge and are used to retain and separate negatively charged compounds (anions), while cation exchange resins have a negative charge and are used to separate positively charged molecules (cations).

Before the separation begins a buffer is pumped through the column to equilibrate the opposing charged ions.  Upon injection of the sample, solute molecules will exchange with the buffer ions as each competes for the binding sites on the resin.  The length of retention for each solute depends upon the strength of its charge.  The most weakly charged compounds will elute first, followed by those with successively stronger charges.  Because of the nature of the separating mechanism, pH, buffer type, buffer concentration, and temperature all play important roles in controlling the separation.

Ion exchange chromatography is a very powerful tool for use in protein purification and is frequently used in both analytical and preparative separations.

[[Image:Metal-affinity column.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nickel]]-affinity column. The resin is blue since it has bound nickel.]]

==== Free-flow-electrophoresis ====
{{main|Free-flow electrophoresis}}

Free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) is a carrier-free electrophoresis technique that allows preparative protein separation in a laminar buffer stream by using an orthogonal electric field. By making use of a pH-gradient, that can for example be induced by [[ampholytes]], this technique allows to separate [[protein isoforms]] up to a resolution of &lt; 0.02 delta-pI.

=== Affinity chromatography===
{{main|Affinity chromatography}}
Affinity Chromatography is a separation technique based upon molecular conformation, which frequently utilizes application specific resins.  These resins have [[ligand]]s attached to their surfaces which are specific for the compounds to be separated.  Most frequently, these ligands function in a fashion similar to that of antibody-antigen interactions.  This "lock and key" fit between the ligand and its target compound makes it highly specific, frequently generating a single peak, while all else in the sample is unretained.

Many membrane proteins are [[glycoprotein]]s and can be purified by [[lectin]] affinity chromatography. Detergent-solubilized proteins can be allowed to bind to a chromatography resin that has been modified to have a covalently attached lectin. Proteins that do not bind to the lectin are washed away and then specifically bound glycoproteins can be eluted by adding a high concentration of a sugar that competes with the bound glycoproteins at the lectin binding site. Some lectins have high affinity binding to [[oligosaccharides]] of glycoproteins that is hard to compete with sugars, and bound glycoproteins need to be released by denaturing the lectin.

==== Immunoaffinity chromatography ====
[[Image:hplc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An HPLC. From left to right: A pumping device generating a gradient of two different solvents, a steel enforced column and an apparatus for measuring the absorbance.]]
{{main|Immunoaffinity chromatography}}
Immunoaffinity chromatography uses the specific binding of an [[antibody]]-antigen to selectively purify the target protein. The procedure involves immobilizing a protein to a solid substrate (e.g. a porous bead or a membrane), which then selectively binds the target, while everything else flows through. The target protein can be eluted by changing the [[pH]] or the [[salinity]]. The immobilized ligand can be an antibody (such as [[Immunoglobulin G]]) or it can be a protein (such as [[Protein A]]). Because this method does not involve engineering in a tag, it can be used for proteins from natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehle H, Horn A | title = Immunoaffinity chromatography of enzymes | journal = Bioseparation | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–110 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1368167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Purification of a tagged protein ====

Another way to tag proteins is to engineer an [[antigen]] peptide tag onto the protein, and then purify the protein on a column or by incubating with a loose resin that is coated with an immobilized [[antibody]]. This particular procedure is known as [[immunoprecipitation]].  [[Immunoprecipitation]] is quite capable of generating an extremely specific interaction which usually results in binding only the desired protein.  The purified tagged proteins can then easily be separated from the other proteins in solution and later eluted back into clean solution.

When the tags are not needed anymore, they can be cleaved off by a protease. This often involves engineering a [[protease]] cleavage site between the tag and the protein.

Note, that self-cleaving tag eliminates a need of using proteases to separate tag from target protein of interest during purification process (''e.g.'' ''i''CapTag™).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Merideth A. |last2=Taris |first2=Joseph E. |last3=Shi |first3=Changhua |last4=Wood |first4=David W. |date=2018 |title=A Convenient Split‐Intein Tag Method for the Purification of Tagless Target Proteins |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.46 |journal=Current Protocols in Protein Science |language=en |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=5.29.1–5.29.23 |doi=10.1002/cpps.46 |pmid=29516483 |s2cid=3749506 |issn=1934-3655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Prabhala |first1=Sai Vivek |last2=Gierach |first2=Izabela |last3=Wood |first3=David W. |date=2022 |title=The Evolution of Intein-Based Affinity Methods as Reflected in 30 years of Patent History |url=https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmolb.2022.857566 |journal=Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences |volume=9 |page=857566 |doi=10.3389/fmolb.2022.857566 |doi-broken-date=2022-09-23 |pmid=35463948 |pmc=9033041 |issn=2296-889X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main component of the tag is an intein, which cleaves off simply after pH change. Tagless and pure target protein is then released into the elution buffer.

=== HPLC ===
{{main|High performance liquid chromatography}}
High performance liquid chromatography or high pressure liquid chromatography is a form of chromatography applying high pressure to drive the solutes through the column faster. This means that the diffusion is limited and the resolution is improved. The most common form is "reversed phase" HPLC, where the column material is [[hydrophobicity|hydrophobic]]. The proteins are eluted by a [[gradient]] of increasing amounts of an [[organic solvent]], such as acetonitrile. The proteins elute according to their hydrophobicity. After purification by HPLC the protein is in a solution that only contains [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] compounds, and can easily be lyophilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Regnier FE | title = High-performance liquid chromatography of biopolymers | journal = Science | volume = 222 | issue = 4621 | pages = 245–52 | date = October 1983 | pmid = 6353575 | doi = 10.1126/science.6353575 | bibcode = 1983Sci...222..245R }}&lt;/ref&gt; HPLC purification frequently results in denaturation of the purified proteins and is thus not applicable to proteins that do not spontaneously refold.

== Concentration of the purified protein ==
[[Image:ultra filtration.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A selectively permeable membrane can be mounted in a centrifuge tube. The buffer is forced through the membrane by centrifugation, leaving the protein in the upper chamber.]]
At the end of a protein purification, the protein often has to be concentrated. Different methods exist.

=== Lyophilization ===
If the solution doesn't contain any other soluble component than the protein in question the protein can be [[lyophilization|lyophilized]] (dried). This is commonly done after an HPLC run. This simply removes all volatile components, leaving the proteins behind.

===Ultrafiltration===
[[Ultrafiltration]] concentrates a protein solution using selective permeable membranes. The function of the membrane is to let the water and small molecules pass through while retaining the protein. The solution is forced against the membrane by mechanical pump, gas pressure, or centrifugation.

== Evaluating purification yield ==
The most general method to monitor the purification process is by running a [[SDS-PAGE]] of the different steps. This method only gives a rough measure of the amounts of different proteins in the mixture, and it is not able to distinguish between proteins with similar apparent [[molecular weight]].

If the protein has a distinguishing [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] feature or an [[Enzyme|enzymatic activity]], this property can be used to detect and quantify the specific protein, and thus to select the fractions of the separation, that contains the protein. If antibodies against the protein are available then [[western blotting]] and [[ELISA]] can specifically detect and quantify the amount of desired protein. Some proteins function as [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s and can be detected during purification steps by a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand binding]] assay, often using a [[Radioligand|radioactive ligand]].

In order to evaluate the process of multistep purification, the amount of the specific protein has to be compared to the amount of total protein. The latter can be determined by the [[Bradford protein assay|Bradford total protein assay]] or by absorbance of light at 280 [[meter|nm]], however some reagents used during the purification process may interfere with the quantification.  For example, [[imidazole]] (commonly used for purification of polyhistidine-tagged recombinant proteins) is an amino acid analogue and at low concentrations will interfere with the [[Bicinchoninic acid assay|bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay]] for total protein quantification.  Impurities in low-grade imidazole will also absorb at 280&amp;nbsp;nm, resulting in an inaccurate reading of protein concentration from UV absorbance.

Another method to be considered is Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).  SPR can detect binding of label free molecules on the surface of a chip.  If the desired protein is an antibody, binding can be translated directly to the activity of the protein.  One can express the active concentration of the protein as the percent of the total protein.  SPR can be a powerful method for quickly determining protein activity and overall yield.  It is a powerful technology that requires an instrument to perform.

==Analytical==

=== Denaturing-condition electrophoresis ===

[[Gel electrophoresis]] is a common laboratory technique that can be used both as preparative and analytical method. The principle of [[electrophoresis]] relies on the movement of a charged ion in an electric field. In practice, the proteins are denatured in a solution containing a detergent ([[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]]). In these conditions, the proteins are unfolded and coated with negatively charged detergent molecules. The proteins in [[SDS-PAGE]] are separated on the sole basis of their size.

In analytical methods, the protein migrate as bands based on size. Each band can be detected using stains such as [[Coomassie brilliant blue|Coomassie]] blue dye or [[Staining (biology)#Silver staining|silver stain]]. Preparative methods to purify large amounts of protein, require the extraction of the protein from the electrophoretic gel. This extraction may involve excision of the gel containing a band, or eluting the band directly off the gel as it runs off the end of the gel.

In the context of a purification strategy, denaturing condition electrophoresis provides an improved resolution over size exclusion chromatography, but does not scale to large quantity of proteins in a sample as well as the late [[Chromatography#Column chromatography|chromatography columns]].

=== Non-denaturing-condition electrophoresis ===

[[File:Electrphoresis Tools.TIF|thumb|255px|Equipment for preparative gel electrophoresis: electrophoresis chamber, peristaltic pump, fraction collector, buffer recirculation pump and UV detector (in a refrigerator), power supply and recorder (on a table)]]A non-denaturing electrophoretic procedure for isolating bioactive [[metalloproteins]] in complex protein mixtures is preparative native PAGE. The intactness or the [[chemical structure|structural]] integrity of the isolated protein has to be confirmed by an independent method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Analytical Letters |year=2004 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=657–665 |title=Preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PNC‐PAGE): an efficient method for isolating cadmium cofactors in biological systems |author=Kastenholz B |doi=10.1081/AL-120029742|s2cid=97636537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1dfj RNAseInhibitor-RNAse complex.jpg|thumb|The horseshoe shaped ribonuclease inhibitor (shown as wireframe) forms a protein–protein interaction with the ribonuclease protein. The contacts between the two proteins are shown as coloured patches.]]
'''Protein–protein interactions''' ('''PPIs''') are physical contacts of high specificity established between two or more [[protein]] molecules as a result of biochemical events steered by interactions that include [[electrostatic forces]], [[hydrogen bond]]ing and the [[hydrophobic effect]]. Many are physical contacts with molecular associations between chains that occur in a cell or in a living organism in a specific biomolecular context.

Proteins rarely act alone as their functions tend to be regulated. Many molecular processes within a cell are carried out by [[molecular machine]]s that are built from numerous protein components organized by their PPIs. These physiological interactions make up the so-called [[Interactome|interactomics]] of the organism, while aberrant PPIs are the basis of multiple aggregation-related diseases, such as [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|Creutzfeldt–Jakob]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]s.

PPIs have been studied with [[Methods to investigate protein–protein interactions|many methods]] and from different perspectives: [[biochemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[molecular dynamics]], [[signal transduction]], among others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Titeca|first1=Kevin|last2=Lemmens|first2=Irma|last3=Tavernier|first3=Jan|last4=Eyckerman|first4=Sven|date=2018-06-29|title=Discovering cellular protein‐protein interactions: Technological strategies and opportunities|journal=Mass Spectrometry Reviews|volume=38|issue=1|pages=79–111|doi=10.1002/mas.21574|pmid=29957823|issn=0277-7037|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Herce HD, Deng W, Helma J, Leonhardt H, Cardoso MC|title=Visualization and targeted disruption of protein interactions in living cells|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|page=2660|year=2013|pmid=24154492|pmc=3826628|doi=10.1038/ncomms3660|bibcode=2013NatCo...4.2660H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Isa |first=Nur Firdaus |last2=Bensaude |first2=Olivier |last3=Murphy |first3=Shona |date=2022-02-05 |title=Amber Suppression Technology for Mapping Site-specific Viral-host Protein Interactions in Mammalian Cells |url=https://bio-protocol.org/e4315 |journal=Bio-protocol |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=e4315–e4315 |doi=10.21769/bioprotoc.4315 |pmc=8855090 |pmid=35284605}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this information enables the creation of large protein interaction networks&lt;ref name="Mashaghi, A. 2004 113–121"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mashaghi, A. |title= Investigation of a protein complex network |journal= European Physical Journal |year= 2004  |volume= 41 |issue= 1 |pages= 113–121 |doi=10.1140/epjb/e2004-00301-0|display-authors=etal|arxiv= cond-mat/0304207|bibcode= 2004EPJB...41..113M|s2cid= 9233932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – similar to [[Metabolic network|metabolic]] or [[Genetic networks|genetic/epigenetic networks]] – that empower the current knowledge on [[biochemical cascade]]s and molecular etiology of disease, as well as the discovery of putative protein targets of therapeutic interest.

== Examples ==
===[[Electron transfer protein]]s===
In many metabolic reactions, a protein that acts as an electron carrier binds to an enzyme that acts its [[reductase]]. After it receives an electron, it dissociates and then binds to the next enzyme that acts its [[oxidase]] (i.e. an acceptor of the electron). These interactions between proteins are dependent on highly specific binding between proteins to ensure efficient electron transfer. Examples: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain system components cytochrome c-reductase / [[cytochrome c]] / cytochrome c oxidase; microsomal and mitochondrial P450 systems.&lt;ref name="1996-Hanukoglu"&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Hanukoglu I|title=Physiological Functions of Cytochrome P450 in Relation to Structure and Regulation|chapter=Electron transfer proteins of cytochrome P450 systems|journal=Adv.

In the case of the mitochondrial P450 systems, the specific residues involved in the binding of the electron transfer protein [[adrenodoxin]] to its reductase were identified as two basic Arg residues on the surface of the reductase and two acidic Asp residues on the adrenodoxin.&lt;ref name="pmid8349601"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt ME, Vickery LE | title = Charge pair interactions stabilizing ferredoxin-ferredoxin reductase complexes.

===[[Signal transduction]]===
The activity of the cell is regulated by extracellular signals. Signal propagation inside and/or along the interior of cells depends on PPIs between the various signaling molecules. The recruitment of signaling pathways through PPIs is called [[signal transduction]] and plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and in many diseases including [[Parkinson's disease]] and cancer.

===[[Membrane transport]]===
A protein may be carrying another protein (for example, from [[cytoplasm]] to [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] or vice versa in the case of the [[nuclear pore]] importins).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===[[Cell metabolism]]===
In many biosynthetic processes [[enzymes]] interact with each other to produce small compounds or other macromolecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===[[Muscle contraction]]===
Physiology of [[muscle contraction]] involves several interactions. [[Myosin]] filaments act as [[molecular motor]]s and by binding to [[actin]] enables filament sliding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=G.M.|name-list-style=vanc|title=The cell : a molecular approach|year=2000|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-0-87893-106-4|edition=2nd|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cell00geof}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, members of the [[skeletal muscle]] [[lipid droplet-associated protein]]s family associate with other proteins, as activator of [[adipose triglyceride lipase]] and its [[coactivator]] comparative gene identification-58, to regulate [[lipolysis]] in skeletal muscle

== Types ==
{{Main|Multiprotein complex}}
To describe the types of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) it is important to consider that proteins can interact in a "transient" way (to produce some specific effect in a short time, like a signal transduction) or to interact with other proteins in a "stable" way to form complexes that become molecular machines within the living systems. A protein complex assembly can result in the formation of [[Oligomer|homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric complexes]]. In addition to the conventional complexes, as enzyme-inhibitor and antibody-antigen, interactions can also be established between domain-domain and domain-peptide. Another important distinction to identify protein-protein interactions is the way they have been determined, since there are techniques that measure direct physical interactions between protein pairs, named “binary” methods, while there are other techniques that measure physical interactions among groups of proteins, without pairwise determination of protein partners, named “co-complex” methods.

=== Homo-oligomers vs. hetero-oligomers ===
Homo-oligomers are macromolecular complexes constituted by only one type of [[protein subunit]]. Protein subunits assembly is guided by the establishment of [[non-covalent interactions]] in the [[quaternary structure]] of the protein. Disruption of homo-oligomers in order to return to the initial individual [[monomers]] often requires denaturation of the complex.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Several [[enzymes]], [[carrier proteins]], scaffolding proteins, and transcriptional regulatory factors carry out their functions as homo-oligomers. 
Distinct protein subunits interact in hetero-oligomers, which are essential to control several cellular functions. The importance of the communication between heterologous proteins is even more evident during cell signaling events and such interactions are only possible due to structural domains within the proteins (as described below).

=== Stable interactions vs. transient interactions ===
Stable interactions involve proteins that interact for a long time, taking part of permanent complexes as subunits, in order to carry out functional roles. These are usually the case of homo-oligomers (e.g. [[cytochrome c]]), and some hetero-oligomeric proteins, as the subunits of [[ATPase]]. On the other hand, a protein may interact briefly and in a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] manner with other proteins in only certain cellular contexts – [[cell type]], [[Cell cycle|cell cycle stage]], external factors, presence of other binding proteins, etc. – as it happens with most of the proteins involved in [[biochemical cascade]]s. These are called transient interactions. For example, some G protein-coupled receptors only transiently bind to G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; proteins when they are activated by extracellular ligands,&lt;ref name="pmid=18434433"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Qin K, Sethi PR, Lambert NA|title=Abundance and stability of complexes containing inactive G protein-coupled receptors and G proteins|journal=FASEB Journal|volume=22|issue=8|pages=2920–7|date=August 2008|pmid=18434433|pmc=2493464|doi=10.1096/fj.08-105775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while some G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled receptors, such as muscarinic receptor M3, pre-couple with G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; proteins prior to the receptor-ligand binding.&lt;ref name="pmid=21873996"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Qin K, Dong C, Wu G, Lambert NA|title=Inactive-state preassembly of G(q)-coupled receptors and G(q) heterotrimers|journal=Nature Chemical Biology|volume=7|issue=10|pages=740–7|date=August 2011|pmid=21873996|pmc=3177959|doi=10.1038/nchembio.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between intrinsically disordered protein regions to globular protein domains (i.e. [[MoRFs]]) are transient interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Malhis N, Gsponer J|title=Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=31|issue=11|pages=1738–44|date=June 2015|pmid=25637562|pmc=4443681|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btv060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covalent vs. non-covalent===
{{Main|Covalent bond|Non-covalent interactions}}
Covalent interactions are those with the strongest association and are formed by [[disulphide bonds]] or [[Atomic orbital|electron sharing]]. While rare, these interactions are determinant in some [[posttranslational modifications]], as [[ubiquitination]] and [[SUMOylation]]. Non-covalent bonds are usually established during transient interactions by the combination of weaker bonds, such as [[hydrogen bonds]], ionic interactions, [[Van der Waals force]]s, or hydrophobic bonds.&lt;ref name="Jukka" /&gt;

===Role of water===
Water molecules play a significant role in the interactions between proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Janin J|title=Wet and dry interfaces: the role of solvent in protein-protein and protein-DNA recognition|journal=Structure|volume=7|issue=12|pages=R277–9|date=December 1999|pmid=10647173|doi=10.1016/s0969-2126(00)88333-1 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Barillari C, Taylor J, Viner R, Essex JW|title=Classification of water molecules in protein binding sites|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=9|pages=2577–87|date=March 2007|pmid=17288418|doi=10.1021/ja066980q }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal structures of complexes, obtained at high resolution from different but homologous proteins, have shown that some interface water molecules are conserved between homologous complexes. The majority of the interface water molecules make hydrogen bonds with both partners of each complex. Some interface amino acid residues or atomic groups of one protein partner engage in both direct and water mediated interactions with the other protein partner. Doubly indirect interactions, mediated by two water molecules, are more numerous in the homologous complexes of low affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lisova O, Belkadi L, Bedouelle H|title=Direct and indirect interactions in the recognition between a cross-neutralizing antibody and the four serotypes of dengue virus|journal=Journal of Molecular Recognition|volume=27|issue=4|pages=205–14|date=April 2014|pmid=24591178|doi=10.1002/jmr.2352 |s2cid=5416842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carefully conducted mutagenesis experiments, e.g. changing a tyrosine residue into a phenylalanine, have shown that water mediated interactions can contribute to the energy of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=England P, Brégégère F, Bedouelle H|title=Energetic and kinetic contributions of contact residues of antibody D1.3 in the interaction with lysozyme|journal=Biochemistry|volume=36|issue=1|pages=164–72|date=January 1997|pmid=8993330|doi=10.1021/bi961419y|citeseerx=10.1.1.613.413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, water molecules may facilitate the interactions and cross-recognitions between proteins.

Later, [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] also started to be applied with the aim of unravelling the molecular structure of protein complexes. One of the first examples was the structure of calmodulin-binding domains bound to [[calmodulin]].&lt;ref name="Alberts" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NMR&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wand AJ, Englander SW|title=Protein complexes studied by NMR spectroscopy|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=7|issue=4|pages=403–8|date=August 1996|pmid=8768898|pmc=3442359|doi=10.1016/s0958-1669(96)80115-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is based on the study of magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, thus determining physical and chemical properties of the correspondent atoms or the molecules.

=== Domains ===
Proteins hold structural domains that allow their interaction with and bind to specific sequences on other proteins:

* ''Src homology 2 (SH2) domain '' {{Main|SH2 domain}} 
:SH2 domains are structurally composed by three-stranded twisted beta sheet sandwiched flanked by two alpha-helices. The existence of a deep binding pocket with high affinity for [[phosphotyrosine]], but not for [[phosphoserine]] or [[phosphothreonine]], is essential for the recognition of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, mainly autophosphorylated [[growth factor]] receptors. Growth factor receptor binding proteins and [[phospholipase C]]γ are examples of proteins that have SH2 domains.&lt;ref name=Berridge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berridge|first=M.J.|title=Cell Signalling Biology: Module 6 – Spatial and Temporal Aspects of Signalling|journal=Biochemical Journal|volume=6|pages=csb0001006|year=2012|doi=10.1042/csb0001006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Src homology 3 (SH3) domain '' {{Main|SH3 domain}}
:Structurally, SH3 domains are constituted by a beta barrel formed by two orthogonal beta sheets and three anti-parallel beta strands. These domains recognize [[proline]] enriched sequences, as polyproline type II helical structure (PXXP motifs){{Verify source|date=August 2014}} in cell signaling proteins like protein [[tyrosine kinases]] and the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 ([[Grb2]]).&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

* ''Phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain '' {{Main|PTB domain}}
:PTB domains interact with sequences that contain a phosphotyrosine group. These domains can be found in the [[insulin receptor substrate]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

* ''LIM domain '' {{Main|LIM domain}}
:LIM domains were initially identified in three [[homeodomain transcription factors]] (lin11, is11, and mec3). In addition to this [[homeodomain proteins]] and other proteins involved in development, LIM domains have also been identified in non-homeodomain proteins with relevant roles in [[cellular differentiation]], association with [[cytoskeleton]] and [[senescence]]. These domains contain a tandem cysteine-rich [[Zn-finger|Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-finger motif]] and embrace the [[consensus sequence]] CX2CX16-23HX2CX2CX2CX16-21CX2C/H/D. LIM domains bind to PDZ domains, bHLH transcription factors, and other LIM domains.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
* ''Sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain '' {{Main|SAM domain}}
:SAM domains are composed by five helices forming a compact package with a conserved [[hydrophobic core]]. These domains, which can be found in the [[Eph receptor]] and the stromal interaction molecule ([[STIM]]) for example, bind to non-SAM domain-containing proteins and they also appear to have the ability to bind [[RNA]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
* ''PDZ domain '' {{Main|PDZ domain}}
:PDZ domains were first identified in three guanylate kinases: PSD-95, DlgA and ZO-1. These domains recognize carboxy-terminal tri-peptide motifs (S/TXV), other [[PDZ domain]]s or [[LIM domain]]s and bind them through a short peptide sequence that has a [[C-terminal]] hydrophobic residue. Some of the proteins identified as having PDZ domains are scaffolding proteins or seem to be involved in ion receptor assembling and receptor-enzyme complexes formation.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
* ''FERM domain '' {{Main|FERM domain}}
:FERM domains contain basic residues capable of binding [[Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate|PtdIns(4,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Talin protein|Talin]] and [[focal adhesion kinase]] (FAK) are two of the proteins that present FERM domains.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
* ''Calponin homology (CH) domain '' {{Main|Calponin homology domain}}
:CH domains are mainly present in cytoskeletal proteins as [[PARVA|parvin]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
* ''Pleckstrin homology domain '' {{Main|Pleckstrin homology domain}}
:Pleckstrin homology domains bind to phosphoinositides and acid domains in signaling proteins.
* ''WW domain '' {{Main|WW domain}}
:WW domains bind to proline enriched sequences.
* ''WSxWS motif '' 
:Found in cytokine receptors

==Properties of the interface==
The study of the molecular structure can give fine details about the interface that enables the interaction between proteins. When characterizing PPI interfaces it is important to take into account the type of complex.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jones S, Thornton JM|title=Principles of protein-protein interactions|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=93|issue=1|pages=13–20|date=January 1996|pmid=8552589|pmc=40170|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.1.13|bibcode=1996PNAS...93...13J |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parameters evaluated include size (measured in absolute dimensions [[Angstrom|Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] or in [[Solvent accessible surface area|solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)]]), shape, complementarity between surfaces, residue interface propensities, hydrophobicity, segmentation and secondary structure, and conformational changes on complex formation.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

The great majority of PPI interfaces reflects the composition of protein surfaces, rather than the protein cores, in spite of being frequently enriched in hydrophobic residues, particularly in aromatic residues.&lt;ref name=Yan&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yan C, Wu F, Jernigan RL, Dobbs D, Honavar V|title=Characterization of protein-protein interfaces|journal=The Protein Journal|volume=27|issue=1|pages=59–70|date=January 2008|pmid=17851740|pmc=2566606|doi=10.1007/s10930-007-9108-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; PPI interfaces are dynamic and frequently planar, although they can be globular and protruding as well.&lt;ref name=JonesJMB&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jones S, Thornton JM|title=Analysis of protein-protein interaction sites using surface patches|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=272|issue=1|pages=121–32|date=September 1997|pmid=9299342|doi=10.1006/jmbi.1997.1234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on three structures – [[insulin]] dimer, [[trypsin]]-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex, and [[oxyhaemoglobin]] – [[Cyrus Chothia]] and Joel Janin found that between 1,130 and 1,720 Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of surface area was removed from contact with water indicating that hydrophobicity is a major factor of stabilization of PPIs.&lt;ref name="pmid1153006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chothia C, Janin J|title=Principles of protein-protein recognition|journal=Nature|volume=256|issue=5520|pages=705–8|date=August 1975|pmid=1153006|doi=10.1038/256705a0|bibcode=1975Natur.256..705C |s2cid=4292325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies refined the buried surface area of the majority of interactions to 1,600±350 Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, much larger interaction interfaces were also observed and were associated with [[Conformational change|significant changes in conformation]] of one of the interaction partners.&lt;ref name="pmid2204619" /&gt; PPIs interfaces exhibit both shape and electrostatic complementarity.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid=21873996" /&gt;

== Regulation ==
* Protein concentration, which in turn are affected by expression levels and degradation rates; 
* Protein affinity for proteins or other binding ligands;
* Ligands concentrations ([[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]], [[ions]], etc.); 
* Presence of other [[proteins]], [[nucleic acids]], and [[ions]];
* [[Electric field]]s around proteins. 
* Occurrence of covalent modifications;

The Y2H is based on the functional reconstitution of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and subsequent activation of a selective reporter such as His3. To test two proteins for interaction, two protein expression constructs are made: one protein (X) is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DB) and a second protein (Y) is fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD). In the assay, yeast cells are transformed with these constructs. Transcription of reporter genes does not occur unless bait (DB-X) and prey (AD-Y) interact with each other and form a functional Gal4 transcription factor. Thus, the interaction between proteins can be inferred by the presence of the products resultant of the reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=Jukka&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Westermarck J, Ivaska J, Corthals GL|title=Identification of protein interactions involved in cellular signaling|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1752–63|date=July 2013|pmid=23481661|pmc=3708163|doi=10.1074/mcp.R113.027771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wodak&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wodak SJ, Vlasblom J, Turinsky AL, Pu S|title=Protein-protein interaction networks: the puzzling riches|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=23|issue=6|pages=941–53|date=December 2013|pmid=24007795|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2013.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases in which the reporter gene expresses enzymes that allow the yeast to synthesize essential amino acids or nucleotides, yeast growth under selective media conditions indicates that the two proteins tested are interacting.

Despite its usefulness, the yeast two-hybrid system has limitations. It uses yeast as main host system, which can be a problem when studying proteins that contain mammalian-specific post-translational modifications. The number of PPIs identified is usually low because of a high false negative rate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rajagopala SV, Sikorski P, Caufield JH, Tovchigrechko A, Uetz P|title=Studying protein complexes by the yeast two-hybrid system|journal=Methods|volume=58|issue=4|pages=392–9|date=December 2012|pmid=22841565|pmc=3517932|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.07.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, understates [[membrane proteins]], for example.&lt;ref name=Stelzl&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stelzl U, Wanker EE|title=The value of high quality protein-protein interaction networks for systems biology|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|volume=10|issue=6|pages=551–8|date=December 2006|pmid=17055769|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pets&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Petschnigg J, Snider J, Stagljar I|title=Interactive proteomics research technologies: recent applications and advances|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=50–8|date=February 2011|pmid=20884196|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In initial studies that utilized Y2H, proper controls for false positives (e.g. when DB-X activates the reporter gene without the presence of AD-Y) were frequently not done, leading to a higher than normal false positive rate.

===Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry===
{{Main|Mass spectrometry}}
Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry mostly detects stable interactions and thus better indicates functional in vivo PPIs.&lt;ref name="pmid23017156|noedit"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brettner LM, Masel J|title=Protein stickiness, rather than number of functional protein-protein interactions, predicts expression noise and plasticity in yeast|journal=BMC Systems Biology|volume=6|page=128|date=September 2012|pmid=23017156|pmc=3527306|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wodak" /&gt; This method starts by purification of the tagged protein, which is expressed in the cell usually at ''in vivo'' concentrations, and its interacting proteins (affinity purification). One of the most advantageous and widely used methods to purify proteins with very low contaminating background is the [[tandem affinity purification]], developed by Bertrand Seraphin and Matthias Mann and respective colleagues. PPIs can then be quantitatively and qualitatively analysed by mass spectrometry using different methods: chemical incorporation, biological or metabolic incorporation (SILAC), and label-free methods.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Furthermore, [[network theory]] has been used to study the whole set of identified protein-protein interactions in cells.&lt;ref name="Mashaghi, A. 2004 113–121"/&gt;

===Nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA)===
This system was first developed by LaBaer and colleagues in 2004 by using in vitro transcription and translation system. They use DNA template encoding the gene of interest fused with GST protein, and it was immobilized in the solid surface. Anti-GST antibody and biotinylated plasmid DNA were bounded in aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-coated slide. BSA can improve the binding efficiency of DNA. Biotinylated plasmid DNA was bound by avidin. New protein was synthesized by using cell-free expression system i.e. rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), and then the new protein was captured through anti-GST antibody bounded on the slide. To test protein-protein interaction, the targeted protein cDNA and query protein cDNA were immobilized in a same coated slide. By using in vitro transcription and translation system, targeted and query protein was synthesized by the same extract. The targeted protein was bound to array by antibody coated in the slide and query protein was used to probe the array. The query protein was tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Thus, the interaction between the two proteins was visualized with the antibody against HA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ramachandran N, Hainsworth E, Bhullar B, Eisenstein S, Rosen B, Lau AY, Walter JC, LaBaer J|title=Self-assembling protein microarrays|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5680|pages=86–90|date=July 2004|pmid=15232106|doi=10.1126/science.1097639 |bibcode=2004Sci...305...86R|s2cid=20936301|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0069e9285f277056500448265d34b03a44372a08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ramachandran N, Raphael JV, Hainsworth E, Demirkan G, Fuentes MG, Rolfs A, Hu Y, LaBaer J|title=Next-generation high-density self-assembling functional protein arrays|language=En|journal=Nature Methods|volume=5|issue=6|pages=535–8|date=June 2008|pmid=18469824|pmc=3070491|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intragenic complementation===

When multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a [[gene]] form a complex, this protein structure is referred to as a multimer.  When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different [[mutant]] [[allele]]s of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone.  In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as [[complementation (genetics)|intragenic complementation]] (also called inter-allelic complementation).  Intragenic complementation has been demonstrated in many different genes in a variety of organisms including the fungi ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''; the bacterium ''[[Salmonella]] typhimurium''; the virus [[Escherichia virus T4|bacteriophage T4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=H |last2=Edgar |first2=RS |last3=Denhardt |first3=GH |title=Intragenic Complementation among Temperature Sensitive Mutants of Bacteriophage T4D |journal=Genetics |date=June 1965 |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=987–1002 |doi=10.1093/genetics/51.6.987 |pmid=14337770 |pmc=1210828}}&lt;/ref&gt; an RNA virus&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood S, Cevik B, Moyer SA.

Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005;1740(3):489-498. {{doi|10.1016/j.bbadis.2004.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In such studies, numerous [[mutation]]s defective in the same gene were often isolated and mapped in a linear order on the basis of [[genetic recombination|recombination]] frequencies to form a [[gene mapping|genetic map]] of the gene.  Separately, the mutants were tested in pairwise combinations to measure complementation.  An analysis of the results from such studies led to the conclusion that intragenic complementation, in general, arises from the interaction of differently defective polypeptide monomers to form a multimer.&lt;ref&gt;Crick FH, Orgel LE.  The theory of inter-allelic complementation. J Mol Biol. 1964 Jan;8:161-5. {{doi|10.1016/s0022-2836(64)80156-x}}. PMID 14149958&lt;/ref&gt;  Genes that encode multimer-forming polypeptides appear to be common.  One interpretation of the data is that polypeptide monomers are often aligned in the multimer in such a way that mutant polypeptides defective at nearby sites in the genetic map tend to form a mixed multimer that functions poorly, whereas mutant polypeptides defective at distant sites tend to form a mixed multimer that functions more effectively.  Direct interaction of two nascent proteins emerging from nearby [[ribosome]]s appears to be a general mechanism for homo-oligomer (multimer) formation.&lt;ref name = Bertolini2021&gt;Bertolini M, Fenzl K, Kats I, Wruck F, Tippmann F, Schmitt J, Auburger JJ, Tans S, Bukau B, Kramer G.

PMID 33384371&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of protein oligomers were identified that assemble in human cells by such an interaction.&lt;ref name = Bertolini2021/&gt;  The most prevalent form of interaction is between the N-terminal regions of the interacting proteins.  Dimer formation appears to be able to occur independently of dedicated assembly machines.  The intermolecular forces likely responsible for self-recognition and multimer formation were discussed by Jehle.&lt;ref&gt;Jehle H. Intermolecular forces and biological specificity.

===Other potential methods===
Diverse techniques to identify PPIs have been emerging along with technology progression. These include co-immunoprecipitation, [[Microarrays|protein microarrays]], [[analytical ultracentrifugation]], [[light scattering]], [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping (LUMIER), resonance-energy transfer systems, mammalian protein–protein interaction trap, [[electro-switchable biosurfaces]], [[protein-fragment complementation assay]], as well as real-time label-free measurements by [[surface plasmon resonance]], and [[calorimetry]].&lt;ref name="Stelzl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pets" /&gt;

== Computational methods ==
[[File:Text mining protocol.png|thumb|[[Text mining]] protocol.]]

===[[Protein-protein interaction prediction|Computational Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions]]===
The experimental detection and characterization of PPIs is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, many PPIs can be also predicted computationally, usually using experimental data as a starting point. However, methods have also been developed that allow the prediction of PPI de novo, that is without prior evidence for these interactions.

==== Genomic Context Methods ====
''[[Protein–protein interaction prediction|The Rosetta Stone or Domain Fusion method]]'' is based on the hypothesis that interacting proteins are sometimes fused into a single protein in another genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=David|last2=Yeates|first2=Todd O.|last3=Rice|first3=Danny W.|last4=Ng|first4=Ho-Leung|last5=Pellegrini|first5=Matteo|last6=Marcotte|first6=Edward M.|date=1999-07-30|title=Detecting Protein Function and Protein-Protein Interactions from Genome Sequences|journal=Science|language=en|volume=285|issue=5428|pages=751–753|doi=10.1126/science.285.5428.751|issn=1095-9203|pmid=10427000|citeseerx=10.1.1.535.9650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, we can predict if two proteins may be interacting by determining if they each have non-overlapping sequence similarity to a region of a single protein sequence in another genome.

''[[Protein-protein interaction prediction|The Conserved Neighborhood method]]'' is based on the hypothesis that if genes encoding two proteins are neighbors on a chromosome in many genomes, then they are likely functionally related (and possibly physically interacting)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raman|first=Karthik|date=2010-02-15|title=Construction and analysis of protein–protein interaction networks|journal=Automated Experimentation|volume=2|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1186/1759-4499-2-2|issn=1759-4499|pmc=2834675|pmid=20334628}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

''[[Protein-protein interaction prediction|The Phylogenetic Profile method]]'' is based on the hypothesis that if two or more proteins are concurrently present or absent across several genomes, then they are likely functionally related.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, potentially interacting proteins can be identified by determining the presence or absence of genes across many genomes and selecting those genes which are always present or absent together.

===Text mining methods===
{{Further|text mining}}Publicly available information from biomedical documents is readily accessible through the internet and is becoming a powerful resource for collecting known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), PPI prediction and protein docking. Text mining is much less costly and time-consuming compared to other high-throughput techniques. Currently, text mining methods generally detect [[binary relation]]s between interacting proteins from individual sentences using rule/pattern-based information extraction and [[machine learning]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Badal VD, Kundrotas PJ, Vakser IA|title=Text Mining for Protein Docking|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=11|issue=12|pages=e1004630|date=December 2015|pmid=26650466|pmc=4674139|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004630|bibcode=2015PLSCB..11E4630B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of text mining applications for PPI extraction and/or prediction are available for public use, as well as repositories which often store manually validated and/or computationally predicted PPIs. Text mining can be implemented in two stages: ''information retrieval'', where texts containing names of either or both interacting proteins are retrieved and ''information extraction,'' where targeted information (interacting proteins, implicated residues, interaction types, etc.) is extracted.

There are also studies using [[phylogenetic profiling]], basing their functionalities on the theory that proteins involved in common pathways co-evolve in a correlated fashion across species. Some more complex text mining methodologies use advanced [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) techniques and build knowledge networks (for example, considering gene names as nodes and verbs as edges). Other developments involve [[kernel method]]s to predict protein interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Papanikolaou N, Pavlopoulos GA, Theodosiou T, Iliopoulos I|title=Protein-protein interaction predictions using text mining methods|journal=Methods|volume=74|pages=47–53|date=March 2015|pmid=25448298|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.10.026|series=Text mining of biomedical literature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, integral membrane proteins of [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] were analyzed using the mating-based ubiquitin system (mbSUS).

In 2006, [[random forest]], an example of a supervised technique, was found to be the most-effective machine learning method for protein interaction prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Qi Y, Bar-Joseph Z, Klein-Seetharaman J|title=Evaluation of different biological data and computational classification methods for use in protein interaction prediction|journal=Proteins|volume=63|issue=3|pages=490–500|date=May 2006|pmid=16450363|pmc=3250929|doi=10.1002/prot.20865 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods have been applied for discovering protein interactions on human interactome, specifically the interactome of [[Membrane proteins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Qi Y, Dhiman HK, Bhola N, Budyak I, Kar S, Man D, Dutta A, Tirupula K, Carr BI, Grandis J, Bar-Joseph Z, Klein-Seetharaman J|title=Systematic prediction of human membrane receptor interactions|journal=Proteomics|volume=9|issue=23|pages=5243–55|date=December 2009|pmid=19798668|pmc=3076061|doi=10.1002/pmic.200900259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the interactome of Schizophrenia-associated proteins.&lt;ref name="mkgnpjS"/&gt;

== Databases ==
Large scale identification of PPIs generated hundreds of thousands of interactions, which were collected together in specialized [[biological databases]] that are continuously updated in order to provide complete [[interactomes]]. The first of these databases was the [[Database of Interacting Proteins|Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)]].&lt;ref name="pmid10592249"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Xenarios I, Rice DW, Salwinski L, Baron MK, Marcotte EM, Eisenberg D|title=DIP: the database of interacting proteins|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=28|issue=1|pages=289–91|date=January 2000|pmid=10592249|pmc=102387|doi=10.1093/nar/28.1.289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Primary databases'' collect information about published PPIs proven to exist via small-scale or large-scale experimental methods. Examples: [[Database of Interacting Proteins|DIP]], [[Biomolecular Interaction Network Database]] (BIND), Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets ([[BioGRID]]), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), IntAct Molecular Interaction Database, Molecular Interactions Database (MINT), MIPS Protein Interaction Resource on Yeast (MIPS-MPact), and MIPS Mammalian Protein–Protein Interaction Database (MIPS-MPPI).&lt;

''Meta-databases'' normally result from the integration of primary databases information, but can also collect some original data.

''Prediction databases'' include many PPIs that are predicted using several techniques (main article). Examples: Human Protein–Protein Interaction Prediction Database (PIPs),&lt;ref name="McDowallScott2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McDowall MD, Scott MS, Barton GJ|title=PIPs: human protein-protein interaction prediction database|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=37|issue=Database issue|pages=D651–6|date=January 2009|pmid=18988626|pmc=2686497|doi=10.1093/nar/gkn870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlogous Interaction Database (I2D), [[STRING|Known and Predicted Protein–Protein Interactions (STRING-db)]], and Unified Human Interactive (UniHI).

The aforementioned computational methods all depend on source databases whose data can be extrapolated to predict novel protein-protein interactions''. Coverage'' differs greatly between databases. In general, primary databases have the fewest total protein interactions recorded as they do not integrate data from multiple other databases, while prediction databases have the most because they include other forms of evidence in addition to experimental. For example, the primary database IntAct has 572,063 interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=IntAct|date=|title=Proteins, Interactions, Binary interactions and n-ary interactions|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/about/statistics?conversationContext=2|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-11-19|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meta-database APID has 678,000 interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cicblade.dep.usal.es:8080/APID/init.action#tabr4|title=Agile Protein Interactomes DataServer: About APID}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the predictive database STRING has 25,914,693 interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://string-db.org/cgi/about.pl?footer_active_subpage=statistics|title=STRING: functional protein association networks|website=string-db.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that some of the interactions in the STRING database are only predicted by computational methods such as Genomic Context and not experimentally verified.

One example of a manually produced molecular interaction map is the Kurt Kohn's 1999 map of cell cycle control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schwikowski B, Uetz P, Fields S|title=A network of protein-protein interactions in yeast|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=18|issue=12|pages=1257–61|date=December 2000|pmid=11101803|doi=10.1038/82360 |s2cid=3009359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Kohn's map, Schwikowski et al. in 2000 published a paper on PPIs in yeast, linking 1,548 interacting proteins determined by two-hybrid screening. They used a layered graph drawing method to find an initial placement of the nodes and then improved the layout using a force-based algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rigaut G, Shevchenko A, Rutz B, Wilm M, Mann M, Séraphin B|title=A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=17|issue=10|pages=1030–2|date=October 1999|pmid=10504710|doi=10.1038/13732 |s2cid=663553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioinformatic tools have been developed to simplify the difficult task of visualizing molecular interaction networks and complement them with other types of data. For instance, [[Cytoscape]] is an open-source software widely used and many plugins are currently available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kohl|first1=Michael|last2=Wiese|first2=Sebastian|last3=Warscheid|first3=Bettina|year=2011|name-list-style=vanc|chapter=Cytoscape: Software for Visualization and Analysis of Biological Networks|title=Data Mining in Proteomics|journal=&lt;!--Bypass Citation bot --&gt;|doi=10.1007/978-1-60761-987-1_18|pmid=21063955|volume=696|pages=291–303|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-60761-986-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pajek software is advantageous for the visualization and analysis of very large networks.&lt;ref name=Raman&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Raman K|title=Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction networks|journal=Automated Experimentation|volume=2|issue=1|page=2|date=February 2010|pmid=20334628|pmc=2834675|doi=10.1186/1759-4499-2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of functional modules in PPI networks is an important challenge in bioinformatics. Functional modules means a set of proteins that are highly [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] to each other in PPI network. It is almost similar problem as community detection in [[social network]]s. There are some methods such as Jactive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ideker T, Ozier O, Schwikowski B, Siegel AF|title=Discovering regulatory and signalling circuits in molecular interaction networks|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=18 Suppl 1|pages=S233–40|date=2002-01-01|pmid=12169552|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.s233 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; modules and MoBaS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=MOBAS: identification of disease-associated protein subnetworks using modularity-based scoring|journal=EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology|date=2015-06-30|issn=1687-4153|pages=7|volume=2015|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13637-015-0025-6|pmid=28194175|pmc=5270451|first1=Marzieh|last1=Ayati|first2=Sinan|last2=Erten|first3=Mark R.|last3=Chance|first4=Mehmet|last4=Koyutürk|name-list-style=vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jactive modules integrate PPI network and [[gene expression]] data where as MoBaS integrate PPI network and [[Genome-wide association study|Genome Wide association Studies]].

Protein-protein relationships are often the result of multiple types of interactions or are deduced from different approaches, including co-localization, direct interaction, suppressive genetic interaction, additive genetic interaction, physical association, and other associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=De Domenico M, Nicosia V, Arenas A, Latora V|title=Structural reducibility of multilayer networks|journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|page=6864|date=April 2015|pmid=25904309|doi=10.1038/ncomms7864|bibcode=2015NatCo...6.6864D |arxiv=1405.0425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signed interaction networks ===
[[File:Genetic interactions between Ras signalling and chromatin remodelling-A.jpg|thumb|The protein protein interactions are displayed in a signed network that describes what type of interactions that are taking place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fischer B, Sandmann T, Horn T, Billmann M, Chaudhary V, Huber W, Boutros M|title=A map of directional genetic interactions in a metazoan cell|journal=eLife|volume=4|date=March 2015|pmid=25748138|pmc=4384530|doi=10.7554/eLife.05464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Protein–protein interactions often result in one of the interacting proteins either being 'activated' or 'repressed'. Such effects can be indicated in a PPI network by "signs" (e.g. "activation" or "inhibition"). Although such attributes have been added to networks for a long time,&lt;ref&gt;Ideker T., Tan K. &amp; Uetz P. (2005) Visualization and integration of protein-protein interactions. In: Golemis, E. (ed.) Protein-Protein Interactions – A Molecular Cloning Manual, 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Vinayagam et al. (2014) coined the term ''Signed network'' for them. Signed networks are often expressed by labeling the interaction as either positive or negative. A positive interaction is one where the interaction results in one of the proteins being activated. Conversely, a negative interaction indicates that one of the proteins being inactivated.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vinayagam A, Zirin J, Roesel C, Hu Y, Yilmazel B, Samsonova AA, Neumüller RA, Mohr SE, Perrimon N|title=Integrating protein-protein interaction networks with phenotypes reveals signs of interactions|journal=Nature Methods|volume=11|issue=1|pages=94–9|date=January 2014|pmid=24240319|pmc=3877743|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein–protein interaction networks are often constructed as a result of lab experiments such as yeast two-hybrid screens or 'affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen GI, Gingras AC|title=Affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of serine/threonine phosphatases|journal=Methods|volume=42|issue=3|pages=298–305|date=July 2007|pmid=17532517|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2007.02.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However these methods do not provide the layer of information needed in order to determine what type of interaction is present in order to be able to attribute signs to the network diagrams.

==== RNA interference screens ====
[[RNA interference]] (RNAi) screens (repression of individual proteins between transcription and translation) are one method that can be utilized in the process of providing signs to the protein-protein interactions. Individual proteins are repressed and the resulting phenotypes are analyzed. A correlating phenotypic relationship (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in the same phenotype) indicates a positive, or activating relationship. Phenotypes that do not correlate (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in two different phenotypes) indicate a negative or inactivating relationship. If protein A is dependent on protein B for activation then the inhibition of either protein A or B will result in a cell losing the service that is provided by protein A and the phenotypes will be the same for the inhibition of either A or B. If, however, protein A is inactivated by protein B then the phenotypes will differ depending on which protein is inhibited (inhibit protein B and it can no longer inactivate protein A leaving A active however inactivate A and there is nothing for B to activate since A is inactive and the phenotype changes). Multiple [[RNA interference|RNAi]] screens need to be performed in order to reliably appoint a sign to a given protein-protein interaction. Vinayagam et al. who devised this technique state that a minimum of nine [[RNA interference|RNAi]] screens are required with confidence increasing as one carries out more screens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== As therapeutic targets ==
Modulation of PPI is challenging and is receiving increasing attention by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Laraia L, McKenzie G, Spring DR, Venkitaraman AR, Huggins DJ|title=Overcoming Chemical, Biological, and Computational Challenges in the Development of Inhibitors Targeting Protein-Protein Interactions|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|volume=22|issue=6|pages=689–703|date=June 2015|pmid=26091166|pmc=4518475|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2015.04.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several properties of PPI such as allosteric sites and hotspots, have been incorporated into drug-design strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arkin MR, Wells JA|title=Small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions: progressing towards the dream|journal=Nature Reviews.

The consensus among these promising targets is, nonetheless, denoted in the already available drugs on the market to treat a multitude of diseases. Examples are Tirobifan, inhibitor of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, used as a cardiovascular drug, and [[Maraviroc]], inhibitor of the CCR5-gp120 interaction, used as anti-HIV drug.&lt;ref name=Ivanov&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ivanov AA, Khuri FR, Fu H|title=Targeting protein-protein interactions as an anticancer strategy|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|volume=34|issue=7|pages=393–400|date=July 2013|pmid=23725674|pmc=3773978|doi=10.1016/j.tips.2013.04.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''proteolysis targeting chimera''' ('''PROTAC''') is a heterobifunctional small molecule composed of two active domains and a linker, capable of removing specific unwanted proteins. Rather than acting as a conventional [[enzyme inhibitor]], a PROTAC works by inducing selective [[intracellular]] [[proteolysis]]. PROTACs consist of two covalently linked protein-binding molecules: one capable of engaging an [[Ubiquitin ligase|E3 ubiquitin ligase]], and another that binds to a target protein meant for degradation. Recruitment of the E3 ligase to the target protein results in [[ubiquitin]]ation and subsequent degradation of the target protein via the [[proteasome]]. Because PROTACs need only to bind their targets with high selectivity (rather than inhibit the target protein's enzymatic activity), there are currently many efforts to retool previously ineffective inhibitor molecules as PROTACs for next-generation drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cermakova K, Hodges HC | title = Next-Generation Drugs and Probes for Chromatin Biology: From Targeted Protein Degradation to Phase Separation | journal = Molecules | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1958 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30082609 | pmc = 6102721 | doi = 10.3390/molecules23081958 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action==
[[File:Proteolysis targeting chimera mechanism.svg|thumb|upright=2|Mechanism. E1, E2, E3: [[ubiquitin]]ation enzymes; Ub = ubiquitin; target = protein to be degraded&lt;ref name="Ishoey" /&gt;]]
PROTACs achieve degradation through "hijacking" the cell's ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) by bringing together the target protein and an E3 ligase.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bondeson|first1=Daniel P.|last2=Crews|first2=Craig M.|date=2017-01-06|title=Targeted Protein Degradation by Small Molecules|journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology|volume=57|pages=107–123|doi=10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010715-103507|issn=0362-1642|pmc=5586045|pmid=27732798}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First, the E1 ligase activates and conjugates the ubiquitin to the E2 ligase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The E2 ligase then forms a complex with the E3 ligase. The E3 ligase targets proteins and covalently attaches the ubiquitin to the protein of interest.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eventually, after a ubiquitin chain is formed, the protein is recognized and degraded by the [[Proteasome|26S proteasome]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; PROTACs take advantage of this cellular system by putting the protein of interest in close proximity to the E3 ligase to catalyze degradation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Unlike traditional inhibitors, PROTACs have a [[Catalysis|catalytic mechanism]], with the PROTAC itself being recycled after the target protein is degraded.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Melanie|last2=Radoux|first2=Chris J.|last3=Hercules|first3=Andrew|last4=Ochoa|first4=David|last5=Dunham|first5=Ian|last6=Zalmas|first6=Lykourgos-Panagiotis|last7=Hessler|first7=Gerhard|last8=Ruf|first8=Sven|last9=Shanmugasundaram|first9=Veerabahu|last10=Hann|first10=Michael M.|last11=Thomas|first11=Pam J.|date=July 2021|title=The PROTACtable genome|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34285415|journal=Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery|volume=20|issue=10|pages=789–797|doi=10.1038/s41573-021-00245-x|issn=1474-1784|pmid=34285415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design and development ==
The protein targeting warhead, E3 ligase, and linker must all be considered for PROTAC development. Formation of a [[ternary complex]] between the protein of interest, PROTAC, and E3 ligase may be evaluated to characterize PROTAC activity because it often leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the targeted protein.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A [[hook effect]] is commonly observed with high concentrations of PROTACs due to the bifunctional nature of the degrader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Currently, [[Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor|pVHL]] and [[Cereblon|CRBN]] have been used in preclinical trials as E3 ligases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there still remains hundreds of E3 ligases to be explored, with some giving the opportunity for cell specificity.

== Benefits ==
Compared to traditional inhibitors, PROTACs display multiple benefits that make them desirable drug candidates. Due to their catalytic mechanism, PROTACs can be administered at lower doses compared to their inhibitor analogues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some PROTACs have been shown to be more selective than their inhibitor analogues, reducing off-target effects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; PROTACs have the ability to target previously undruggable proteins, as they do not need to target catalytic pockets.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This also helps prevent mutation-driven [[drug resistance]] often found with enzymatic inhibitors.

Adjusting each of these mechanisms based on the need for specific proteins is essential to maintain all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded [[proteome]].

== Mechanisms of proteostasis ==

===The roles of the ribosome in proteostasis ===

One of the first points of regulation for proteostasis is during [[translation (biology)|translation]]. This is accomplished via the structure of the [[ribosome]], a complex central to translation. These two characteristics shape the way the protein folds and influences the proteins future interactions. The synthesis of a new [[peptide]] chain using the ribosome is very slow and the ribosome can even be stalled when it encounters a [[Genetic code|rare codon]], a codon found at low concentrations in the cell.&lt;ref name =Cavagnero&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fedyukina DV, Cavagnero S | title = Protein folding at the exit tunnel | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics | volume = 40 | pages = 337–59 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21370971 | pmc = 5807062 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155338 | name-list-style = amp }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pauses provide an opportunity for an individual [[protein domain]] to have the necessary time to become folded before the production of following domains. This facilitates the correct folding of multi-domain proteins.&lt;ref name = Cavagnero/&gt;
The newly synthesized peptide chain exits the ribosome into the cellular environment through the narrow [[Eukaryotic Ribosome (80S)#Protein Translocation and Targeting|ribosome exit channel]] (width: 10Å to 20Å, length 80Å).&lt;ref name = Cavagnero/&gt; Due to space restriction in the exit channel the nascent chain already forms [[Protein secondary structure|secondary]] and limited [[Biomolecular structure#Tertiary structure|tertiary]] structures. For example, an [[alpha helix]] is one such structural property that is commonly induced in this exit channel.&lt;ref name =Bustamante&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bustamante CJ, Kaiser CM, Maillard RA, Goldman DH, Wilson CA | title = Mechanisms of cellular proteostasis: insights from single-molecule approaches | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics | volume = 43 | pages = 119–40 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24895851 | pmc = 4620553 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biophys-051013-022811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the exit channel also prevents premature folding by impeding large scale interactions within the peptide chain which would require more space.

=== Molecular chaperones and post-translational maintenance in proteostasis ===

In order to maintain protein homeostasis post-translationally, the cell makes use of [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] sometimes including [[chaperonin]]s, which aid in the assembly or disassembly of proteins.&lt;ref name =Ye&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YE, Hipp MS, Bracher A, Hayer-Hartl M, Hartl FU | title = Molecular chaperone functions in protein folding and proteostasis | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 82 | pages = 323–55 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23746257 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060208-092442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They recognize exposed segments of [[Amino acid#Physicochemical properties of amino acids|hydrophobic amino acids]] in the nascent peptide chain and then work to promote the proper formation of [[Non-covalent interactions|noncovalent interactions]] that lead to the desired folded state.&lt;ref name = Ye/&gt; 
Chaperones begin to assist in protein folding as soon as a nascent chain longer than 60 amino acids emerges from the ribosome exit channel.&lt;ref name =Vabulas&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vabulas RM, Raychaudhuri S, Hayer-Hartl M, Hartl FU | title = Protein folding in the cytoplasm and the heat shock response | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = a004390 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21123396 | pmc = 2982175 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a004390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most studied ribosome binding chaperones is trigger factor. Trigger factor works to stabilize the peptide, promotes its folding, prevents aggregation, and promotes refolding of denatured model substrates.&lt;ref name =Hoffman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffmann A, Bukau B, Kramer G | title = Structure and function of the molecular chaperone Trigger Factor | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research | volume = 1803 | issue = 6 | pages = 650–61 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20132842 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.01.017 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ribosome profiling experiments have shown that TF predominantly targets ribosomes translating outer membrane proteins in vivo, and moreover are underrepresented on ribosomes translating inner membrane proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh E, Becker AH, Sandikci A, Huber D, Chaba R, Gloge F, Nichols RJ, Typas A, Gross CA, Kramer G, Weissman JS, Bukau B | display-authors = 6 | title = Selective ribosome profiling reveals the cotranslational chaperone action of trigger factor in vivo | journal = Cell | volume = 147 | issue = 6 | pages = 1295–308 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22153074 | pmc = 3277850 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trigger factor not only directly works to properly fold the protein but also recruits other chaperones to the ribosome, such as Hsp70. Hsp70 surrounds an unfolded peptide chain, thereby preventing aggregation and promoting folding.&lt;ref name = Ye/&gt;&lt;ref name = Vabulas/&gt;

Chaperonins are a special class of chaperones that promote native state folding by cyclically encapsulating the peptide chain.&lt;ref name = Vabulas/&gt; Chaperonins are divided into two groups. [[Chaperonin#Classification|Group 1]] chaperonins are commonly found in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. [[Chaperonin#Classification|Group 2]] chaperonins are found in both the cytosol of eukaryotic cells as well as in archaea.&lt;ref name =Yébenes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yébenes H, Mesa P, Muñoz IG, Montoya G, Valpuesta JM | title = Chaperonins: two rings for folding | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 36 | issue = 8 | pages = 424–32 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21723731 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2011.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Group 2 chaperonins also contain an additional helical component which acts as a lid for the cylindrical protein chamber, unlike Group 1 which instead relies on an extra cochaperone to act as a lid. All chaperonins exhibit two states (open and closed), between which they can cycle. This cycling process is important during the folding of an individual polypeptide chain as it helps to avoid undesired interactions as well as to prevent the peptide from entering into kinetically trapped states.&lt;ref name = Yébenes/&gt;

=== Regulating proteostasis by protein degradation ===

The third component of the proteostasis network is the protein degradation machinery. Protein degradation occurs in proteostasis when the cellular signals indicate the need to decrease overall cellular protein levels. The effects of protein degradation can be local, with the cell only experiencing effects from the loss of the degraded protein itself or widespread, with the entire protein landscape changing due to loss of other proteins’ interactions with the degraded protein.&lt;ref name = Bustamante/&gt; Multiple substrates are targets for proteostatic degradation. These degradable substrates include nonfunctional protein fragments produced from ribosomal stalling during translation, misfolded or unfolded proteins, aggregated proteins, and proteins that are no longer needed to carry out cellular function. Several different pathways exist for carrying out these degradation processes. When proteins are determined to be unfolded or misfolded, they are typically degraded via the [[unfolded protein response]] (UPR) or [[endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation]] (ERAD). Substrates that are unfolded, misfolded, or no longer required for cellular function can also be [[ubiquitin]] tagged for degradation by ATP dependent proteases, such as the [[proteasome]] in eukaryotes or ClpXP in prokaryotes. [[Autophagy]], or self engulfment, lysosomal targeting, and [[phagocytosis]] (engulfment of waste products by other cells) can also be used as proteostatic degradation mechanisms.&lt;ref name = Bustamante/&gt;

== Signaling events in proteostasis ==

Protein misfolding is detected by mechanisms that are specific for the cellular compartment in which they occur. Distinct surveillance mechanisms that respond to unfolded protein have been characterized in the cytoplasm, ER and mitochondria. This response acts locally in a cell autonomous fashion but can also extend to intercellular signaling to protect the organism from anticipated proteotoxic stress.

=== Cell-autonomous stress responses ===

Cellular stress response pathways detect and alleviate proteotoxic stress which is triggered by imbalances in proteostasis. The cell-autonomous regulation occurs through direct detection of  misfolded proteins or inhibition of pathway activation by sequestering activating components in response to heat shock. Cellular responses to this stress signaling include transcriptional activation of chaperone expression, increased efficiency in protein trafficking and protein degradation and translational reduction.
[[File:Stress signaling.png|thumb|Proteostasis stress signaling response]]

=== Cytosolic heat shock response ===

The cytosolic HSR is mainly mediated by the transcription factor family HSF (heat shock family). HSF is constitutively bound by Hsp90. Upon a proteotoxic stimulus Hsp90 is recruited away from HSF which can then bind to heat response elements in the DNA and upregulate gene expression of proteins involved in the maintenance of proteostasis.

=== ER unfolded protein response ===

The unfolded protein response in the [[endoplasmatic reticulum]] (ER) is activated by imbalances of unfolded proteins inside the ER and the proteins mediating protein homeostasis. Different “detectors” - such as IRE1, ATF6 and PERK - can recognize misfolded proteins in the ER and mediate transcriptional responses which help alleviate the effects of ER stress.

=== Mitochondrial unfolded protein response ===

The mitochondrial unfolded protein response detects imbalances in protein stoichiometry of mitochondrial proteins and misfolded proteins. The expression of mitochondrial chaperones is upregulated by the activation of the transcription factors ATF-1 and/or DVE-1 with UBL-5.

=== Systemic stress signaling ===

Stress responses can also be triggered in a non-cell autonomous fashion by intercellular communication. The stress that is sensed in one tissue could thereby be communicated to other tissues to protect the proteome of the organism or to regulate proteostasis systemically. Cell non-autonomous activation can occur for all three stress responses.

Work on the model organism ''C. elegans'' has shown that neurons play a role in this intercellular communication of cytosolic HSR. Stress induced in the neurons of the worm can in the long run protect other tissues such as muscle and intestinal cells from chronic [[proteotoxicity]]. Similarly ER and mitochondrial UPR in neurons are relayed to intestinal cells . These systemic responses have been implicated in mediating not only systemic proteostasis but also influence organismal aging.&lt;ref name =Taylor&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor RC, Berendzen KM, Dillin A | title = Systemic stress signalling: understanding the cell non-autonomous control of proteostasis | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 211–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24556842 | pmc = 5922984 | doi = 10.1038/nrm3752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diseases of proteostasis ==

=== Proteostasis and diseases of protein folding ===
Dysfunction in proteostasis can arise from errors in or misregulation of protein folding. The classic examples are missense mutations and deletions that change the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the protein folding process.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; These mutations are often inherited and range in phenotypic severity from having no noticeable effect to embryonic lethality. Disease develops when these mutations render a protein significantly more susceptible to misfolding, aggregation, and degradation. If these effects only alter the mutated protein, the negative consequences will only be local loss of function. However, if these mutations occur in a chaperone or a protein that interacts with many other proteins, dramatic global alterations in the proteostasis boundary will occur. Examples of diseases resulting from proteostatic changes from errors in protein folding include cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, lysosomal storage disorders, and others.&lt;ref name =Hipp&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hipp MS, Park SH, Hartl FU | title = Proteostasis impairment in protein-misfolding and -aggregation diseases | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 24 | issue = 9 | pages = 506–14 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24946960 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2014.05.003 | hdl-access = free | hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-0023-FD0F-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The role of model systems in the elucidation of protein-misfolding diseases ===
Small animal model systems have been and continue to be instrumental in the identification of functional mechanisms that safeguard proteostasis. Model systems of diverse misfolding-prone disease proteins have so far revealed numerous chaperone and co-chaperone modifiers of [[proteotoxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brehme M, Voisine C | title = Model systems of protein-misfolding diseases reveal chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity | journal = Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 823–38 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27491084 | pmc = 5007983 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.024703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteostasis and cancer ===

The unregulated cell division that marks cancer development requires increased protein synthesis for cancer cell function and survival. This increased protein synthesis is typically seen in proteins that modulate cell metabolism and growth processes. Cancer cells are sometimes susceptible to drugs that inhibit chaperones and disrupt proteostasis, such as [[Hsp90 inhibitors]] or [[proteasome inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; Furthermore, cancer cells tend to produce misfolded proteins, which are removed mainly by proteolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen-Kaplan V, Livneh I, Avni N, Cohen-Rosenzweig C, Ciechanover A | title = The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy: Coordinated and independent activities | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 79 | pages = 403–418 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27448843 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2016.07.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibitors of proteolysis allow accumulation of both misfolded protein aggregates, as well as apoptosis signaling proteins in cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moschovi M, Critselis E, Cen O, Adamaki M, Lambrou GI, Chrousos GP, Vlahopoulos S | title = Drugs acting on homeostasis: challenging cancer cell adaptation | journal = Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1405–17 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26523494 | doi = 10.1586/14737140.2015.1095095 | s2cid = 28992964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sionov RV, Vlahopoulos SA, Granot Z | title = Regulation of Bim in Health and Disease | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 6 | issue = 27 | pages = 23058–134 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26405162 | pmc = 4695108 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.5492 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can change the sensitivity of cancer cells to antineoplastic drugs; cancer cells either die at a lower drug concentration, or survive, depending on the type of proteins that accumulate, and the function these proteins have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lambrou GI, Papadimitriou L, Chrousos GP, Vlahopoulos SA | title = Glucocorticoid and proteasome inhibitor impact on the leukemic lymphoblast: multiple, diverse signals converging on a few key downstream regulators | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 351 | issue = 2 | pages = 142–51 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22273806 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.003 | s2cid = 28749125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was the first drug of this type to receive approval for treatment of multiple myeloma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams J | title = Proteasome inhibition in cancer: development of PS-341 | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 613–9 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11740819 | doi = 10.1016/s0093-7754(01)90034-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteostasis and obesity ===

A hallmark of cellular proteostatic networks is their ability to adapt to stress via protein regulation. Metabolic disease, such as that associated with obesity, alters the ability of cellular proteostasis networks adapt to stress, often with detrimental health effects. For example, when insulin production exceeds the cell's insulin secretion capacity, proteostatic collapse occurs and chaperone production is severely impaired. This disruption leads to the disease symptoms exhibited in individuals with diabetes.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt;

=== Proteostasis and aging ===

Over time, the proteostasis network becomes burdened with proteins modified by reactive oxygen species and metabolites that induce oxidative damage.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; These byproducts can react with cellular proteins to cause misfolding and aggregation (especially in nondividing cells like neurons). This risk is particularly high for intrinsically disordered proteins. The IGFR-1 pathway has been shown in ''C. elegans'' to protect against these harmful aggregates, and some experimental work has suggested that upregulation of insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR-1) may stabilize proteostatic network and prevent detrimental effects of aging.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; Expression of the [[chaperome]], the ensemble of chaperones and co-chaperones that interact in a complex network of molecular folding machines to regulate proteome function, is dramatically repressed in human aging brains and in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Functional assays in ''C. elegans'' and human cells have identified a conserved [[chaperome]] sub-network of 16 chaperone genes, corresponding to 28 human orthologs as a proteostasis safeguard in aging and age-onset neurodegenerative disease.
&lt;ref name =Brehme&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brehme M, Voisine C, Rolland T, Wachi S, Soper JH, Zhu Y, Orton K, Villella A, Garza D, Vidal M, Ge H, Morimoto RI | display-authors = 6 | title = A chaperome subnetwork safeguards proteostasis in aging and neurodegenerative disease | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 1135–50 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25437566 | pmc = 4255334 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmacologic intervention in proteostasis ===

There are two main approaches that have been used for therapeutic development targeting the proteostatic network: pharmacologic chaperones and proteostasis regulators. The principle behind designing pharmacologic chaperones for intervention in diseases of proteostasis is to design small molecules that stabilize proteins exhibiting borderline stability. Previously, this approach has been used to target and stabilize G-protein coupled receptors, neurotransmitter receptors, glycosidases, lysosomal storage proteins, and the mutant CFTR protein that causes cystic fibrosis and transthyretin, which can misfiled and aggregate leading to amyloidoses.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; [[Vertex Pharmaceuticals]] and Pfizer sell regulatory agency approved pharmacologic chaperones for ameliorating cystic fibrosis and the transthyretin amyloidoses, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bulawa CE, Connelly S, Devit M, Wang L, Weigel C, Fleming JA, Packman J, Powers ET, Wiseman RL, Foss TR, Wilson IA, Kelly JW, Labaudinière R | display-authors = 6 | title = Tafamidis, a potent and selective transthyretin kinetic stabilizer that inhibits the amyloid cascade | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 24 | pages = 9629–34 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22645360 | pmc = 3386102 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1121005109 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.9629B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amicus sells a regulatory agency approved pharmacologic chaperone for Fabry disease–a lysosomal storage disease.
      	
The principle behind proteostasis regulators is different, these molecules alter the biology of protein folding and / or degradation by altering the stoichiometry of the proteostasis network components in a given sub cellular compartment. For example, some proteostasis regulators initiate stress responsive signaling, such as the unfolded protein response, which transcriptionally reprograms the endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plate L, Cooley CB, Chen JJ, Paxman RJ, Gallagher CM, Madoux F, Genereux JC, Dobbs W, Garza D, Spicer TP, Scampavia L, Brown SJ, Rosen H, Powers ET, Walter P, Hodder P, Wiseman RL, Kelly JW | display-authors = 6 | title = Small molecule proteostasis regulators that reprogram the ER to reduce extracellular protein aggregation | journal = eLife | volume = 5 | pages = 15550 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27435961 | pmc = 4954754 | doi = 10.7554/elife.15550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this approach could even be applied prophylactically, such as upregulating certain protective pathways before experiencing an anticipated severe cellular stress. One theoretical mechanism for this approach includes upregulating the heat shock response response to rescue proteins from degradation during cellular stress.&lt;ref name = Powers /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2013}}
{{TopicTOC-Biology}}
'''Protistology''' is a scientific discipline devoted to the study of [[protists]], a highly diverse group of [[Microorganism#Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] organisms. All eukaryotes apart from animals, plants and fungi are considered protists.&lt;ref name="Geisen et al 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geisen |first1=Stefan |last2=Mitchell |first2=Edward A D |last3=Adl |first3=Sina |last4=authors |first4=and 10 further |title=Soil protists: a fertile frontier in soil biology research |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |date=2018 |volume=42 |pages=293–323 |doi=10.1093/femsre/fuy006 |url=https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/42/3/293/4855940 |access-date=25 December 2020|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its field of study therefore overlaps with the more traditional disciplines of [[phycology]], [[mycology]], and [[protozoology]], just as protists embrace mostly [[unicellular]] organisms described as [[algae]], some organisms regarded previously as primitive [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]] ("animal" motile protists lacking chloroplasts).&lt;ref name="Geisen et al 2018" /&gt;

They are a [[paraphyletic group]] with very diverse morphologies and lifestyles. Their sizes range from unicellular [[picoeukaryotes]] only a few micrometres in diameter to multicellular [[marine algae]] several metres long.&lt;ref name="Geisen et al 2018" /&gt; 

==History==
The term "[[protozoology]]" has become dated as understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the eukaryotes has improved, and is frequently replaced by the term "protistology". For example, the Society of Protozoologists, founded in 1947, was renamed International Society of Protistologists in 2005. However, the older term is retained in some cases (e.g., the Polish journal ''Acta Protozoologica'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Home|url=https://protistologists.org/this-url-is-canonical/|access-date=2021-06-28|website=International Society of Protistologists|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sahara 05.jpg|thumb|alt=three plants of different species grow in deep sand|Psammophytes of three different species in the [[Sahara]] desert]]
A '''psammophyte''' is a plant that grows in sandy and often unstable soils. Psammophytes are commonly found growing on [[beaches]], [[deserts]], and [[sand dunes]]. Because they thrive in these challenging or inhospitable [[habitat]]s, psammophytes are considered [[extremophile]]s, and are further classified as a type of [[psammophile]]. 

==Etymology==
The word "psammophyte" consists of two [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English/P–Z|Greek roots]], ''psamm-'', meaning "sand", and ''-phyte'', meaning "plant".&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Etym1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Etym2"/&gt; The term "psammophyte" first entered English in the early twentieth century via German botanical terminology.&lt;ref name="Lex"/&gt;

==Description==
Psammophytes are found in many different plant families, so may not share specific [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[phytochemistry|phytochemical]] traits. They also come in a variety of plant life-forms, including [[ephemeral plant|annual ephemerals]], [[perennial]]s, [[subshrub]]s, [[Raunkiær plant life-form#Hemicryptophytes|hemicryptophytes]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Azizi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neto"/&gt; What the many diverse psammophytes have in common is a resilience to harsh or rapidly fluctuating environmental factors, such as shifting soils, strong winds, intense sunlight exposure, or saltwater exposure, depending on the habitat.&lt;ref name="Neto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qu"/&gt; Psammophytes often have specialized traits, such as unusually tenacious or resilient roots that enable them to anchor and thrive despite various environmental stressors.&lt;ref name="Jian"/&gt; Those growing in arid regions have evolved highly efficient physiological mechanisms that enable them to survive despite limited water availability.&lt;ref name="Xeri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Sahara 04.jpg|thumb|alt=sparse grass plants growing in loose sand|[[Poaceae|Grass family]] psammophytes of the [[Sahara]] desert in Algeria]]
[[File:Bolonia (1981) 05.jpg|thumb|alt=grass-like plants growing in deep sand drifts with bluffs in the distance|Psammophytes growing in sand drifts at [[Duna de Bolonia]], [[Tarifa]], [[Cádiz, Andalusia]], [[Spain]]]]
[[File:Haloxylon ammodendron levél.jpg|thumb|''[[Haloxylon ammodendron]]'', Mongolian psammophyte]]
Psammophytes grow in regions all over the world and can be found on sandy, unstable soils of [[beaches]], [[deserts]], and [[sand dunes]].&lt;ref name="Azizi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valcheva"/&gt; In China's autonomous [[Inner Mongolia]] region, psammophytic woodlands are found in steppe habitats.&lt;ref name="Cui"/&gt;

==Ecology==
Psammophytes often play an important ecological role by contributing some degree of soil stabilization in their sandy habitats.&lt;ref name="Symonides"/&gt; They can also play an important role in [[Nutrient cycle|soil nutrient dynamics]].&lt;ref name="Ning"/&gt; Depending on the factors at play at a given site, psammophyte communities exhibit varying degrees of [[species diversity]].&lt;ref name="Martínez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Azizi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valcheva"/&gt; For example, in the dunes of the [[Sahara Desert]], psammophyte communities exhibit limited diversity and are predominantly made up of plants from the [[Poaceae|grass]] and [[Brassicaceae|mustard]] families.&lt;ref name="Azizi"/&gt;

Like many other types of plants, psammophytes can have symbiotic relationships with [[microorganism]]s called [[endophyte]]s that live inside of their tissues, which can impart enhanced growth or other benefits.&lt;ref name="Zhu"/&gt;

==Conservation==
A major threat to psammophytes in many regions is dune destabilization, which is exacerbated by human development projects and factors associated with [[climate change]], such as drought and temperature increases.&lt;ref name="Thom"/&gt; Encroachment of non-psammophytic plants and invasive species poses another threat to psammophyte species in some areas.&lt;ref name="Valcheva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Souza"/&gt; [[Restoration ecology|Ecological restoration]] efforts in psammophyte habitats often aim to utilize the natural soil stabilizing and nutrient enhancement abilities of psammophytes as part of restoration strategies.&lt;ref name="Martínez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ning"/&gt; Another important strategy is restoring and protecting the requisite [[Soil biology|soil microbiome]] some psammophytes require to thrive.&lt;ref name="Souza"/&gt;

China's Minqin Garden of Desert Plants is one organization that is actively working on efforts to conserve both wild and horticultural psammophyte species.&lt;ref name="gard"/&gt;

==Examples==
Some examples of psammophyte species include:

* ''[[Agriophyllum squarrosum]]'' (sand rice)&lt;ref name="Qu"/&gt;
* ''[[Haloxylon ammodendron]]'' (saxaul)&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;
* ''[[Linaria arenaria]]'' (sand toadflax)&lt;ref name="Lemauviel"/&gt;
* ''[[Omphalodes kuzinskyanae]]'' (Kuzinsky navelwort)&lt;ref name="Neto"/&gt;
* ''[[Stipagrostis pungens]]'' (madjiugu)&lt;ref name="Azizi"/&gt;

The '''pulse vaccination strategy''' is a method used to eradicate an epidemic by repeatedly vaccinating a group at risk, over a defined age range, until the spread of the pathogen has been stopped. It is most commonly used during measles and polio epidemics to quickly stop the spread and contain the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;Nokes, DJ., Swinton, J.

[[Image:Microbiologist 01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A microbiologist runs a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis test used in bacterial typing]]
'''Pulsed field gel electrophoresis''' is a technique used for the separation of large [[DNA]] [[molecule]]s by applying to a [[gel]] matrix an [[electric field]] that periodically changes direction.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann1998"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1385/0-89603-498-4:33 |chapter=Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis |title=Molecular Bacteriology |year=1998 |last1=Kaufmann |first1=Mary Elizabeth |series=Methods in Molecular Medicine |volume=15 |pages=33–50 |pmid=21390741 |isbn=0-89603-498-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HerschlebAnaniev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herschleb |first1=Jill |last2=Ananiev |first2=Gene |last3=Schwartz |first3=David C |title=Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis |journal=Nature Protocols |date=March 2007 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=677–684 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.94 |pmid=17406630 |s2cid=13265518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Standard [[DNA electrophoresis|gel electrophoresis]] techniques for separation of DNA molecules provided huge advantages for molecular biology research. However, it was unable to separate very large molecules of DNA effectively. DNA molecules larger than 15–20 kb migrating through a gel will essentially move together in a size-independent manner. At [[Columbia University]] in 1984, David C. Schwartz and [[Charles Cantor]] developed a variation on the standard protocol by introducing an [[Alternating current|alternating]] voltage gradient to improve the resolution of larger molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwartz DC, Cantor CR |title=Separation of yeast chromosome-sized DNAs by pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis |journal=Cell |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=67–75 |date=May 1984 |pmid=6373014 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(84)90301-5 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique became known as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The development of PFGE expanded the range of resolution for DNA fragments by as much as two orders of magnitude.

==Procedure==
[[File:E. coli cluster analysis-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Cluster analysis in [[BioNumerics]] of the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli strains from the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis fingerprinting]]
The procedure for this technique is relatively similar to performing a standard gel electrophoresis except that instead of constantly running the voltage in one direction, the voltage is periodically switched among three directions; one that runs through the central axis of the gel and two that run at an angle of 60 degrees either side. The pulse times are equal for each direction resulting in a net forward migration of the DNA. For extremely large molecules (up to around 2 Mb), switching-interval ramps can be used that increases the pulse time for each direction over the course of a number of hours—take, for instance, increasing the pulse linearly from 10 seconds at 0 hours to 60 seconds at 18 hours.

This procedure takes longer than normal gel electrophoresis due to the size of the fragments being resolved and the fact that the DNA does not move in a straight line through the gel.

==Theory==
While in general small fragments can find their way through the gel matrix more easily than large DNA fragments, a threshold length exists above 30–50 kb where all large fragments will run at the same rate, and appear in a gel as a single large diffuse band.

However, with periodic changing of field direction, the various lengths of DNA react to the change at differing rates. That is, larger pieces of DNA will be slower to realign their charge when field direction is changed, while smaller pieces will be quicker.  Over the course of time with the consistent changing of directions, each band will begin to separate more and more even at very large lengths. Thus separation of very large DNA pieces using PFGE is made possible.

==Applications==

PFGE may be used for [[genotyping]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]. It has commonly been considered a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] in [[epidemiological]] studies of pathogenic organisms for several decades. For instance, subtyping bacterial isolates with this method has made it easier to discriminate among strains of ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', ''[[Lactococcus garvieae]]''&lt;ref&gt; Rao, S, Chen, M-Y, Sudpraseart, C, et al.

The '''Purple Earth hypothesis''' is an [[astrobiology|astrobiological]] hypothesis that photosynthetic life forms of early Earth were based on the simpler molecule [[retinal]] rather than the more complex [[chlorophyll]], making Earth appear purple rather than green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=DasSarma|first1=Shiladitya|last2=Schwieterman|first2=Edward W.|date=11 October 2018|title=Early evolution of purple retinal pigments on Earth and implications for exoplanet biosignatures|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/early-evolution-of-purple-retinal-pigments-on-earth-and-implications-for-exoplanet-biosignatures/63A1AD8AF544BEEF4C6D4A2D53130327|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=241–250|doi=10.1017/S1473550418000423|issn=1473-5504|arxiv=1810.05150|df=dmy-all|bibcode=2018arXiv181005150D|s2cid=119341330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparks|first1=William B. |last2=DasSarma|first2=S. |last3=Reid|first3=I.

The haloarchaeal purple membrane constitutes one of the simplest known bioenergetic systems for harvesting light energy.

Retinal-containing purple membrane exhibits a single light absorption peak centered in the [[Visible spectrum|green-yellow energy-rich region of the solar spectrum]], but allows transmission of red and blue light, resulting in a deep purple color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoeckenius|first=Walther|date=1976|title=The Purple Membrane of Salt-loving Bacteria|journal=Scientific American|volume=234|issue=6|pages=38–47|issn=0036-8733|jstor=24950370|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0676-38|pmid=935845|bibcode=1976SciAm.234f..38S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorophyll pigments, in contrast, absorb red and blue light, but little or no green light, which results in the characteristic green color of plants, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic membranes. Microorganisms with purple and green pigments frequently co-exist in stratified communities where they may utilize complementary regions of the solar spectrum.

The simplicity of haloarchaeal retinal pigments in comparison to the more complex chlorophyll-based photosynthetic membrane, their association with isoprenoid lipids in the cell membrane, as well as the discovery of archaeal membrane components in ancient sediments on the early Earth are consistent with an early appearance of life forms with purple membrane prior to green photosynthesis. 

Co-existence of purple and green pigment containing microorganisms in many environments suggests their co-evolution. Astrobiologists have suggested that retinal pigments may serve as remote biosignatures in exoplanet research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schwieterman|first1=Edward W.|last2=Kiang|first2=Nancy Y.|last3=Parenteau|first3=Mary N.|last4=Harman|first4=Chester E.|last5=DasSarma|first5=Shiladitya|last6=Fisher|first6=Theresa M.|last7=Arney|first7=Giada N.|last8=Hartnett|first8=Hilairy E.|author-link8=Hilairy Hartnett|last9=Reinhard|first9=Christopher T.|date=June 1, 2018|title=Exoplanet Biosignatures: A Review of Remotely Detectable Signs of Life|journal=Astrobiology|volume=18|issue=6|pages=663–708|doi=10.1089/ast.2017.1729|issn=1531-1074|pmc=6016574|pmid=29727196|df=dmy-all|bibcode=2018AsBio..18..663S|arxiv=1705.05791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This hypothesis has great implications on the search for living organisms on other planets, historically we would search for planets that we expected to have [[chlorophyll]] which absorbs the green and red wavelengths of the sun. This means planets that reflect less red light are more likely to have living organisms. The Purple Earth hypothesis suggests that there are other methods for living organisms to convert light into energy and therefore we should expand our search and look for purple planets as well as green ones.

Samson transferred the species to ''[[Paecilomyces]]''.&lt;ref name=Samson1974/&gt; Publications in the 2000s (decade) indicated that the genus ''[[Paecilomyces]]'' was not [[monophyletic]],&lt;ref name=Inglis2006/&gt; and that close relatives were ''Paecilomyces nostocoides'', ''Isaria takamizusanensis'' and ''Nomuraea atypicola''.&lt;ref name=Sung2007/&gt; The new genus ''Purpureocillium'' was created to hold the taxon. The generic name refers to the purple conidia produced by the fungus.&lt;ref name=LuangsArd2011/&gt;

==Description==
''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' forms a dense [[mycelium]] which gives rise to [[conidium|conidiophores]]. These bear [[phialides]] from the ends of which spores are formed in long chains. Spores germinate when suitable moisture and nutrients are available. Colonies on malt agar grow rather fast, attaining a diameter of 5–7&amp;nbsp;cm within 14&amp;nbsp;days at {{convert|25|C|F}}, consisting of a basal felt with a [[wikt:floccose|floccose]] overgrowth of aerial [[mycelium]]; at first white, but when sporulating changing to various shades of [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]. The reverse side is sometimes uncolored but usually in vinaceous shades. The vegetative [[hypha]]e are smooth-walled, [[hyaline]], and 2.5–4.0&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] wide. Conidiophores arising from submerged hyphae, 400–600&amp;nbsp;µm in length, or arising from aerial hyphae and half as long. Phialides consisting of a swollen basal part, tapering into a thin distinct neck. [[Conidium|Conidia]] are in divergent chains, ellipsoid to [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] in shape, and smooth walled to slightly roughened. [[Chlamydospore]]s are absent.&lt;ref name=Samson1974/&gt;

==Life cycles==

''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' is highly adaptable in its life strategy: depending on the availability of nutrients in the surrounding microenvironments it may be [[Entomopathogenic fungus|entomopathogenic]],&lt;ref name=Rombach1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marti2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiedler2007/&gt; [[mycoparasitic]],&lt;ref name=Gupta1993/&gt; [[saprophytic]],&lt;ref name=TigranoMilani1995/&gt; as well as [[Nematophagous fungus|nematophagous]].

==Human pathogenicity==
''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' is an infrequent cause of human disease.&lt;ref name=Saberhagen1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Westenfeld1996/&gt; Most reported cases involve patients with compromised [[immune system]]s, indwelling foreign devices, or [[intraocular lens]] implants.&lt;ref name=ODay1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pettit1980/&gt; Research of the last decade suggests it may be an emerging pathogen of both immunocompromised&lt;ref name=Safdar2002/&gt; as well as immunocompetent adults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no9/02-0654.htm Carey J, D’Amico R, Sutton DA, Rinaldi MG. Paecilomyces lilacinus vaginitis in an immunocompetent patient. Emerg Infect Dis &amp;#91;serial online&amp;#93; 2003 Sep]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biocontrol agent==
[[File:A juvenile root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) penetrates a tomato root - USDA-ARS.jpg|thumb|right|''P. lilacinum'' is used as a biocontrol agent for several nematode species, such as ''[[Meloidogyne incognita]]'', shown here.]]
Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant economic losses to a wide variety of crops. Chemical control is a widely used option for plant-parasitic nematode management. However, chemical nematicides are now being reappraised in respect of [[environmental hazard]], high costs, limited availability in many developing countries or their diminished effectiveness following repeated applications.

=== Control of plant-parasitic nematodes ===
''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' was first observed in association with nematode eggs in 1966&lt;ref name=Lysek1966/&gt; and the fungus was subsequently found parasitising the eggs of ''[[Meloidogyne incognita]]'' in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=Jatala1979/&gt; It has now been isolated from many cyst and root-knot nematodes and from soil in many locations.&lt;ref name="S1991"&gt;{{cite book| last =Stirling |first =GR | title =Biological Control of Plant Parasitic Nematodes |publisher =CABI Publishing | year =1991 | location =UK | pages =282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stirling1991/&gt; Several successful field trials using ''P.&amp;nbsp;lilacinum'' against pest nematodes were conducted in Peru.&lt;ref name=Jatala1979/&gt; The Peruvian isolate was then sent to nematologists in 46 countries for testing, as part of the International Meloidogyne project, resulting in many more [[field trial]]s on a range of crops in many soil types and climates.&lt;ref name=Jatala1986/&gt; Field trials, glasshouse trials and in vitro testing of ''P.&amp;nbsp;lilacinum'' continues and more isolates have been collected from soil, nematodes and occasionally from insects. Isolates vary in their pathogenicity to plant-parasitic nematodes. Some isolates are aggressive parasites while others, though morphologically indistinguishable, are less or non-pathogenic. Sometimes isolates that looked promising ''in vitro'' or in glasshouse trials have failed to provide control in the field.&lt;ref name=Gomes1991/&gt;

=== Enzymes ===
Many [[enzyme]]s produced by ''P. lilacinum'' have been studied. A basic [[serine protease]] with biological activity against ''[[Meloidogyne hapla]]'' eggs has been identified.&lt;ref name=Bonants1995/&gt; One strain of ''P.&amp;nbsp;lilacinum'' has been shown to produce [[protease]]s and a [[chitinase]], enzymes that could weaken a nematode egg shell so as to enable a narrow infection peg to push through.&lt;ref name=Khan2004/&gt;

=== Egg infection ===
Before infecting a nematode egg, ''P.&amp;nbsp;lilacinum'' flattens against the egg surface and becomes closely [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] to it. ''P.&amp;nbsp;lilacinum'' produces simple [[appressoria]] anywhere on the nematode egg shell either after a few [[hyphae]] grow along the egg surface, or after a network of hyphae form on the egg. The presence of appressoria appears to indicate that the egg is, or is about to be, infected. In either case, the appressorium appears the same, as a simple swelling at the end of a [[hypha]], closely appressed to the eggshell. Adhesion between the appressorium and nematode egg surface must be strong enough to withstand the opposing force produced by the extending tip of a penetration hypha.&lt;ref name=Money1998/&gt; When the hypha has penetrated the egg, it rapidly destroys the juvenile within, before growing out of the now empty egg shell to produce [[conidiophores]] and to grow towards adjacent eggs.

==Mycotoxins==
Paecilotoxin is a mycotoxin isolated from the fungus.&lt;ref name=Mikami1989/&gt; Its significance is unknown. Khan et al. (2003) tested one strain of ''P. lilacinum'' for the production of paecilotoxin and were unable to show toxin production in that strain, suggesting that toxin synthesis may vary among isolates.&lt;ref name=Khan2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Park2004/&gt;

The '''Pusztai affair''' is a controversy that began in 1998. [[Protein]] scientist [[Árpád Pusztai]] went public with the initial results of unpublished research he was conducting at the [[Rowett Institute]] in Aberdeen, Scotland, investigating the possible effects of [[genetically modified potato]]es upon rats. Pusztai claimed that the genetically modified potatoes had stunted growth and repressed the rats' immune systems while thickening their gut mucosa. Initially supported by the Rowett Institute, his  comments on a British television programme caused a storm of controversy, and the Rowett Institute withdrew its support. Pusztai was suspended and misconduct procedures were used to seize his data and ban him from speaking publicly. The institute did not renew his annual contract and Pusztai was criticized by the British Royal Society and some other scientists for making an announcement before his experiment was complete or peer-reviewed and for the experiment's design, methodology and analysis. Some of the data from the study was eventually published in The Lancet in 1999 after five out of six peer reviewers approved of the study&lt;ref name="Academic Experts, Higher Education Profile"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Randerson|first1=James|title=Arpad Pusztai: Biological divide|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jan/15/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|access-date=5 December 2017|agency=The Guardian|work=The Guardian|date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; – triggering further controversy.

==Background==
Before 1995, no peer-reviewed studies had been published investigating the safety of [[genetically modified food]] using human or animal feeding trials.&lt;ref name = "Domingo"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Domingo JL| title = Toxicity Studies of Genetically Modified Plants: A Review of the Published Literature | doi = 10.1080/10408390601177670 | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 721–733 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17987446| citeseerx = 10.1.1.662.4707 | s2cid = 15329669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the Scottish [[Scottish Government Environment Directorates|Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department]] commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] [[desiree potato|Desiree Red potatoes]].&lt;ref name="Arpad article"/&gt; The potatoes had been developed by biochemist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/biosciences/research/staffprofiles/?id=13 Professor J.A.

Twenty-eight studies were proposed, of which eight were  selected for peer review by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]]. From these eight the [[Rowett Research Institute]]'s proposal was chosen and a combined team of academics from the [[Scottish Crop Research Institute]], the [[Durham University|Durham University Department of Biology]] and the Rowett Institute was assembled, and coordinated by Pusztai.&lt;ref name="Arpad article"/&gt;

==Experiment==
The experimental potatoes had been [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with the ''[[Galanthus nivalis]] [[agglutinin]]'' (GNA) [[gene]] from the ''[[Galanthus]]'' (snowdrop) plant, allowing the GNA [[lectin|lectin protein]] to be [[Protein biosynthesis|synthesised]]. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified [[Désirée (potato)|Desiree Red potatoes]] as [[scientific control|controls]]. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt; Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days).&lt;ref name="audit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmoarchive/gmaudit.pdf |title=Audit of data produced at the Rowett Research Institute|date=21 August 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104039/http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmoarchive/gmaudit.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Meikle|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 1999|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/oct/05/gm.food|title=Journal to publish GM food hazards research|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arpad Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcoalition.ca/pusztai.html|title=Interview with Arpad Pusztai|publisher=Canadian Health Coalition|date=10 November 2000|access-date=2010-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722080050/http://www.healthcoalition.ca/pusztai.html|archive-date=2010-07-22|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potatoes were chosen because they were deemed [[Substantial equivalence|substantially equivalent]] to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Millstone | first1 = E. | last2 = Brunner | first2 = E. | last3 = Mayer | first3 = S. | title = Beyond 'substantial equivalence' | journal = Nature | volume = 401 | issue = 6753 | pages = 525–526 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1038/44006 | pmid =  10524614| bibcode = 1999Natur.401..525M | s2cid = 4307069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used two [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant.&lt;ref name="audit" /&gt; According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, as one of the transgenic lines contained 20 percent less [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] than the other, and the [[starch]] and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines.&lt;ref name="Tokar"&gt;Brian Tokar ''Redesigning life?: the worldwide challenge to genetic engineering''  [[Zed Books]] Pg 58 {{ISBN|1-85649-835-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.&lt;ref name="Tokar" /&gt;

Their experiment showed a [[statistically significant]] difference in the thickness of the stomach [[mucosa]]. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt; The [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypt]] length in the [[jejunum]] was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt; As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arpad Interview" /&gt; Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the [[cauliflower mosaic virus]] used as a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] could likely be the cause of the observed changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature.berkeley.edu/~steggall/15Jan99-22Apr99.html Evidence of changes in the organs of rats fed genetically modified potatoes suggests minister's safety assurances may be premature]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Guardian February 13, 1999 archived Berkeley University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement==
On June 22, 1998 Pusztai revealed his research findings during an interview on [[Granada Television]]'s current affairs programme ''[[World in Action]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/171778|publisher=The Economist|title=Potato-heads|date=Aug 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled "Eat up your genes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110817071758/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/596535?view=transmission  Eat Up Your Genes (1998)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was given permission to do the interview by Rowett Institute Director Philip James. Rowett's press officer was present at the start of filming. During the interview Pusztai said he had "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what we thought it was necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing."&lt;ref name = "Memorandum"/&gt; When asked why he felt concerned, he said "it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned" and discussed his results in general terms.&lt;ref name = "Memorandum"/&gt;

Pusztai later said that at the time of the interview he was not sure if he should reveal results from experiments that had not been completed and did not think the programme would be hostile toward genetically modified food. He estimated that the experiments were 99 percent complete when the interview was conducted.&lt;ref name="Memorandum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes Of Evidence Taken Before The Science And Technology Committee|date=8 March 1999|url=http://ucbiotech.org/issues_pgl/ARTICLES/Pusztai/Pusztai%20-%20Memorandum%20submitted%20by%20Dr%20Arpad%20Pusztai%20before%20the%20%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Comittee%20of%20the%20UK%20Parliament%20%288.3.1999%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the rats in his experiments suffered stunted growth and had suppressed immune systems and that more safety research was required.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Enserink | first1 = M. | title = Science in Society: Institute Copes with Genetic Hot Potato | doi = 10.1126/science.281.5380.1124b | journal = Science | volume = 281 | issue = 5380 | pages = 1124–5 | year = 1998 | pmid =  9735026| s2cid = 46153553 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e94a3ddf41971eda26694c67d493aaf10cf14a18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, "If you gave me the choice now, I wouldn't eat it"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and it was "very, very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February 12, 1999|title=Sci/TechFears erupt over genetic food|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/278354.stm|newspaper=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
''World in Action'' issued a press release the day before the broadcast,&lt;ref name="Rowell"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rowell |first= Andrew |title= Don't worry, it's safe to eat: the true story of GM food, BSE, &amp; Foot and Mouth |publisher= Earthscan |year=2003 |isbn= 978-1-85383-932-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulating numerous phone calls to Pusztai and the Institute from government, industrial, non-governmental and media organisations. James says he was dismayed that unpublished data had been released and withdrew Pusztai from any further media commitments that morning.&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; He eventually suspended Pusztai, used misconduct procedures to seize his data, banned him from speaking publicly and did not renew his annual contract.&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt;

Confusion reigned over just what experiments had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned two lines of genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media was talking about a second line transformed with [[concanavalin A]] (ConA), a [[Canavalia|Jack Bean]] lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested.&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food scandal: chronology|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 February 1999|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/feb/12/food.science1|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported increased safety tests on [[genetically modified food]].&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy.&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Sir Robert May]] and Agricultural Minister [[Jack Cunningham]] to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato.&lt;ref name="Rowell" /&gt; Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt;

=== Audit ===
The Rowett Institute audited Pusztai's work on  22 October 1998. It concluded that his data did not support his conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmo/ajp.htm |title=Report of Project Coordinator on data produced at the Rowett Research Institute (RRI) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907051021/http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmo/ajp.htm |archive-date=September 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mendel in the kitchen: a scientist's view of genetically modified foods|author1=Nina Vsevolod Fedoroff  |author2=Nancy Marie Brown |name-list-style=amp |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, 22 scientists from 13 countries, organised by [[Friends of the Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, George and Bauer, Martin W., editors, "Biotechnology, 1996–2000, the years of controversy", p. 295. The GM food debate, National Museum of Science and Industry, {{ISBN|978-1-900747-43-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a memo responding to the audit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/feb/12/food.gm Top researchers back suspended lab whistleblower] The Guardian, 12 February 1999, Retrieved 12 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that their independent examination supported Pusztai's conclusions and that he should have been concerned by his findings.

=== Royal Society peer review ===
On 19 February the [[Royal Society]] publicly announced that a committee would review his work. [[World in Action]] reporters Laurie Flynn  and  Michael Sean Gillard claimed that this was an unusual step, as the Royal Society did not normally conduct peer reviews.&lt;ref name="Lachman" /&gt; The data were sent to six anonymous reviewers&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt; and the resulting review was published in June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Noreen et al., (1999) [http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ls39/peer_review/ewen.pdf Review of data on possible toxicity of GM potatoes] The Royal Society, 1 June 1999, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that Pusztai's experiments were poorly designed, contained uncertainties in the composition of diets, tested too few rats, used incorrect statistical methods and lacked consistency within experiments. Pusztai responded by saying the reviewers had reviewed only internal Rowett reports, which did not include the design or methodology of the experiments.&lt;ref name="Arpad article" /&gt;

=== Lancet response ===
The editors of ''[[The Lancet]]'' published an editorial in May 1999 in which they denounced all parties involved, criticizing Pusztai for "unwisely" announcing his results on television and stating that scientists should publish "results in the scientific press, not through the popular media"; the editorial also denounced the Royal Society's review as "breathtaking impertinence".&lt;ref&gt;Editors of the Lancet. [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(99)00093-8/fulltext Health risks of genetically modified foods] The Lancet 353(9167):1811, May 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The data were published as a letter in ''The Lancet'' in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen.&lt;ref name="Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ewen SW, Pusztai A |title=Effect of diets containing genetically modified potatoes expressing Galanthus nivalis lectin on rat small intestine |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9187 |pages=1353–4 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10533866 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)05860-7 |s2cid=17252112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It reported significant differences in the thickness of the gut [[epithelium]] of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested.

The letter was reviewed by six reviewers – three times the Lancet's usual number. Four reviewers found it acceptable after revisions. A fifth thought it was flawed, but wanted it published "to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues a chance to see the data for themselves". The sixth, John Pickett of the [[Institute of Arable Crops Research]], also said it was flawed.&lt;ref name="Enserink1999B"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enserink | first1 = Martin | year = 1999 | title = The Lancet Scolded Over Pusztai Paper | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = 5440| pages = 656a–656 | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5440.656a | pmid=10577214| s2cid = 153199625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After consulting with the Royal Society, Pickett publicly criticised ''The Lancet'' for agreeing to publish the study. The study, which used data held by Ewen,&lt;ref name="Enserink1999A"&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Enserink, M. | title = Bioengineering: Preliminary Data Touch Off Genetic Food Fight | year = 1999 | journal = Science | pages = 1094–5 | volume = 283 | issue = 5405 | pmid = 10075564  | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5405.1094| bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1094. | s2cid = 8268328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was not subject to the veto of Pusztai's work,&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt; reported [[Statistical significance|significant]] differences in thickness of the gut [[epithelium]] between control and test subjects, but did not mention growth or immunity problems.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt;

The published work was criticised on the grounds that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Kuiper | first1 = H. A.| last2 = Noteborn | first2 = H. P. M.| last3 = Peijnenburg | first3 = A. A. M.| title = Adequacy of methods for testing the safety of genetically modified foods| journal = Lancet| volume = 354| issue = 9187| pages = 1315–1316| date=October 1999 | pmid = 10533854| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00341-4| s2cid = 206011261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ewen, SWB |author2=A Pusztai |year=1999 |title=GM food debate |journal=The Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9191 |pages=1726–1727 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)76708-8 |s2cid=54400271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Pickett later said that ''Lancet'' editor [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]] must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.&lt;ref name="Arpad article"/&gt;

Horton claimed that he had received a "very aggressive" phone call calling him "immoral" and threatening that if he published the paper it would "have implications for his personal position" as editor.&lt;ref name="Lachman"/&gt; [[Peter Lachmann]], the former vice-president and biological secretary of the Royal Society and president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, acknowledged making the call but denies that he threatened Horton and says the call was to "discuss his error of judgment" in publishing the letter and to discuss the "moral difficulties about publishing bad science".&lt;ref name="Lachman"&gt;Laurie Flynn and Michael Sean Gillard for The Guardian, October 31, 1999 [https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/nov/01/gm.food Pro-GM scientist "threatened editor"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Ewen retired following publication, claiming that his career options had been "blocked at a very high level".&lt;ref name="Rowell" /&gt;

A survey by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] GMO Panel Working Group on Animal Feeding Trials concluded: "Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2008.02.008 | title = Safety and nutritional assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed: The role of animal feeding trials | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 46 | pages = S2–x2 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18328408| author1 = EFSA GMO Panel Working Group on Animal Feeding Trials }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Pusztai was given a [[whistleblower]] award from the [[Federation of German Scientists (VDW)|Federation of German Scientists]].&lt;ref name="Randerson2"/&gt;

'''PVSRIPO''', or '''PVS-RIPO''', is the name of a modified [[Poliovirus|polio]] virus that has recently shown promise for treating [[cancer]]. It is the focus of [[clinical trial]]s being conducted at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name=brown14&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Michael C.|last2=Dobrikova|first2=Elena Y.|last3=Dobrikov|first3=Mikhail I. |last4=Walton|first4=Ross W. |last5=Gemberling|first5=Sarah L. |last6=Nair|first6=Smita K. |last7=Desjardins |first7=Annick |last8=Sampson |first8=John H. |last9=Friedman |first9=Henry S. |last10=Friedman |first10=Allan H. |last11=Tyler |first11= Douglas S. |last12=Bigner |first12=Darell D. |last13=Gromeier|first13=Matthias|authorlink8=Matthias Gromeier |title=Oncolytic polio virotherapy of cancer|journal=[[Cancer (journal)|Cancer]] |date=1 November 2014 |volume=120 |issue=21 |pages=3277–3286 |doi=10.1002/cncr.28862 |pmid=24939611 |pmc=4205207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVS-RIPO consists of a genetically modified nonpathogenic version of the oral [[poliovirus]] Sabin type 1. The [[internal ribosome entry site]] (IRES) on the poliovirus was replaced with the IRES from [[human rhinovirus]] type 2 (HRV2), to avoid neurovirulence. Once administered, the virus enters and begins replicating within cells that express [[CD155]]/Necl5, which is an onco-fetal [[cell adhesion molecule]] that is common across [[solid tumor]]s.&lt;ref name=FDA-BT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.onclive.com/web-exclusives/oncolytic-poliovirus-receives-breakthrough-designation-for-glioblastoma |title=Oncolytic Poliovirus Receives Breakthrough Designation for Glioblastoma |date=May 2016 |access-date=2016-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034902/http://global.onclive.com/web-exclusives/oncolytic-poliovirus-receives-breakthrough-designation-for-glioblastoma |archive-date=2016-05-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A website at [[Duke University]] describes many of properties of PVSRIPO, and historical background about using viruses to oppose cancer.&lt;ref name=dukectprofile&gt;{{cite web|title=Targeting Cancer with Genetically Engineered Poliovirus (PVS-RIPO)|url=http://www.cancer.duke.edu/btc/modules/Research3/index.php?id=41|website=The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center|access-date=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401063859/http://www.cancer.duke.edu/btc/modules/Research3/index.php?id=41|archive-date=2015-04-01|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that website,
{{blockquote|
The [[FDA]] approved clinical trials with PVS-RIPO in [[brain tumor]] patients recently. Since May 2012, five brain tumor patients have been treated. Remarkably, there have been no toxic side effects with PVS-RIPO whatsoever, even at the highest possible dose (10 billion infectious virus particles).
}}

The potential value of PVSRIPO was the focus of a 2015 story on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref name=60minutes&gt;{{cite news|title=Using polio to kill cancer: A producers' notebook|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/using-polio-to-kill-cancer-60-minutes/|accessdate=31 March 2015|work=60 Minutes Overtime|agency=CBS News|date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] granted it [[breakthrough therapy designation]] for [[glioblastoma]].&lt;ref name=FDA-BT/&gt;

'''Pyrosequencing''' is a method of [[DNA sequencing]] (determining the order of [[nucleotides]] in DNA) based on the "sequencing by synthesis" principle, in which the sequencing is performed by detecting the nucleotide incorporated by a [[DNA polymerase]]. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when [[pyrophosphate]] is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing.

The principle of pyrosequencing was first described in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Nyren, Pettersson and Uhlen (1993) “Solid Phase DNA Minisequencing by an Enzymatic Luminometric Inorganic Pyrophosphate Detection Assay” Analytical Biochemistry 208 (1), 171-175, https://doi.org/10.1006/abio.1993.1024&lt;/ref&gt; by, Bertil Pettersson, Mathias Uhlen and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]] by combining the [[solid phase sequencing]] method&lt;ref&gt;Uhlen (1989) ”Magnetic separation of DNA”  Nature 340: 733-4, https://doi.org/10.1038/340733a0&lt;/ref&gt; using [[streptavidin]] coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3´to 5´exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the [[Luciferase|firefly luciferase]] enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;Nyren and Lundin (1985) “Enzymatic method for continuous monitoring of inorganic pyrophosphate synthesis” Analytiocal Biochemistry 151 (2): 504-509.  https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(85)90211-8&lt;/ref&gt;  A mixture of three [[enzyme]]s ([[DNA polymerase]], [[Sulfate adenylyltransferase|ATP sulfurylase]] and firefly [[luciferase]]) and a nucleotide ([[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTP]]) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined.

A second solution-based method for pyrosequencing was described in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ronaghi |first1=Mostafa |last2=Uhlén |first2=Mathias |last3=Nyrén |first3=Pål |date=1998-07-17 |title=A Sequencing Method Based on Real-Time Pyrophosphate |url=https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.281.5375.363 |journal=Science |volume=281 |issue=5375 |pages=363–365 |language=EN |doi=10.1126/science.281.5375.363|pmid=9705713 |s2cid=26331871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Mostafa Ronaghi]], [https://www.kth.se/en/bio/research/proteomics/proteomics-researchers/mathias-uhlen-1.67763 Mathias Uhlen] and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]]. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme [[apyrase]] is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the [[DNA polymerase]], the [[luciferase]] and the [[apyrase]] to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing.

A third microfluidic variant of the pyrosequencing method was described in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Marguiles et al (2005) “Genome sequencing in microfabricated high-density picolitre reactors” Nature 437, 376-380.  https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature03959;&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jonathan Rothberg]] and co-workers at the company [[454 Life Sciences]]. This alternative approach for pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[microarray]]. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in [[genomics]] research, with rapidly falling prices for [[DNA sequencing]] allowing [[whole genome sequencing]] at affordable prices.

==Procedure ==
[[File:How Pyrosequencing Works.svg|alt=How Pyrosequencing Works|thumb|679x679px|The chart shows how pyrosequencing works.]]
"Sequencing by synthesis" involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of [[DNA polymerase]] (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another [[chemiluminescence|chemoluminescent]] [[enzyme]].  Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of [[DNA]] by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step.  The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T [[nucleotides]] are sequentially added and removed from the reaction.  Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template.  The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=QIAGEN|title=Pyrosequencing Technology and Platform Overview|url=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/technologies/pyrosequencing-resource-center/technology-overview/|access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the solution-based version of pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA ([[ssDNA#ssDNA|ssDNA]]) template is hybridized to a sequencing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] and incubated with the enzymes [[DNA polymerase]], [[ATP sulfurylase]], [[luciferase]] and [[apyrase]], and with the substrates [[adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate]] (APS) and [[luciferin]].
# The addition of one of the four [[deoxynucleotide triphosphate]]s ([[dNTP]]s) (dATPαS, which is not a substrate for a luciferase, is added instead of dATP to avoid noise) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template. This incorporation releases [[pyrophosphate]] (PPi).
# ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in the presence of adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate. This ATP acts as a substrate for the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a camera and analyzed in a program.
# Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the [[apyrase]], and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide.

The process can be represented by the following equations:
* PPi + APS → ATP + Sulfate (catalyzed by ATP-sulfurylase);
* ATP + luciferin + O2 → AMP + PPi + oxyluciferin + CO2 + hv (catalyzed by luciferase);
where:
* PPi is pyrophosphate
* APS is adenosine 5-phosphosulfate;
* ATP is adenosine triphosphate;
* O2 is oxygen molecule;
* AMP is adenosine monophosphate;
* CO2 is carbon dioxide;
* hv is light.

==Limitations==

Currently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with [[DNA sequencing#Chain-termination methods|chain termination]] methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing).  This can make the process of [[genome assembly]] more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of [[repetitive DNA]]. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method.

==Commercialization==

The company '''Pyrosequencing AB''' in [[Uppsala, Sweden]] was founded with [[venture capital]] provided by [[HealthCap]] in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] in 1999. It was renamed to Biotage in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Biotage |title=Biotage History |url=https://www.biotage.com/biotage-history |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=www.biotage.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by [[Qiagen]] in 2008.  Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to [[454 Life Sciences]]. 454 developed an array-based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for [[DNA sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|large-scale DNA sequencing]], including [[genome project|genome sequencing]] and [[metagenomics]].

[[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollmer|first1=Mark|title=Roche to close 454 Life Sciences as it reduces gene sequencing focus |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/roche-to-close-454-life-sciences-as-it-reduces-gene-sequencing-focus|work=Fierce Biotech|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various species of insects have been known to use molecular compounds from [[plants]] for their own defense and even as their [[pheromone]]s or precursors to their pheromones. A few [[Lepidoptera]] have been found to sequester chemicals from plants which they retain throughout their life and some members of [[Erebidae]] are examples of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="reddy2004"&gt;{{citation |author1=Reddy, G.V.P. |author2=A.

==Overview==
[[Pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s are a group of chemicals produced by plants as [[secondary metabolite]]s, all of which contain a [[pyrrolizidine]] nucleus. This nucleus is made up of two [[pyrrole]] rings bonded by one carbon and one nitrogen. There are two forms in which PAs can exist and will readily interchange between: a pro-toxic free base form, also called a tertiary [[amine]], or in a non-toxic form of [[N-oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hartmann, T. |author2=D.

Researchers have collected data that strongly suggests that PAs can be registered by [[taste receptor]]s of [[predator]]s, acting as a deterrent from being ingested.&lt;ref name="eisner1987"&gt;{{citation |author1=Eisner, T |author2=J.

Researchers have found a number of Arctiidae that use PAs for protection and for male [[pheromones]] or precursors of the male pheromones, and some studies have found evidence suggesting PAs have behavioral and developmental effects.

Parsimony suggests that the sequestering of PAs in the larval stage evolved in the subfamily Arctiinae common ancestor. The loss of ability to sequester and use PAs has occurred in a number of species, along with the switch from larval uptake to adult uptake of PAs occurring multiple times within the Arctiinae taxon.&lt;ref name="hartmann2005" /&gt;
 
Members of [[Arctiidae]] typically sequester PAs from their diets, but sometimes must specifically ingest fluids excreted by plants that are not a part of their diets.&lt;ref name="boppre1989" /&gt; Sequestered PAs are kept in various tissues and varying concentration which is dependent upon the species.&lt;ref name="hartmann2005" /&gt; PAs are found in the [[cuticle]] of all studied [[Arctiidae]] mentioned here, but some also package these chemicals into their [[spermatophore]]s as seen in ''[[Creatonotos gangis]]'' and ''[[Creatonotos transiens]]''.&lt;ref name="boppre1985"/&gt; The display of PAs on the [[exoskeleton]] is believed to cue predators to the unpalatability of the [[prey]].

Eisner and Eisner looked at the palatability of PA positive and negative ''U. ornatrix'' to [[wolf spiders]], ''[[Lycosa ceratiola]]'', in both the larval form and adult form.&lt;ref name="eisner1991"/&gt; They found that the pyrrolizidine-positive organisms were typically released unharmed by spiders except in two field circumstances where the larvae were probably envenomated prior to the spider's release and died two days after the attack. All of the PA-negative organisms were eaten by spiders. These findings were in line with prior studies done by Eisner and Meinwald which looked at [[orb weavers]] and ''U. ornatrix'', along with spiders being fed [[beetle]] larva covered in PAs, which they rejected.&lt;ref name="eisner1987" /&gt; All of these findings support PAs being used for defense against predation.

Studies have further elucidated the defenses and uses of PAs in Arctiidae. One study researched ''C. myrodora'' and how PAs protect this species from spider predation among other things.&lt;ref name="conner2000" /&gt; It found that PAs ingested from fluids excreted by plants aided in defense from predation. All organisms permitted access to PA-containing diets that were fed to spiders were cut loose from the webs. Females that had PA-deprived diets, but were allowed to mate with PA-positive males, were also released from the spider's webs. Further observations showed that male ''C. myrodora'' have a pair of pouches where they produce PA-laden filaments, which are typically released over the female prior to [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]] as a [[nuptial gift]]. Experiments show that the filaments give the females more PAs, explaining why spiders released mated PA-negative females from their webs. Most of the PAs from the males were subsequently transferred to the eggs when deposited. Three clusters of eggs that were laid after copulation with a PA-positive male all tested positive for alkaloids and the one cluster that resulted from a PA-negative male copulation tested negative. By the eggs getting a dose of PAs, the authors suggest that the eggs are being protected from predators such as [[Coccinellidae]] beetles.&lt;ref name="conner2000" /&gt;

Jordan and others’ study found a very interesting effect of the larval ingestion of PAs. Male ''[[Estigmene acrea]]'' moths that consumed PAs in their diet as larvae produced [[hydroxydanaidal]], a volatile PA compound, and displayed their [[coremata]]: a bifid, inflatable male-specific organ, used in dispersing pheromones in the adult stage. Larvae that were fed diets without PAs rarely displayed their coremata and did not produce hydroxydanaidal. E. acrea have been observed in the wild displaying their coremata, an activity which attracts both males and females and is known as ''lekking''. Lekking was described by Willis and Birch in 1982, but larvae raised in the laboratory prior to this study rarely engaged in lekking or corematal displays. Scientists were unsure of why this phenomenon didn't occur in the lab, but laboratory raised larvae were usually reared on commercially available food which lacks PAs. The authors suggest that the PAs are used by the males to attract other moths by releasing the volatile PA hydroxydanaidal into the air. It is suggested in this study that this strategy of mate attraction came about by tapping into the PA affinity already programmed into the moths for feeding, which is further supported by the observation that E. acrea females release their pheromones a little bit later in the evening than the males.&lt;ref name="jordan2005" /&gt;
 
Similar uses of coremata to attract other moths have been observed in ''C. gangis'' and ''C. transiens'' along with altered development of coremata when larvae are reared without PAs.&lt;ref name="boppre1985" /&gt; Boppre and Schneider observed adult males of these two species that were not permitted to eat PAs. Their coremata only developed into two, stalk-like projections with very few hairs arising from these stalks. Males that were given plants that produced PAs to feed upon, developed long coremata with four tubes, each longer than the males body, and each tube was highly pubescent. The authors suggest from this observation that there is a basic corematal phenotype, the two stalked coremata, and that PAs are required to form full coremata which is much larger and more elaborate than the basic corematal expression. These observations were further investigated by feeding larvae different amounts of PAs which had a direct correlation to the development of the coremata, which reached a maximum plateau around 2&amp;nbsp;mg of PAs ingested while in larval form. Similar to Jordan and others’ findings, the males raised on a diet devoid of PAs did not produce hydroxydanaidal.&lt;ref name="boppre1985" /&gt;

'''QMCF Technology''' is an episomal [[protein production]] system that uses [[Genetic Modification|genetically modified]] mammalian cells and specially designed [[plasmid]]s. QMCF plasmids carry a combination of [[regulatory sequence]]s from mouse [[polyomavirus]] (Py) [[DNA replication]] origin which in combination with [[Epstein-barr|Epstein-Barr]] virus (EBV) [[EBNA-1]] protein binding site as nuclear retention elements ensure stable propagation of plasmids in mammalian cells. In addition the vectors carry the [[selection marker]] operational for selection of plasmid carrying [[bacteria]] and QMCF cells, bacterial [[ColE1]] origin of replication, and [[Gene cassette|cassette]] for [[Gene expression|expression]] of protein of interest. QMCF [[cell lines]] express [[Large T antigen|Large-T antigen]] and EBNA-1 proteins which bind the viral sequences on the QMCF plasmid and hence support plasmid replication and maintenance in the cells. QMCF Technology has several important differences compared to commonly known transient expression and stable cell line expression systems. Unlike in transient expression system, QMCF Technology enables to maintain episomally replicating QMCF plasmids inside the cells for up to 50 days thus providing an option for production phase of 2–3 weeks. Therefore, the production levels of QMCF Technology are higher (up to 1g/L). Another difference is the option of establishing expression [[cell bank]]s within one week, which is not feasible with transient system. Compared to usage of stable cell line, QMCF technology is a rapid method leaving out time-consuming clone selection step during cell line development.

==Application==
QMCF Technology can be used for the production of proteins, [[Antibody|antibodies]] and virus-like particles for basic research and pharmaceutical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Silla|first1=Toomas|last2=Hääl|first2=Ingrid|last3=Geimanen|first3=Jelizaveta|last4=Janikson|first4=Kadri|last5=Abroi|first5=Aare|last6=Ustav|first6=Ene|last7=Ustav|first7=Mart|date=December 2005|title=Episomal Maintenance of Plasmids with Hybrid Origins in Mouse Cells|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=79|issue=24|pages=15277–15288|doi=10.1128/JVI.79.24.15277-15288.2005|issn=0022-538X|pmc=1316011|pmid=16306599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein production process starts with cloning [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] of a target molecule into QMCF [[expression vector]]. Thereafter 1-6&amp;nbsp;µg of plasmidial DNA is transfected by [[electroporation]] into QMCF cells ([[Cho cell|CHO]] or [[HEK 293 cells|HEK293]] based cells) for expression in serum-free suspension. Since QMCF plasmids contain [[antibiotic resistance]] gene and are able to stably [[Cell replication|replicate]] and remain inside dividing cells, a selection and growth of the [[cell culture]] takes place. This allows to upscale the production into desired volume. Finally, the process is switched to production phase by changing media temperature to  30 ̊C.

Many biological processes involve the conversion of [[energy]] into forms that are usable for chemical transformations, and are quantum mechanical in nature.

==History==
Quantum biology is an emerging field; most of the current research is theoretical and subject to questions that require further experimentation. Though the field has only recently received an influx of attention, it has been conceptualized by physicists throughout the 20th century. It has been suggested that quantum biology might play a critical role in the future of the medical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.36877/pddbs.a0000130|title=Quantum Biology: Does quantum physics hold the key to revolutionizing medicine?|year=2020| vauthors = Goh BH, Tong ES, Pusparajah P |journal=Progress in Drug Discovery &amp; Biomedical Science|volume=3|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early pioneers of quantum physics saw applications of quantum mechanics in biological problems. [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s 1944 book ''What is Life?'' discussed applications of quantum mechanics in biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = [[Lynn Margulis|Margulis L]], [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan D]] |date=1995 |title=What Is Life? |page=1 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schrödinger introduced the idea of an "aperiodic crystal" that contained genetic information in its configuration of covalent [[chemical bond]]s. He further suggested that [[mutation]]s are introduced by "quantum leaps". Other pioneers [[Niels Bohr]], [[Pascual Jordan]], and [[Max Delbrück|Max Delbruck]] argued that the quantum idea of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] was fundamental to the life sciences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joaquim L, Freira O, El-Hani C |title=Quantum Explorers: Bohr, Jordan, and Delbruck Venturing into Biology |journal=Physics in Perspective |date=September 2015 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=236–250 |doi=10.1007/s00016-015-0167-7|bibcode = 2015PhP....17..236J |s2cid=117722573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, [[Per-Olov Löwdin]] published proton [[Tunneling effect|tunneling]] as another mechanism for [[DNA]] mutation. In his paper, he stated that there is a new field of study called "quantum biology".&lt;ref name="Lowdin, P.O. 1965 pp 213–360"&gt;Lowdin, P.O. (1965) Quantum genetics and the aperiodic solid.

=== Photosynthesis ===
{{main|Photosynthesis}}
[[File:FMO Complex Simple Diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of FMO complex. Light excites electrons in an antenna. The excitation then transfers through various proteins in the FMO complex to the reaction center to further photosynthesis.]]
Organisms that undergo photosynthesis absorb light energy through the process of [[electron excitation]] in [[Light-harvesting complexes of green plants|antennae]]. These antennae vary among organisms. For example, bacteria use ring-like antennae, while plants use [[chlorophyll]] [[pigment]]s to absorb photons. Photosynthesis creates [[Exciton|Frenkel excitons]], which provide a separation of charge that cells convert into usable chemical energy. The energy collected in reaction sites must be transferred quickly before it is lost to [[fluorescence]] or thermal vibrational motion.

Various structures, such as the [[Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex|FMO complex]] in green sulfur bacteria, are responsible for transferring energy from antennae to a reaction site.  [[Electron spectroscopy|FT electron spectroscopy]] studies of electron absorption and transfer show an efficiency of above 99%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dostál J, Mančal T, Augulis R, Vácha F, Pšenčík J, Zigmantas D | title = Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy reveals ultrafast energy diffusion in chlorosomes | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 134 | issue = 28 | pages = 11611–11617 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22690836 | doi = 10.1021/ja3025627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which cannot be explained by classical mechanical models  like the [[diffusion]] model. Instead, as early as 1938, scientists theorized that quantum coherence was the mechanism for excitation energy transfer.

Scientists have recently looked for experimental evidence of this proposed energy transfer mechanism. A study published in 2007 claimed the identification of electronic [[quantum coherence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Engel GS, Calhoun TR, Read EL, Ahn TK, Mancal T, Cheng YC, Blankenship RE, Fleming GR | display-authors = 6 | title = Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems | journal = Nature | volume = 446 | issue = 7137 | pages = 782–786 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17429397 | doi = 10.1038/nature05678 | s2cid = 13865546 | bibcode = 2007Natur.446..782E | url = http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/246246/221945/-1/04.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; at −196&amp;nbsp;°C (77 K). Another theoretical study from 2010 provided evidence that quantum coherence lives as long as 300 femtoseconds at biologically relevant temperatures (4&amp;nbsp;°C or 277 K). In that same year, experiments conducted on photosynthetic cryptophyte algae using two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy yielded further confirmation for long-term quantum coherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collini E, Wong CY, Wilk KE, Curmi PM, Brumer P, Scholes GD | title = Coherently wired light-harvesting in photosynthetic marine algae at ambient temperature | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7281 | pages = 644–647 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20130647 | doi = 10.1038/nature08811 | s2cid = 4369439 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..644C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies suggest that, through evolution, nature has developed a way of protecting quantum coherence to enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis. However, critical follow-up studies question the interpretation of these results. Single molecule spectroscopy now shows the quantum characteristics of photosynthesis without the interference of static disorder, and some studies use this method to assign reported signatures of electronic quantum coherence to nuclear dynamics occurring in chromophores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tempelaar R, Jansen TL, Knoester J | title = Vibrational beatings conceal evidence of electronic coherence in the FMO light-harvesting complex | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 118 | issue = 45 | pages = 12865–12872 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25321492 | doi = 10.1021/jp510074q }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christensson N, Kauffmann HF, Pullerits T, Mančal T | title = Origin of long-lived coherences in light-harvesting complexes | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 116 | issue = 25 | pages = 7449–7454 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22642682 | pmc = 3789255 | doi = 10.1021/jp304649c | arxiv = 1201.6325 | bibcode = 2012arXiv1201.6325C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Butkus V, Zigmantas D, Valkunas L, Abramavicius D | title = Vibrational vs. electronic coherences in 2D spectrum of molecular systems| journal = Chem.

In 2017, the first control experiment with the original FMO protein under ambient conditions confirmed that electronic quantum effects are washed out within 60 femtoseconds, while the overall exciton transfer takes a time on the order of a few picoseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duan HG, Prokhorenko VI, Cogdell RJ, Ashraf K, Stevens AL, Thorwart M, Miller RJ | title = Nature does not rely on long-lived electronic quantum coherence for photosynthetic energy transfer | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 114 | issue = 32 | pages = 8493–8498 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28743751 | pmc = 5559008 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1702261114 | arxiv = 1610.08425 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2017PNAS..114.8493D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020 a review based on a wide collection of control experiments and theory concluded that the proposed quantum effects as long lived electronic coherences in the FMO system does not hold.&lt;ref name="Cao2020"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao J, Cogdell RJ, Coker DF, Duan HG, Hauer J, Kleinekathöfer U, Jansen TL, Mančal T, Miller RJ, Ogilvie JP, Prokhorenko VI, Renger T, Tan HS, Tempelaar R, Thorwart M, Thyrhaug E, Westenhoff S, Zigmantas D | display-authors = 6 | title = Quantum biology revisited | journal = Science Advances | volume = 6 | issue = 14 | pages = eaaz4888 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32284982 | pmc = 7124948 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.aaz4888 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2020SciA....6.4888C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, research investigating transport dynamics suggests that interactions between electronic and vibrational modes of excitation in FMO complexes require a semi-classical, semi-quantum explanation for the transfer of exciton energy.

[[Seth Lloyd]] is also notable for his contributions to this area of research.

=== DNA mutation===
[[DNA]] acts as the instructions for making proteins throughout the body. It consists of 4 nucleotides: guanine, thymine, cytosine, and adenine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/mutations_01|title=DNA and Mutations|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of these nucleotides gives the “recipe” for the different proteins.

Whenever a cell reproduces, it must copy these strands of DNA. However, sometimes throughout the process of copying the strand of DNA a mutation, or an error in the DNA code, can occur. A theory for the reasoning behind [[Mutation|DNA mutation]] is explained in the Lowdin DNA mutation model.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trixler F | title = Quantum Tunnelling to the Origin and Evolution of Life | journal = Current Organic Chemistry | volume = 17 | issue = 16 | pages = 1758–1770 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24039543 | pmc = 3768233 | doi = 10.2174/13852728113179990083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a nucleotide may spontaneously change its form through a process of [[Quantum tunnelling|quantum tunneling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slocombe L, Al-Khalili JS, Sacchi M | title = Quantum and classical effects in DNA point mutations: Watson-Crick tautomerism in AT and GC base pairs | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 4141–4150 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33533770 | doi = 10.1039/D0CP05781A | bibcode = 2021PCCP...23.4141S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Slocombe |first1=Louie |last2=Sacchi |first2=Marco |last3=Al-Khalili |first3=Jim |date=2022-05-05 |title=An open quantum systems approach to proton tunnelling in DNA |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-022-00881-8 |journal=Communications Physics |language=en |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=109 |doi=10.1038/s42005-022-00881-8 |arxiv=2110.00113 |bibcode=2022CmPhy...5..109S |s2cid=238253421 |issn=2399-3650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the changed nucleotide will lose its ability to pair with its original base pair and consequently changing the structure and order of the DNA strand.

Exposure to ultraviolet lights and other types of radiation can cause DNA mutation and damage. The radiations also can modify the bonds along the DNA strand in the [[pyrimidine]]s and cause them to bond with themselves creating a dimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Yu SL, Lee SK |title=Ultraviolet radiation: DNA damage, repair, and human disorders|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Toxicology|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1007/s13273-017-0002-0|issn=1738-642X|date=March 2017|s2cid=27532980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many prokaryotes and plants, these bonds are repaired to their original form by a DNA repair enzyme photolyase. As its prefix implies, photolyase is reliant on light in order to repair the strand. Photolyase works with its cofactor [[FADH]], flavin adenine dinucleotide, while repairing the DNA. Photolyase is excited by visible light and transfers an electron to the cofactor FADH-. FADH- now in the possession of an extra electron gives the electron to the dimer to break the bond and repair the DNA. This transfer of the electron is done through the tunneling of the electron from the FADH to the [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]. Although the range of the tunneling is much larger than feasible in a vacuum, the tunneling in this scenario is said to be “superexchange-mediated tunneling,” and is possible due to the protein's ability to boost the tunneling rates of the electron.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Vibration theory of olfaction ===
Olfaction, the sense of smell, can be broken down into two parts; the reception and detection of a chemical, and how that detection is sent to and processed by the brain. This process of detecting an [[Aroma compound|odorant]] is still under question. One theory named the “[[shape theory of olfaction]]” suggests that certain olfactory receptors are triggered by certain shapes of chemicals and those receptors send a specific message to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klopping HL | title = Olfactory theories and the odors of small molecules | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 999–1004 | date = May 1971 | pmid = 5134656 | doi = 10.1021/jf60177a002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory (based on quantum phenomena) suggests that the olfactory receptors detect the vibration of the molecules that reach them and the “smell” is due to different vibrational frequencies, this theory is aptly called the “vibration theory of olfaction.”

The [[vibration theory of olfaction]], created in 1938 by Malcolm Dyson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Malcolm Dyson G |date=1938-07-09|title=The scientific basis of odour|journal=Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry|language=en|volume=57|issue=28|pages=647–651|doi=10.1002/jctb.5000572802|issn=0368-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reinvigorated by Luca Turin in 1996,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turin L | title = A spectroscopic mechanism for primary olfactory reception | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 773–791 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8985605 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/21.6.773 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the mechanism for the sense of smell is due to G-protein receptors that detect molecular vibrations due to inelastic electron tunneling, tunneling where the electron loses energy, across molecules.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In this process a molecule would fill a binding site with a [[G protein-coupled receptor|G-protein]] receptor. After the binding of the chemical to the receptor, the chemical would then act as a bridge allowing for the electron to be transferred through the protein. As the electron transfers across what would otherwise have been a barrier, it loses energy due to the vibration of the newly-bound molecule to the receptor. This results in the ability to smell the molecule.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quantum effects in biology: golden"/&gt;

While the vibration theory has some experimental proof of concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2012-09-odorant-vibration-olfaction-satisfaction.html|title=Odorant shape and vibration likely lead to olfaction satisfaction|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.percepnet.com/documenta/Cell_1991.pdf|title=A Novel Multigene Family May Encode Odorant Receptors: A Molecular Basis for Odor Recognition|date=April 5, 1991|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been multiple controversial results in experiments. In some experiments, animals are able to distinguish smells between molecules of different frequencies and same structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Block E, Batista VS, Matsunami H, Zhuang H, Ahmed L | title = The role of metals in mammalian olfaction of low molecular weight organosulfur compounds | journal = Natural Product Reports | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 529–557 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28471462 | pmc = 5542778 | doi = 10.1039/c7np00016b }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other experiments show that people are unaware of distinguishing smells due to distinct molecular frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keller A, Vosshall LB | title = A psychophysical test of the vibration theory of olfaction | language = En | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–338 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15034588 | doi = 10.1038/nn1215 | s2cid = 1073550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vision ===
{{main|Visual phototransduction}}

Vision relies on quantized energy in order to convert light signals to an action potential in a process called [[Visual phototransduction|phototransduction]]. In phototransduction, a photon interacts with a [[chromophore]] in a light receptor. The chromophore absorbs the photon and undergoes [[photoisomerization]]. This change in structure induces a change in the structure of the photo receptor and resulting [[signal transduction]] pathways lead to a visual signal. However, the photoisomerization reaction occurs at a rapid rate, in under 200 [[femtosecond]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson PJ, Farag MH, Halpin A, Morizumi T, Prokhorenko VI, Knoester J, Jansen TL, Ernst OP, Miller RJ | display-authors = 6 | title = The Primary Photochemistry of Vision Occurs at the Molecular Speed Limit | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 121 | issue = 16 | pages = 4040–4047 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28358485 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b02329 | s2cid = 4837083 | url = https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/42527095/acs_2Ejpcb_2E7b02329.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; with high yield.

==== Quantum vision implications ====
Experiments have shown that the sensor in the retina of the human eye is sensitive enough to detect a single photon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.html|title=The Human Eye and Single Photons|website=math.ucr.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single [[photon]] detection could lead to multiple different technologies. One area of development is in quantum communication and [[cryptography]]. The idea is to use a biometric system to measure the eye using only a small number of points across the [[retina]] with random flashes of photons that “read” the retina and identify the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Quantum Biometrics with Retinal Photon Counting|journal= Physical Review Applied |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=044012|arxiv = 1704.04367 | vauthors = Loulakis M, Blatsios G, Vrettou CS, Kominis IK |year=2017|doi=10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044012|bibcode=2017PhRvP...8d4012L|s2cid= 119256067}}&lt;/ref&gt; This biometric system would only allow a certain individual with a specific retinal map to decode the message.

Particles, such as electrons and protons, have [[Wave–particle duality|wave-particle]] duality; they can pass through energy barriers due to their wave characteristics without violating the laws of physics. In order to quantify how quantum tunneling is used in many enzymatic activities, many biophysicists utilize the observation of hydrogen ions. When hydrogen ions are transferred, this is seen as a staple in an organelle's primary energy processing network; in other words, quantum effects are most usually at work in proton distribution sites at distances on the order of an [[angstrom]] (1 Å).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masgrau L, Roujeinikova A, Johannissen LO, Hothi P, Basran J, Ranaghan KE, Mulholland AJ, Sutcliffe MJ, Scrutton NS, Leys D | display-authors = 6 | title = Atomic description of an enzyme reaction dominated by proton tunneling | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5771 | pages = 237–241 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16614214 | doi = 10.1126/science.1126002 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312..237M | s2cid = 27201250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/294759396|title=Physical biology : from atoms to medicine|date=2008|publisher=Imperial College Press|others=Ahmed H.

==== Mitochondria ====
Organelles, such as [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], are thought to utilize [[Quantum tunnelling|quantum tunneling]] in order to translate intracellular energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunn AV, Guy GW, Bell JD | title = The quantum mitochondrion and optimal health | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1101–1110 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27528758 | pmc = 5264502 | doi = 10.1042/BST20160096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, mitochondria are known to generate most of the cell's energy in the form of chemical [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

Because tunneling is a quantum mechanism, it is important to understand how this process may occur for particle transfer in a biological system. Tunneling is largely dependent upon the shape and size of a potential barrier, relative to the incoming energy of a particle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arndt M, Juffmann T, Vedral V | title = Quantum physics meets biology | journal = HFSP Journal | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 386–400 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20234806 | pmc = 2839811 | doi = 10.2976/1.3244985 | arxiv = 0911.0155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the incoming particle can be defined by a wave equation, its tunneling probability is dependent upon the potential barrier's shape in an exponential way, meaning that if the barrier is akin to a very wide chasm, the incoming particle's probability to tunnel will decrease. The potential barrier, in some sense, can come in the form of an actual biomaterial barrier. Mitochondria are encompassed by a membrane structure that is akin to the cellular membrane, on the order of ~75 Å (~7.5&amp;nbsp;nm) thick.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The inner membrane of a mitochondria must be overcome to permit signals (in the form of electrons, protons, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to transfer from the site of emittance (internal to the mitochondria) and the site of acceptance (i.e. the electron transport chain proteins).&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Davies PC | chapter = A quantum origin of life? | title = Quantum aspects of life | date = January 2008 | pages = 3–18 | publisher = Imperial College Press | doi = 10.1142/9781848162556_0001 | isbn = 978-1-84816-253-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to transfer particles, the membrane of the mitochondria must have the correct density of phospholipids to conduct a relevant charge distribution that attracts the particle in question. For instance, for a greater density of phospholipids, the membrane contributes to a greater conductance of protons.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

More technically, the form of the mitochondria is the [[Mitochondrial matrix|matrix]], with inner mitochondrial membranes (IMM) and inner membrane spaces (IMS), all housing protein sites. Mitochondria produce ATP by the oxidation of hydrogen ions from carbohydrates and fats. This process utilizes electrons in an electron transport chain (ETP). The genealogy of electron transport proceeds as follows: Electrons from NADH are transferred to NADH dehydrogenase (complex I protein), which is located in the IMM.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman JR, Nunnari J | title = Mitochondrial form and function | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7483 | pages = 335–343 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24429632 | pmc = 4075653 | doi = 10.1038/nature12985 | bibcode = 2014Natur.505..335F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons from complex I are transferred to coenzyme Q to make CoQH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; next, electrons flow to cytochrome-containing IMM protein (complex III), which further pushes electrons to cytochrome c, where electrons flow to complex IV; complex IV is the final IMM protein complex of the ETC respiratory chain.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This final protein allows electrons to reduce oxygen from an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule to a single O, so that it can bind to the hydrogen ions to produce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The energy produced from the movement of electrons through the ETC induces proton movement (known as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pumping) out of the mitochondria matrix into the IMS.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Because any charge movement creates a magnetic field, the IMS now houses a capacitance across the matrix. The capacitance is akin to potential energy, or what is known as a potential barrier. This potential energy guides ATP synthesis via complex V (ATP synthase), which conflates ADP with another P to create ATP by pushing protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) back into the matrix (this process is known as [[oxidative phosphorylation]]). Finally, the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) houses a voltage-dependent anion channel called the [[Voltage-dependent anion channel|VDAC]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This site is important for converting energy signals into electro-chemical outputs for ATP transfer.

Cryptochrome, a [[flavoprotein]] found in the eyes of [[European robin]]s and other animal species, is the only protein known to form photoinduced radical-pairs in animals.&lt;ref name=Hore2016/&gt; When it interacts with light particles, cryptochrome goes through a [[redox]] reaction, which yields radical pairs both during the photo-reduction and the oxidation. The function of cryptochrome is diverse across species, however, the photoinduction of radical-pairs occurs by exposure to blue light, which excites an electron in a [[chromophore]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiltschko R, Ahmad M, Nießner C, Gehring D, Wiltschko W | title = Light-dependent magnetoreception in birds: the crucial step occurs in the dark | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 13 | issue = 118 | pages = 20151010 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27146685 | pmc = 4892254 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2015.1010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetoreception is also possible in the dark, so the mechanism must rely more on the radical pairs generated during light-independent oxidation.

Experiments in the lab support the basic theory that radical-pair electrons can be significantly influenced by very weak magnetic fields, i.e. merely the direction of weak magnetic fields can affect radical-pair's reactivity and therefore can "catalyze" the formation of chemical products. Whether this mechanism applies to magnetoreception and/or quantum biology, that is, whether earth's magnetic field "catalyzes" the formation of ''bio''chemical products by the aid of radical-pairs, is not fully clear. Radical-pairs may need not be entangled, the key ''quantum'' feature of the radical-pair mechanism, to play a part in these processes. There are entangled and non-entangled radical-pairs, but disturbing only entangled radical-pairs is not possible with current technology. Researchers found evidence for the radical-pair mechanism of magnetoreception when European robins, cockroaches, and garden warblers, could no longer navigate when exposed to a [[radio frequency]] that obstructs [[magnetic field]]s&lt;ref name=Hore2016/&gt; and radical-pair chemistry. Further evidence came from a comparison of [[Cryptochrome|Cryptochrome 4]] (CRY4) from migrating and non-migrating birds. CRY4 from chicken and pigeon were found to be less sensitive to magnetic fields than those from the (migrating) [[European robin]], suggesting evolutionary optimization of this protein as a sensor of  magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xu |first=Jingjing |last2=Jarocha |first2=Lauren E. |last3=Zollitsch |first3=Tilo |last4=Konowalczyk |first4=Marcin |last5=Henbest |first5=Kevin B. |last6=Richert |first6=Sabine |last7=Golesworthy |first7=Matthew J. |last8=Schmidt |first8=Jessica |last9=Déjean |first9=Victoire |last10=Sowood |first10=Daniel J.

=== Ferritin ===

[[Ferritin]] is an iron storage protein that is found in plants and animals.  It is usually formed from 24 subunits that self-assemble into a spherical shell that is approximately 2&amp;nbsp;nm thick, with an outer diameter that varies with iron loading up to about 16&amp;nbsp;nm.  Up to ~4500 iron atoms can be stored inside the core of the shell in the Fe3+ oxidation state as water-insoluble compounds such as [[ferrihydrite]] and [[magnetite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pan |first1=Ying-Hsi |last2=Sader |first2=Kasim |last3=Powell |first3=Jonathan J. |last4=Bleloch |first4=Andrew |last5=Gass |first5=Mhairi |last6=Trinick |first6=John |last7=Warley |first7=Alice |last8=Li |first8=Andy |last9=Brydson |first9=Rik |last10=Brown |first10=Andy |date=April 2009 |title=3D morphology of the human hepatic ferritin mineral core: New evidence for a subunit structure revealed by single particle analysis of HAADF-STEM images |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2008.12.001 |journal=Journal of Structural Biology |volume=166 |issue=1 |pages=22–31 |doi=10.1016/j.jsb.2008.12.001 |pmid=19116170 |pmc=2832756 |issn=1047-8477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferritin is able to store electrons for at least several hours, which reduce the Fe3+ to water soluble Fe2+.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wolszczak |first1=Marian |last2=Gajda |first2=Joanna |date=2010-08-17 |title=Iron release from ferritin induced by light and ionizing radiation |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11164-010-0155-0 |journal=Research on Chemical Intermediates |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=549–563 |doi=10.1007/s11164-010-0155-0 |s2cid=97639082 |issn=0922-6168}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum tunnelling|Electron tunneling]] as the mechanism by which electrons transit the 2&amp;nbsp;nm thick protein shell was proposed as early as 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Watt |first1=G D |last2=Jacobs |first2=D |last3=Frankel |first3=R B |date=October 1988 |title=Redox reactivity of bacterial and mammalian ferritin: is reductant entry into the ferritin interior a necessary step for iron release? |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=85 |issue=20 |pages=7457–7461 |doi=10.1073/pnas.85.20.7457 |pmid=2845407 |pmc=282210 |issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electron tunneling and other quantum mechanical properties of ferritin were observed in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Awschalom |first1=D.

{{for|the counting system|Quinary}}
The '''quinarian system''' was a method of [[Taxonomy (biology)|zoological classification]] which was popular in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[William Sharp Macleay]] in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Horae entomologicae: Essays on the Annulose Animals
|volume= 1|last=Macleay |first=W. S.|date=1819
|publisher=S. Bagster|place=London
|url=https://archive.org/details/horaeentomologic112macl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was further promoted in the works of [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]], [[William John Swainson]] and [[Johann Jakob Kaup]]. Swainson's work on [[ornithology]] gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), which paved the way for [[evolution]]ary trees.&lt;ref name=ohara&gt;{{cite book

==Classification approach==

[[Image:SwainsonQuinarian.jpg|thumb|Swainson's Quinarian structure of birds]]

Quinarianism gets its name from the emphasis on the number five: it proposed that all taxa are divisible into five subgroups, and if fewer than five subgroups were known, quinarians believed that a missing subgroup remained to be found.&lt;ref name=ohara/&gt;

[[Image:VigorsQuinarian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]]'s Quinarian classification of birds. The missing entries represented groups that he expected remained to be discovered.]]

Presumably this arose as a chance observation of some accidental analogies between different groups, but it was erected into a guiding principle by the quinarians. It became increasingly elaborate, proposing that each group of five classes could be arranged in a circle, with those closer together having greater affinities. Typically they were depicted with relatively advanced groups at the top, and supposedly degenerate forms towards the bottom. Each circle could touch or overlap with adjacent circles; the equivalent overlapping of actual groups in nature was called osculation&lt;!--don't link to the mathematics page of this name--&gt;.

[[Image:PtilotaQuinarian.jpg|thumb|[[William John Swainson]]'s arrangement of the insects, with analogies to the vertebrates]]

Another aspect of the system was the identification of ''analogies'' across groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= O’Hara, Robert J. |year=1991| title=Representations of the natural system in the nineteenth century| journal= Biology and Philosophy|volume= 6| issue=2| pages=255–274| url=http://rjohara.net/cv/1991-bp.html| doi=10.1007/bf02426840|s2cid=170994228}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[W]e shall consider that to be a natural system which endeavours to explain the multifarious relations which one object bears to another, not simply in their direct affinity, by which they follow each other like the links of a vast chain, but in their more remote relations [analogies], whereby they typify or represent other objects totally distinct in structure and organization from themselves|Swainson, 1835:197&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Swainson, W.|year=1835| title= A treatise on the geography and classification of animals| publisher= Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Greene and Longman, and John Taylor |location=London |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97034t }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Quinarianism was not widely popular outside the United Kingdom (some followers like William Hincks persisted in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=35|pages= 5–42 |year= 2002| title= Quinarianism after Darwin's Origin: The Circular System of William Hincks| author=Coggon, Jennifer|doi=10.1023/a:1014582710287|s2cid=82113739}}&lt;/ref&gt;); it became unfashionable by the 1840s, during which time more complex "maps" were made by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. Strickland and others specifically rejected the use of relations of "analogy" in constructing natural classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Strickland, H.E. |year=1841 |title= On the true method of discovering the natural system in zoology and botany| journal= Annals and Magazine of Natural History|volume= 6|issue=36 |pages=184–194 |url=https://archive.org/stream/annalsmagazineof06londuoft#page/184/mode/1up |doi=10.1080/03745484009443283}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems were eventually discarded in favour of principles of genuinely natural classification, namely based on [[evolution]]ary relationship.&lt;ref name=ohara/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Panchen, Alec L. |year=1992| title=Classification, Evolution, and the Nature of Biology|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At low pH, Type 51 R bodies undergo a dramatic structural rearrangement. Much like a [[Chinese yo-yo|paper yo-yo]], the ribbon extends (from the center) to form hollow tube with pointed ends that can reach up to 20μm in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preer|first=John R.|last2=Hufnagel|first2=Linda A.|last3=Preer|first3=Louise B.|date=1966-04-01|title=Structure and behavior of R bodies from killer paramecia|journal=Journal of Ultrastructure Research|volume=15|issue=1|pages=131–143|doi=10.1016/S0022-5320(66)80100-4|pmid=5936490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of R bodies from different bacterial species vary in their size, ribbon morphology, and triggers for extension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Function ==
When [[kappa particle]]s shed from a killer paramecium are ingested, R bodies extend within the acidic food vacuole of the predatory paramecium, distending and rupturing the membrane.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Jo Anne|date=1965-12-01|title=Vitally stained kappa in Paramecium aurelia|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|language=en|volume=160|issue=3|pages=369–372|doi=10.1002/jez.1401600314|pmid=4160786|issn=1097-010X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liberates the contents of the food vacuole into the cytoplasm of the paramecium.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While feeding kappa particles to sensitive paramecium results in the death of paramecium, feeding purified R bodies or R bodies recombinantly expressed in ''E. coli'' is not toxic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrallhammer|first=Martina|last2=Galati|first2=Stefano|last3=Altenbuchner|first3=Josef|last4=Schweikert|first4=Michael|last5=Görtz|first5=Hans-Dieter|last6=Petroni|first6=Giulio|date=2012-11-01|title=Tracing the role of R-bodies in the killer trait: absence of toxicity of R-body producing recombinant E. coli on paramecia|journal=European Journal of Protistology|volume=48|issue=4|pages=290–296|doi=10.1016/j.ejop.2012.01.008|issn=1618-0429|pmid=22356923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, R bodies are thought to function as a toxin delivery system.

R bodies are also capable of rupturing ''E. coli'' [[spheroplast]]s, demonstrating that they can rupture membranes in a foreign context, and they can be engineered to extend at a variety of different pH levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polka|first=Jessica K.|last2=Silver|first2=Pamela A.|date=2016-04-15|title=A Tunable Protein Piston That Breaks Membranes to Release Encapsulated Cargo|journal=ACS Synthetic Biology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=303–311|doi=10.1021/acssynbio.5b00237|pmid=26814170|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rabbit [[Hybridoma technology|hybridoma]]''' is a hybrid cell line formed by the fusion of an antibody producing rabbit [[B cell]] with a cancerous B-cell ([[myeloma]]).

== History ==
The rabbit immune system has been documented as a vehicle for developing [[antibodies]] with higher [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] and more diverse recognition of many molecules including phospho-peptides, carbohydrates and immunogens that are not otherwise [[Immunogenicity|immunogenic]] in mouse.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raybould TJ, Takahashi M | title = Production of stable rabbit-mouse hybridomas that secrete rabbit mAb of defined specificity | journal = Science | volume = 240 | issue = 4860 | pages = 1788–90 | date = June 1988 | pmid = 3289119 | doi = 10.1126/science.3289119 | bibcode = 1988Sci...240.1788R }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, until recently, the type of antibodies available from rabbit had been limited in scope to [[polyclonal antibodies]].  Several efforts were made to generate rabbit [[monoclonal antibodies]] after the development of mouse [[hybridoma technology]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins JJ, Black PH, Strosberg AD, Haber E, Bloch KJ | title = Transformation by simian virus 40 of spleen cells from a hyperimmune rabbit: evidence for synthesis of immunoglobulin by the transformed cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 260–2 | date = February 1974 | pmid = 4150020 | pmc = 387981 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.71.2.260 | bibcode = 1974PNAS...71..260C | jstor = 62751 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was conducted into mouse-rabbit hetero-hybridomas to make rabbit monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuo MC, Sogn JA, Max EE, Kindt TJ | title = Rabbit-mouse hybridomas secreting intact rabbit immunoglobulin | journal = Molecular Immunology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 351–9 | date = April 1985 | pmid = 4033662 | doi = 10.1016/0161-5890(85)90119-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these hetero-hybridomas were ultimately difficult to clone, and the clones, generally unstable, and did not secrete antibody over a prolonged period of time.

== Initial fusion partner ==
In 1995, Katherine Knight and her colleagues, at Loyola University of Chicago, succeeded in developing a double transgenic rabbit over-expressing the oncogenes v-abl and c-myc under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain enhancers. The rabbit formed a myeloma-like tumor, allowing the isolation of a plasmacytoma cell line, named 240E-1. Fusion of 240E-1 cells with rabbit lymphocytes produced hybridomas that secreted rabbit monoclonal antibodies in a consistent manner.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spieker-Polet H, Sethupathi P, Yam PC, Knight KL | title = Rabbit monoclonal antibodies: generating a fusion partner to produce rabbit-rabbit hybridomas | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 20 | pages = 9348–52 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 7568130 | pmc = 40982 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.20.9348 | bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.9348S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, like the early mouse myeloma lines developed in the 1970s, stability was a concern.  A number of laboratories which had received the 240E-1 cell line from Dr. Knight’s laboratory reported stability problems with the fusion cell line 240E-1.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liguori MJ, Hoff-Velk JA, Ostrow DH | title = Recombinant human interleukin-6 enhances the immunoglobulin secretion of a rabbit-rabbit hybridoma | journal = Hybridoma | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 189–98 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11461668 | doi = 10.1089/027245701750293529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improved fusion partner ==
In 1996, Weimin Zhu and Robert Pytela, at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), obtained 240E-1 from Dr. Knight’s laboratory and attempted to develop an improved rabbit hybridoma.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; Improvements in the characteristics of 240E-1 were accomplished by repeated subcloning, selection for high fusion efficiency, robust growth, and morphological characteristics such as a bright appearance under a [[phase-contrast microscope]]. Selected subclones were further tested for their ability to produce a stable hybridoma and monoclonal antibody secretion. After multiple rounds of subcloning and selection processes, a new cell line named 240E-W, was identified and which expressed better fusion efficiency and stability. Cell line 240E-W has since been further developed and optimized for production of rabbit monoclonal antibodies for research and commercial applications.

== Process ==
The process of hybridoma formation in a rabbit first entails obtaining [[B cell|B-cells]] from a rabbit that has been immunized.  There are numerous immunization protocols for rabbit, notably for the generation of polyclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Howard GC, Kaser MR | isbn = 9780849335280 | title = Making and using antibodies: a practical handbook.  | publisher = CRC Press | date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harlow E, Lane D | title = Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual | isbn = 978-1-936113-81-1 | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | date = 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Coligan JE, Kruisbeek AM, etal | title = Current protocols in immunology | publisher = Greene and Wiley | date = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   After immunization, B-cells are fused with a candidate rabbit fusion partner cell line to form hybridomas. Resulting antibodies from hybridomas are screened for an antigen which meets criteria of interest by diagnostic tests such as [[ELISA]], [[Western blot]], [[Immunohistochemistry]] and FACS. The resulting hybrdomas may be subcloned to ensure monoclonal characteristics. 

== Humanization of rabbit antibodies ==
Mitchell Ho and Ira Pastan at National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, USA) isolated a group of rabbit monoclonal antibodies (e.g. YP218, YP223) that recognize rare epitopes of mesothelin, including poorly immunogenic sites close to the C terminal end, for cancer therapy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang YF, Phung Y, Gao W, Kawa S, Hassan R, Pastan I, Ho M | title = New high affinity monoclonal antibodies recognize non-overlapping epitopes on mesothelin for monitoring and treating mesothelioma | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 9928 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25996440 | pmc = 4440525 | doi = 10.1038/srep09928 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...5E9928Z }} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Ho's laboratory analyzed the complex structures of rabbit antibodies with their antigens from the Protein Data Bank, and identified antigen-contacting residues on the rabbit Fv within the 6 Angstrom distance to its antigen.&lt;ref name="Zhang Ho 2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang YF, Ho M | title = Humanization of rabbit monoclonal antibodies via grafting combined Kabat/IMGT/Paratome complementarity-determining regions: Rationale and examples | journal = mAbs | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–429 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28165915 | pmc = 5384799 | doi = 10.1080/19420862.2017.1289302 }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; They named "HV4" and "LV4", non-complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops that are structurally close to the antigen and located in framework 3 of the rabbit heavy chain and light chain, respectively. Based on the structural analysis, they designed a humanization strategy by grafting the combined Kabat/IMGT/Paratome CDRs into a human germline framework sequence. The immunotoxins composed of the humanized rabbit Fvs (e.g. hYP218) fused to a clinically used toxin showed stronger cytotoxicity against tumor cells than the immunotoxins derived from their original rabbit Fvs. The CAR T cells based on the hYP218 antibody show effective inhibition of tumor growth in mice. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Z, Jiang D, Yang H, He Z, Liu X, Qin W, Li L, Wang C, Li Y, Li H, Xu H, Jin H, Qian Q | display-authors = 6 | title = Modified CAR T cells targeting membrane-proximal epitope of mesothelin enhances the antitumor function against large solid tumor | journal = Cell Death &amp; Disease | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 476 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31209210 | pmc = 6572851 | doi = 10.1038/s41419-019-1711-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method (i.e. grafting combined Kabat/IMGT/Paratome rabbit CDRs to a stable human germline framework) has been suggested as a general approach to humanize rabbit antibodies.&lt;ref name="Zhang Ho 2017"/&gt;

      <text bytes="3909" xml:space="preserve">'''Radar ornithology''' is the use of [[radar]] technology in studies of bird migration and in approaches to prevent [[bird strike]]s particularly to aircraft. The technique was developed from the observations of pale wisps seen moving on radar during the Second World War. These were termed as "angels", "ghosts", or "phantoms" in Britain and were later identified as being caused by migrating birds. Over time, the technology has been vastly improved with Doppler [[weather radar]]s that allow the detection of birds, bats, as well as insects with resolution and sensitivity that is sufficient to quantify the speed of flaps that can sometimes aid in the identification of species.

==History ==
According to [[David Lack]], the earliest recorded use of radar in detecting birds came in 1940. The movements of gulls, herons and lapwings that caused some of the detentions was visually confirmed. It was however only in the 1950s through the work of [[Ernst Sutter]] at Zurich airport that more elusive "angels" were confirmed to be caused by small passerines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sutter, Ernst|year=1957| title=Radar als Hilfsmittel der Vogelzugforschung|journal=Orn. Beob.| volume=54| pages=70–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Lack was one of the pioneers of radar ornithology in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/156446a0|title=Detection of Birds by Radar|journal=Nature|volume=156|issue=3963|pages=446|year=1945|last1=Lack|first1=David|last2=Varley|first2=G. C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Early radar ornithology mainly focused, due to limitations of the equipment, on the seasonality, timing, intensity, and direction of flocks of birds in migration. Modern weather radars can detect the wing area of the flying, the speed of flight, the frequency of wing beat, the direction, distance and altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1109/APS.2009.5172069|chapter=A review of radar techniques for ornithological observations|title=2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium|pages=1–4|year=2009|last1=Junwei Dong|last2=Zaghloul|first2=Amir I|isbn=978-1-4244-3647-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity and modern analytical techniques now allows detection of flying insects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/JTECH2038.1|title=Discrimination of Bird and Insect Radar Echoes in Clear Air Using High-Resolution Radars|journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology|volume=24|issue=7|pages=1215–1230|year=2007|last1=Martin|first1=William J|last2=Shapiro|first2=Alan|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radial immunodiffusion''' (RID) or Mancini method, Mancini immunodiffusion or single radial immunodiffusion assay, is an [[immunodiffusion]] technique used in [[immunology]] to determine the quantity or [[concentration]] of an [[antigen]] in a sample.

== Description ==

=== Preparation ===
A solution containing [[antibody]] is added to a heated medium such as [[agar]] or [[agarose]] dissolved in [[Buffer solution|buffered]] [[Saline (medicine)#Normal|normal saline]]. The molten medium is then poured onto a [[microscope slide]] or into an open container, such as a [[Petri dish]], and allowed to cool and form a [[gel]]. A solution containing the antigen is then placed in a well that is punched into the gel. The slide or container is then covered, closed or placed in a humidity box to prevent evaporation.&lt;ref name=Berne1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170808075613/http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/clinchem/20/1/61.full.pdf Berne (1974).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis|first1=Neil C.|first2=Monto|last2=Ho|name-list-style=vanc|year=1976|chapter=Chapter 2: Quantitation of Immunoglobulins: Radial Immunodiffusion|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/manualofclinical00rose/page/4/|editor1-last=Rose|editor1-first=Noel|editor2-last=Friedman|editor2-first=Herman|title=Manual of Clinical Immunology|url=https://archive.org/details/manualofclinical00rose/page/n6/mode/1up|pages=5–8|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[American Society for Microbiology]]|url-access=registration|isbn=0-914826-09-3|oclc=1036571523|lccn=76017595|access-date=2019-06-14|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;[https://archive.org/details/essentialsofimmu0000stan/page/172/mode/2up Stanley (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSUMC&gt;[http://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/microbiology/DMIP/dmex03.htm LSUMC/MIP Dental Microbiology Lab (2002).]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The antigen [[diffusion|diffuses]] radially into the medium, forming a circle of [[precipitin]] that marks the boundary between the antibody and the antigen.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt; The [[diameter]] of the circle increases with time as the antigen diffuses into the medium, reacts with the antibody, and forms insoluble [[Immune complex|precipitin complexes]].&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini&gt;(1) {{cite journal|vauthors = Mancini G, Carbonara AO, Heremans JF |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0019279165900042|title = Immunochemical quantitation of antigens by single radial immunodiffusion| journal = Immunochemistry|volume=2|issue = 3|pages=235–254|date=September 1965|place=[[Oxford]], [[England]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|pmid = 4956917|doi=10.1016/0019-2791(65)90004-2|lccn=64009461|issn=0019-2791|oclc =53097967|accessdate=2020-07-08|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite book | vauthors = Mancini G, Vaerman JP, Carbonara AO, Heremans JF | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dYvAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22single-radial-diffusion+method%22|title=A single–radial–diffusion method for the immunological quantitation of proteins |editor=Peeters, Hubert|work=Protides of the Biological Fluids: Proceedings of the 11th Colloquium, [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]] (1963) |date=December 1964|pages=370–373|place=[[Amsterdam]], [[The Netherlands]]|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|oclc=25285708|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2020-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antigen is quantitated by measuring the diameter of the precipitin circle and comparing it with the diameters of precipitin circles formed by known quantities or concentrations of the antigen.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parvez&gt;{{cite book|last=Parvez|first=Zaheer| name-list-style=vanc|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-7225-1_5|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4615-7225-1|title=Immunoassays in Coagulation Testing|chapter=Chapter 4: Review of Immunologic Techniques: Radial Immunodiffusion (RID)|pages=21–22|location=New York|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year=1984|lccn=83020115|oclc=851823206|isbn=9781461572251|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-7225-1_5|accessdate=2020-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708080123/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-7225-1_5|archive-date=2020-07-08|url-status=live}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immune complex|Antigen-antibody complexes]] are small and soluble when in antigen excess. Therefore, precipitation near the center of the circle is usually less dense than it is near the circle's outer edge, where antigen is less concentrated.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;

Expansion of the circle reaches an [[wikt:endpoint|endpoint]] and stops when free antigen is depleted and when antigen and antibody reach equivalence.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt; However, the clarity and density of the circle's outer edge may continue to increase after the circle stops expanding.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;

=== Interpretation ===
[[File:Absolute myocardial blood flow.png|thumb|right|upright=1.0|Best-fit line plots. RID often produces similar plots when the horizontal [[Abscissa and ordinate|abcissa (X-axis)]] contains the initial antigen concentrations, the vertical [[Abscissa and ordinate|ordinate (Y-axis)]] contains the squares of the precipitin ring diameters, and each plot is a measurement time. The entirely curved purple plot (bottom) appears when all rings are expanding. The entirely straight red plot (top) appears when all rings have reached their endpoints and have stopped expanding. Intermediate plots are partially straight and partially curved (see &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170808075613/http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/clinchem/20/1/61.full.pdf Berne (1974)], p. 65, Fig. 4; p. 66, text: "In Figure 4, the squares of diameters are plotted as a linear ordinate and the concentrations as a linear abscissa ..... here, linearity appears in progressively larger portions of the curve, corresponding to cessation of growth. The plot is linear over the entire range at equivalence; ...."&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/essentialsofimmu0000stan/page/174/mode/1up Stanley (2002), p. 174, Fig. 12-6.]&lt;/ref&gt;).]]
For most antigens, the [[area]] and the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the diameter of the circle at the circle's endpoint are [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Direct proportionality|directly proportional]] to the initial quantity of antigen and are [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the concentration of antibody.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt; Therefore, a [[Plot (graphics)|graph]] that compares the quantities or concentrations of antigen in the original samples with the areas or the squares of the diameters of the precipitin circles on a [[Line chart#Best-fit|best-fit line plot]] will usually be a straight line after all circles have reached their endpoints (equivalence method).&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parvez/&gt;

Circles that small quantities of antigen create reach their endpoints before circles that large quantities create do so.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt; Therefore, if areas or diameters of circles are measured while some, but not all, circles have stopped expanding, such a graph will be straight in the portion whose wells initially contained the smaller quantities or concentrations of antigen and will be curved in the portion whose wells contained the larger quantities or concentrations.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt;

While circles are still expanding, a graph that compares the initial quantities or concentrations of the antigen on a [[logarithmic scale]] with the diameters or areas of the circles on a linear scale may be a straight line (kinetic method).&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=LSUMC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parvez/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14253527"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fahey JL, McKelvey EM|title=Quantitative determination of serum immunoglobulins in antibody–agar plates|journal=[[Journal of Immunology]]|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.]]|volume=94|issue=1|pages=84–90|date=1965-01-01|pmid=14253527|url= http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/reprint/94/1/84.pdf|lccn=52052893|issn=0022-1767|oclc=802743767|access-date=2007-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225120025/https://www.jimmunol.org/content/94/1/84|archive-date=2018-02-25|url-status=live}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, circles of the precipitate are smaller and less distinct during expansion than they are after expansion has ended.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt; Further, temperature affects the rate of expansion, but does not affect the size of a circle at its endpoint.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt; In addition, the range of circle diameters for the same initial quantities or concentrations of antigen is smaller while some circles are enlarging than they are after all circles have reached their endpoints.&lt;ref name=Berne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mancini/&gt;

Determine the concentration of the unknown test serum by drawing a Standard Curve - plotting the known concentrations of the reference sera versus their diffusion diameters on 2-cycle semi-log paper (see example).&lt;br /&gt;7. The plot of the reference sera data should give a STRAIGHT LINE, and the concentration of the IgG in the test serum can be accurately determined."&lt;/ref&gt;).]]
One can determine the antigen concentration in a sample whose concentration is unknown by finding its location on a graph that charts the diameters of precipitin circles produced by three or more reference samples with known antigen concentrations. Two techniques often produce straight lines on such graphs. The techniques produce those lines on different types of graphs.

The techniques and their graphs are: 
* Measuring circles while all are expanding (kinetic method): graph charting logarithms of initial antigen concentrations vs. diameters of precipitin circles on a best-fit [[Semi-log plot|semi-logarithmic plot]].&lt;ref name=LSUMC/&gt;
* Measuring circles after all reach their end points (equivalence method): graph charting initial antigen concentrations vs. squares of diameters of precipitin circles on a [[Line chart#Best-fit|best-fit line plot]].&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;

In [[chemistry]], a '''radical''', also known as a '''free radical''', is an [[atom]], [[molecule]], or [[ion]] that has at least one [[unpaired electron|unpaired valence electron]].&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05066.html ''radical (free radical)''] [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/R05066.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302220258/http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05066.html |date=2017-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayyan | first1 = M. | last2 = Hashim | first2 = M.A. | last3 = Anjkut| first3 = I.M. | year = 2016 | title = Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 116 | issue = 5| pages = 3029–85 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407 | pmid = 26875845 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With some exceptions, these unpaired electrons make radicals highly [[chemical reaction|chemically reactive]].  Many radicals spontaneously [[dimer (chemistry)|dimerize]].  Most organic radicals have short lifetimes.

A notable example of a radical is the [[hydroxyl radical]] (HO'''·'''), a molecule that has one unpaired electron on the oxygen atom. Two other examples are [[triplet oxygen]] and [[methylene radical|triplet carbene]] ('''꞉'''{{chem|CH|2}}) which have two unpaired electrons.

Radicals may be generated in a number of ways, but typical methods involve [[redox reaction]]s. [[Ionizing radiation]], heat, electrical discharges, and [[electrolysis]] are known to produce radicals. Radicals are intermediates in many chemical reactions, more so than is apparent from the balanced equations.

Radicals are important in [[combustion]], [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[polymerization]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] chemistry, [[biochemistry]], and many other chemical processes. A majority of natural products are generated by radical-generating enzymes.  In living organisms, the radicals [[superoxide]] and [[nitric oxide]] and their reaction products regulate many processes, such as control of vascular tone and thus blood pressure. They also play a key role in the intermediary metabolism of various biological compounds. Such radicals can even be messengers in a process dubbed [[redox signaling]].  A radical may be trapped within a [[Cage effect (chemistry)|solvent cage]] or be otherwise bound.

== Formation==
Radicals are either (1) formed from spin-paired molecules or (2) from other radicals. Radicals are formed from spin-paired molecules through homolysis of weak bonds or electron transfer, also known as reduction. Radicals are formed from other radicals through substitution, addition, and elimination reactions.
[[File:Brominehomolysis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Homolysis of a bromine molecule producing two bromine radicals]]

===Radical formation from spin-paired molecules===

====Homolysis====
[[File:Homolysis2.png|thumb|upright=1.95|Homolysis of dibenzoyl peroxide producing two benzoyloxy radicals]]
[[Homolysis (chemistry)|Homolysis]] makes two new radicals from a spin-paired molecule by breaking a covalent bond, leaving each of the fragments with one of the electrons in the bond.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Because breaking a chemical bond requires energy, homolysis occurs under the addition of heat or light. The [[Bond-dissociation energy|bond dissociation energy]] associated with homolysis depends on the stability of a given compound, and some weak bonds are able to homolyze at relatively lower temperatures.

Some homolysis reactions are particularly important because they serve as an initiator for other radical reactions. One such example is the homolysis of halogens, which occurs under light and serves as the driving force for radical halogenation reactions.

Another notable reaction is the homolysis of dibenzoyl peroxide, which results in the formation of two benzoyloxy radicals and acts as an initiator for many radical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Diacyl Peroxides|url=https://polymerdatabase.com/polymer%20chemistry/Diaroyl%20Peroxides.html|access-date=2020-12-08|website=polymerdatabase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ketonereduction.png|thumb|Reduction of a ketone to form a ketyl radical|upright=1.25|link=Special:FilePath/Radicalreduction.png]]

====Reduction====
Radicals can also form when a single electron is added to a spin-paired molecule, resulting in an electron transfer. This reaction, also called reduction, usually takes place with an alkali metal donating an electron to another spin-paired molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-01-21|title=IV. Nonchain Reactions: Radical Formation by Electron Transfer|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Radical_Reactions_of_Carbohydrates_(Binkley)/II%3A_Radical_Reactions_of_Carbohydrates/18%3A_Compounds_with_Carbon%E2%80%93Carbon_Multiple_Bonds_I%3A_Addition_Reactions/IV._Nonchain_Reactions%3A_Radical_Formation_by_Electron_Transfer|access-date=2020-12-08|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical formation from other radicals===

====Abstraction====
[[File:Abstraction.png|thumb|upright=1.95|Radical abstraction between a benzoyloxy radical and hydrogen bromide]]

[[File:radicaladdition.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Radical addition of a bromine radical to a substituted alkene]]
[[Hydrogen atom abstraction|Hydrogen abstraction]] describes when a hydrogen atom is removed from a hydrogen donor molecule (e.g. tin or silicon hydride) with its one electron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-01-11|title=II. Atom Abstraction|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Radical_Reactions_of_Carbohydrates_(Binkley)/I%3A_Structure_and_Reactivity_of_Carbohydrate__Radicals/04%3A_Elementary_Reactions/02._Atom_Abstraction|access-date=2020-12-08|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstraction produces a new radical and a new spin-paired molecule. This is different from homolysis, which results in two radicals from a single spin-paired molecule and doesn’t include a radical as its reactant. Hydrogen abstraction is a fundamental process in radical chemistry because it serves as the final propagation step in many chemical reactions, converting carbon radicals into stable molecules. The figure to the right shows a radical abstraction between a benzoyloxy radical and a hydrogen bromide molecule, resulting in the production of a benzoic acid molecule and a bromine radical.

====Addition====
[[Free-radical addition|Radical addition]] describes when a radical is added to a spin-paired molecule to form a new radical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2013-10-02|title=Radical Additions: Anti-Markovnikov Product Formation|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Alkenes/Reactivity_of_Alkenes/Free_Radical_Reactions_of_Alkenes/Radical_Additions%3A_Anti-Markovnikov_Product_Formation|access-date=2020-12-08|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure on the right shows the addition of a bromine radical to an alkene. Radical addition follows the [[Markovnikov's rule|Anti -Markovnikov rule]], where the substituent is added to the less substituted carbon atom.

====Elimination====
Radical elimination can be viewed as the reverse of radical addition. In radical elimination, an unstable radical compound breaks down into a spin-paired molecule and a new radical compound. Shown below is an example of a radical elimination reaction, where a benzoyloxy radical breaks down into a phenyl radical and a carbon dioxide molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Su|first=Wei-Fang|title=Radical Chain Polymerization|date=2013|work=Principles of Polymer Design and Synthesis|pages=137–183|editor-last=Su|editor-first=Wei-Fang|series=Lecture Notes in Chemistry|volume=82|place=Berlin, Heidelberg|publisher=Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38730-2_7|isbn=978-3-642-38730-2|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although organic radicals are generally stable intrinsically (in isolation), practically speaking their existence is only transient because they tend to dimerize. Some are quite long-lived. Generally organic radicals are stabilized by any or all of these factors: presence of electronegativity, delocalization, and steric hindrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar50097a003|title=Persistent carbon-centered radicals|year=1976|last1=Griller|first1=David|first2=Keith U.|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=9|pages=13–19|last2=Ingold}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The compound [[TEMPO|2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl]] illustrates the combination of all three factors.  It is a commercially available solid that, aside from being magnetic, behaves like a normal organic compound.

==== Electronegativity ====
Organic radicals are inherently electron deficient thus the greater the electronegativity of the atom on which the unpaired electron resides the less stable the radical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Forrester|first=A.R.|title=Organic Chemistry of Stable Free Radicals|publisher=London: Academic Press|year=1968|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, for example, carbon is the most stable and oxygen the least stable. 

Electronegativity also factors into the stability of carbon atoms of different hybridizations. Greater s-character correlates to higher electronegativity of the carbon atom (due to the close proximity of s orbitals to the nucleus), and the greater the electronegativity the less stable a radical.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; sp-hybridized carbons (50% s-character) form the least stable radicals compared to sp3-hybridized carbons (25% s-character) which form the most stable radicals.

==== Delocalization ====
The delocalization of electrons across the structure of a radical, also known as its ability to form one or more resonance structures, allows for the electron-deficiency to be spread over several atoms, minimizing instability. Delocalization usually occurs in the presence of electron-donating groups, such as hydroxyl groups (−OH), ethers (−OR), adjacent alkenes, and amines (−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or −NR), or electron-withdrawing groups, such as C=O or C≡N.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clayden, Jonathan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/761379371|title=Organic chemistry|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|last2=Greeves |first2=Nick |last3=Warren |first3=Stuart G.|isbn=978-0-19-927029-3|edition=2nd |location=Oxford|oclc=761379371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electron-Donating Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Molecular orbital diagram of a radical with an electron-donating group]]
Delocalization effects can also be understood using [[molecular orbital theory]] as a lens, more specifically, by examining the intramolecular interaction of the unpaired electron with a donating group’s pair of electrons or the empty π* orbital of an electron-withdrawing group in the form of a molecular orbital diagram. The HOMO of a radical is singly-occupied hence the orbital is aptly referred to as the SOMO, or the Singly-Occupied Molecular Orbital. For an electron-donating group, the SOMO interacts with the lower energy lone pair to form a new lower-energy filled bonding-orbital and a singly-filled new SOMO, higher in energy than the original. While the energy of the unpaired electron has increased, the decrease in energy of the lone pair forming the new bonding orbital outweighs the increase in energy of the new SOMO, resulting in a net decrease of the energy of the molecule. Therefore, electron-donating groups help stabilize radicals.
[[File:Electron-Withdrawing Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Molecular orbital diagram of a radical with an electron-withdrawing group]]
With a group that is instead electron-withdrawing, the SOMO then interacts with the empty π* orbital. There are no electrons occupying the higher energy orbital formed, while a new SOMO forms that is lower in energy. This results in a lower energy and higher stability of the radical species. Both donating groups and withdrawing groups stabilize radicals.
[[File:Tert,Sec,Prim Drawing.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|The relative stabilities of tertiary, secondary, primary and methyl radicals.]]
Another well-known albeit weaker form of delocalization is [[hyperconjugation]]. In radical chemistry, radicals are stabilized by hyperconjugation with adjacent alkyl groups. The donation of sigma (σ) C−H bonds into the partially empty radical orbitals helps to differentiate the stabilities of radicals on tertiary, secondary, and primary carbons. Tertiary carbon radicals have three σ C-H bonds that donate, secondary radicals only two, and primary radicals only one. Therefore, tertiary radicals are the most stable and primary radicals the least stable.

==== Steric hindrance ====
[[File:N-hydroxypiperidine Radical Form.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|Radical form of [[N-Hydroxypiperidine|''N''-hydroxypiperidine]]]]
Most simply, the greater the steric hindrance the more difficult it is for reactions to take place, and the radical form is favored by default. For example, compare the hydrogen-abstracted form of [[N-Hydroxypiperidine|''N''-hydroxypiperidine]] to the molecule [[TEMPO]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; TEMPO, or (2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl, is too sterically hindered by the additional methyl groups to react making it stable enough to be sold commercially in its radical form. ''N''-Hydroxypiperidine, however, does not have the four methyl groups to impede the way of a reacting molecule so the structure is unstable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Facile H-atom donors====
The stability of many (or most) organic radicals is not indicated by their isolability but is manifested in their ability to function as donors of H&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;.  This property reflects a weakened bond to hydrogen, usually O−H but sometimes N−H or C−H.  This behavior is important because these H&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; donors serve as antioxidants in biology and in commerce.  Illustrative is [[tocopherol|α-tocopherol]] ([[vitamin E]]). The tocopherol radical itself is insufficiently stable for isolation, but the parent molecule is a highly effective hydrogen-atom donor. The C−H bond is weakened in [[triphenylmethyl]] (trityl) derivatives.  
[[image:2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[TEMPO|2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl]] is an example of a robust organic radical.]]

==Inorganic radicals==
A large variety of inorganic radicals are stable and in fact isolable.  Examples include most first-row transition metal complexes. 

With regard to main group radicals, the most abundant radical in the universe is also the most abundant chemical in the universe, H&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;.  Most main group radicals are not however ''isolable'', despite their intrinsic stability.  Hydrogen radicals for example combine eagerly to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  [[Nitric oxide]] (NO) is well known example of an isolable inorganic radical.  [[Fremy's salt]] (Potassium nitrosodisulfonate, (KSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NO) is a related example. Many [[Tetrasulfur tetranitride|thiazyl]] radicals are known, despite limited extent of π [[resonance stabilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Oakley | first1 = Richard T. | title = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 36 | pages = 299–391 | year = 1988 | doi = 10.1002/9780470166376.ch4 | chapter-url = http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/oakley/papers/rto_086.pdf | department = Cyclic and Heterocyclic Thiazenes (section) | series = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-470-16637-6 | chapter = Cyclic and Heterocyclic Thiazenes | access-date = 2011-03-31 | archive-date = 2015-09-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202507/http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/oakley/papers/rto_086.pdf | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rawson | first1 = J | last2 = Banister | first2 = A | last3 = Lavender | first3 = I | title = Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry | volume = 62 | pages = 137–247 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2725(08)60422-5 | department = The Chemistry of Dithiadiazolylium and Dithiadiazolyl Rings (section) =  | series = Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-12-020762-6  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many radicals can be envisioned as the products of [[Bond cleavage|breaking of covalent bonds]] by [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. The homolytic [[Bond dissociation energy|bond dissociation energies]], usually abbreviated as "Δ''H''{{px1}}°" are a measure of bond strength. Splitting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, requires a Δ''H''{{px1}}° of +435 [[Joule per mole|kJ/mol]], while splitting Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into two Cl&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; requires a Δ''H''{{px1}}° of +243 kJ/mol.  For weak bonds, homolysis can be induced thermally.  Strong bonds require high energy photons or even flames to induce homolysis.

==Diradicals==
[[Diradical]]s are molecules containing two radical centers. [[Dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an important example of a stable diradical. [[Singlet oxygen]], the lowest-energy non-radical state of dioxygen, is less stable than the diradical due to [[Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity]]. The relative stability of the oxygen diradical is primarily due to the [[Quantum chemistry|spin-forbidden]] nature of the triplet-singlet transition required for it to grab electrons, i.e., "'''oxidize'''". The diradical state of oxygen also results in its paramagnetic character, which is demonstrated by its attraction to an external magnet.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[paramagnetism]] does not necessarily imply radical character.&lt;/ref&gt; Diradicals can also occur in [[Transition metal oxo complex|metal-oxo complexes]], lending themselves for studies of [[spin forbidden reactions]] in [[transition metal]] chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Linde|first1=C.|last2=Åkermark|first2=B.|last3=Norrby|first3=P.-O.|last4=Svensson|first4=M.|date=1999|title=Timing is Critical: Effect of Spin Changes on the Diastereoselectivity in Mn(Salen)-Catalyzed Epoxidation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=21|pages=5083–84|doi=10.1021/ja9809915}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbene]]s in their triplet state can be viewed as diradicals centred on the same atom, while these are usually highly reactive [[persistent carbene]]s are known, with N-heterocyclic carbenes being the most common example.

Triplet [[carbene]]s and [[nitrene]]s are diradicals.  Their chemical properties are distinct from the properties of their singlet analogues.

==Occurrence of radicals==
===Combustion===
[[File:Spectrum of blue flame.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Spectrum of the blue flame from a [[butane]] torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and [[Swan bands]]]]
{{main|Combustion#Reaction mechanism}}
A familiar radical reaction is [[combustion]]. The [[oxygen]] molecule is a stable [[diradical]], best represented by &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;O–O&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;. Because [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the electrons are parallel, this molecule is stable.  While the [[ground state]] of oxygen is this unreactive spin-unpaired ([[Triplet oxygen|triplet]]) diradical, an extremely reactive spin-paired ([[Singlet oxygen|singlet]]) state is available. For combustion to occur, the [[energy barrier]] between these must be overcome. This barrier can be overcome by heat, requiring high temperatures.  The triplet-singlet transition is also "[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]".  This presents an additional barrier to the reaction.  It also means molecular oxygen is relatively unreactive at room temperature except in the presence of a catalytic heavy atom such as iron or copper.

Combustion consists of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The [[flammability]] of a given material strongly depends on the concentration of radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to [[combustion]] of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out.  As indicated,  promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability.  For example, because lead itself deactivates radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, [[tetraethyl lead]] was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues ([[engine knocking]]) or premature ignition ([[preignition]]).

When a hydrocarbon is burned, a large number of different oxygen radicals are involved. Initially, [[hydroperoxyl|hydroperoxyl radical]] (HOO&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) are formed. These then react further to give [[organic hydroperoxide]]s that break up into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;).

===Polymerization===
Many [[polymerization]] reactions are initiated by radicals. Polymerization involves an initial radical adding to non-radical (usually an alkene) to give new radicals.  This process is the basis of the [[radical chain reaction]]. The art of polymerization entails the method by which the initiating radical is introduced.  For example, [[methyl methacrylate]] (MMA) can be polymerized to produce [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (PMMA - Plexiglas or Perspex) via a repeating series of [[Free-radical addition|radical addition]] steps:  
[[image:PMMA-Wachstum.svg|upright=3.35|center|thumb|Radical intermediates in the formation of polymethacrylate (plexiglas or perspex)]]

Newer radical polymerization methods are known as [[living polymerization|living radical polymerization]].  Variants include reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]]) and atom transfer radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]]).

Being a prevalent radical, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with many organic compounds to generate radicals together with the [[hydroperoxide]] radical. [[Drying oil]]s and alkyd paints harden due to radical crosslinking initiated by oxygen from the atmosphere.

===Atmospheric radicals===
{{See also|Oxygen cycle|Ozone-oxygen cycle}}
The most common radical in the lower atmosphere is molecular dioxygen. [[Photodissociation]] of source molecules produces other radicals. In the lower atmosphere, important radical are produced by the photodissociation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] to an oxygen atom and [[nitric oxide]] (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1.1}} below), which plays a key role in [[Photochemical smog|smog]] formation—and the photodissociation of ozone to give the excited oxygen atom O(1D) (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1.2}} below). The net and return reactions are also shown ({{EquationNote|eq. 1.3}} and {{EquationNote|eq. 1.4}}, respectively).
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;NO2 -&gt;[h \nu] NO + O&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1.1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;O + O2 -&gt; O3&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1.2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;NO2 + O2 -&gt;[h \nu] NO + O3&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1.3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;NO + O3 -&gt; NO2 + O2&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1.4}}}}
In the upper atmosphere, the photodissociation of normally unreactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) by solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] is an important source of radicals (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give the [[chlorine]] radical, Cl&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;, which catalyzes the conversion of [[ozone]] to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus facilitating [[ozone depletion]] ({{EquationNote|eq. 2.2}}–{{EquationNote|eq. 2.4}} below).
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;CFCS -&gt;[h \nu] Cl^\bullet&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2.1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;Cl^\bullet {}+ O3 -&gt; ClO^\bullet {}+ O2&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2.2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;O3 -&gt;[h \nu] O + O2&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2.3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;O {}+ ClO^\bullet -&gt; Cl^\bullet {}+ O2&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2.4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;2O3 -&gt;[h \nu] 3O2&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2.5}}}}
Such reactions cause the depletion of the [[ozone layer]], especially since the chlorine radical is free to engage in another reaction chain; consequently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons as [[refrigerant]]s has been restricted.

[[Image:Lignin structure.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|An approximate structure of lignin, which constitutes about 30% of plant matter. It is formed by radical reactions.]]
Radicals play important roles in biology.  Many of these are necessary for life, such as the intracellular killing of bacteria by phagocytic cells such as [[granulocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s. Radicals are involved in [[signal transduction|cell signalling]] processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pacher P, Beckman JS, Liaudet L |title=Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in health and disease |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=315–424 |year=2007 |pmid=17237348 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00029.2006 |pmc=2248324}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[redox signaling]].  For example, radical attack of linoleic acid produces a series of [[13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]s and [[9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]s, which may act to regulate localized tissue inflammatory and/or healing responses, pain perception, and the proliferation of malignant cells. Radical attacks on arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid produce a similar but broader array of signaling products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3389/fphys.2013.00366 | pmid=24379787 | pmc=3863722 | volume=4 | pages=366 | title=Lipid peroxidation: pathophysiological and pharmacological implications in the eye | journal=Frontiers in Physiology| year=2013 | last1=Njie-Mbye | first1=Ya Fatou | last2=Kulkarni-Chitnis | first2=Madhura | last3=Opere | first3=Catherine A. | last4=Barrett | first4=Aaron | last5=Ohia | first5=Sunny E. | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radicals may also be involved in [[Parkinson's disease]], senile and drug-induced [[deafness]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[Alzheimer's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Floyd | first1 = R.A. | year = 1999 | title = Neuroinflammatory processes are important in neurodegenerative diseases: An hypothesis to explain the increased formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as major factors involved in neurodegenerative disease development | journal = Free Radical Biology and Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 9–10| pages = 1346–55 | doi =  10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00293-7| pmid = 10381209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic free-radical syndrome, the iron-storage disease [[hemochromatosis]], is typically associated with a constellation of free-radical-related symptoms including movement disorder, psychosis, skin pigmentary [[melanin]] abnormalities, deafness, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The [[free-radical theory]] of aging proposes that radicals underlie the [[Senescence|aging process]] itself. Similarly, the process of mito[[hormesis]] suggests that repeated exposure to radicals may extend life span.

Because radicals are necessary for life, the body has a number of mechanisms to minimize radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the [[enzyme]]s [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione reductase]]. In addition, [[antioxidant]]s play a key role in these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] and [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that [[bilirubin]] and [[uric acid]] can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain radicals. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of [[purine]]s. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to [[jaundice]], which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the role of radicals in biology and of the use of electron spin resonance in their detection may be found in {{cite book|author=Rhodes C.J.|title=Toxicology of the Human Environment – the critical role of free radicals|publisher=Taylor and Francis|place= London|year= 2000|isbn= 978-0-7484-0916-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactive oxygen species===
[[Reactive oxygen species]] or ROS are species such as [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hydroxyl radical]], commonly associated with cell damage. ROS form as a natural by-product of the normal metabolism of [[oxygen]] and have important roles in cell signaling.
Two important oxygen-centered radicals are [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radical]]. They derive from molecular oxygen under reducing conditions. However, because of their reactivity, these same radicals can participate in unwanted side reactions resulting in cell damage. Excessive amounts of these radicals can lead to cell injury and [[death]], which may contribute to many diseases such as [[cancer]], [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[diabetes]] and major disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rajamani Karthikeyan |author2=Manivasagam T |author3=Anantharaman P |author4=Balasubramanian T |author5=Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of [[cancer]] are thought to be the result of reactions between radicals and [[DNA]], potentially resulting in [[mutation]]s that can adversely affect the [[cell cycle]] and potentially lead to malignancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mukherjee | first1 = P.K. | last2 = Marcheselli | first2 = V.L. | last3 = Serhan | first3 = C.N. | last4 = Bazan | first4 = N.G. | year = 2004 | title = Neuroprotecin D1: A docosahexanoic acid-derived docosatriene protects human retinal pigment epithelial cells from oxidative stress | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA | volume = 101 | issue = 22| pages = 8491–96 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0402531101 | pmid=15152078 | pmc=420421| bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.8491M | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the symptoms of [[Senescence|aging]] such as [[atherosclerosis]] are also attributed to radical induced oxidation of cholesterol to 7-ketocholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10224662 | volume=31 | issue=3–4 | title=7-Ketocholesterol | year=1999 | journal=Int.

Radicals produced by [[cigarette]] [[smoke]] are implicated in inactivation of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] in the [[lung]]. This process promotes the development of [[emphysema]].

[[Oxybenzone]] has been found to form radicals in sunlight, and therefore may be associated with cell damage as well. This only occurred when it was combined with other ingredients commonly found in sunscreens, like [[titanium oxide]] and [[octyl methoxycinnamate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serpone | first1 = N | last2 = Salinaro | first2 = A | last3 = Emeline | first3 = AV | last4 = Horikoshi | first4 = S | last5 = Hidaka | first5 = H | last6 = Zhao | first6 = JC | year = 2002 | title = An in vitro systematic spectroscopic examination of the photostabilities of a random set of commercial sunscreen lotions and their chemical UVB/UVA active agents | journal = Photochemical &amp; Photobiological Sciences | volume = 1 | issue = 12| pages = 970–81 | doi=10.1039/b206338g | pmid = 12661594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROS attack the [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], [[linoleic acid]], to form a series of [[13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]] and [[9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]] products that serve as signaling molecules that may trigger responses that counter the tissue injury which caused their formation.  ROS attacks other polyunsaturated fatty acids, e.g. [[arachidonic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]], to produce a similar series of signaling products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2013.00366 | volume=4 | title=Lipid peroxidation: pathophysiological and pharmacological implications in the eye | journal=Frontiers in Physiology| year=2013 | last1=Njie-Mbye | first1=Ya Fatou | last2=Kulkarni-Chitnis | first2=Madhura | last3=Opere | first3=Catherine A. | last4=Barrett | first4=Aaron | last5=Ohia | first5=Sunny E. | page=366 | pmc=3863722 | pmid=24379787| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and nomenclature==
[[File:Gombergm01.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Moses Gomberg]] (1866–1947), the founder of radical chemistry]]
Until late in the 20th century the word "radical" was used in chemistry to indicate any connected group of atoms, such as a [[methyl|methyl group]] or a [[carboxyl]], whether it was part of a larger molecule or a molecule on its own. The qualifier "free" was then needed to specify the unbound case.  Following recent nomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a [[functional group]] or [[substituent]], and "radical" now implies "free".  However, the old nomenclature may still appear in some books.

The term radical was already in use when the now obsolete [[radical theory]] was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase "radical" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word "radix" meaning "root"). Historically, the term ''radical'' in [[radical theory]] was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called [[functional group]]s. For example, [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] was described as consisting of a methyl "radical" and a hydroxyl "radical". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in [[mass spectrometry]] when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.

In a modern context the first [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon–containing) radical identified was the [[triphenylmethyl radical]], (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;.  This species was discovered by [[Moses Gomberg]] in 1900. In 1933 [[Morris S. Kharasch]] and [[Frank R. Mayo|Frank Mayo]] proposed that free radicals were responsible for [[anti-Markovnikov addition]] of [[hydrogen bromide]] to [[allyl bromide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01333a041 | volume=55 | title=The Peroxide Effect in the Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds.

In most fields of chemistry, the historical definition of radicals contends that the molecules have nonzero electron spin. However, in fields including [[spectroscopy]] and [[astrochemistry]], the definition is slightly different. [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who won the Nobel prize for his research into the electron structure and geometry of radicals, suggested a looser definition of free radicals: "any transient (chemically unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion)".&lt;ref&gt;G. Herzberg (1971), "The spectra and structures of simple free radicals", {{ISBN|0-486-65821-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of his suggestion is that there are many chemically unstable molecules that have zero spin, such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and so on. This definition is more convenient for discussions of transient chemical processes and astrochemistry; therefore researchers in these fields prefer to use this loose definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html 28th International Symposium on Free Radicals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014949/http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html |date=2007-07-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction in chemical reactions==
&lt;!-- "Mass spectrum analysis" links here --&gt; 
In chemical equations, radicals are frequently denoted by a dot placed immediately to the right of the atomic symbol or molecular formula as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}_2 \; \xrightarrow{UV} \; 2 {\mathrm{Cl} ^\bullet} &lt;/math&gt;

Radical [[reaction mechanism]]s use single-headed arrows to depict the movement of single electrons:

[[File:Radical.svg|centre|thumb|upright=1.8]]

The [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the breaking bond is drawn with a 'fish-hook' arrow to distinguish from the usual movement of two electrons depicted by a standard curly arrow. The second electron of the breaking bond also moves to pair up with the attacking radical electron; this is not explicitly indicated in this case.

Radicals also take part in [[radical addition]] and [[radical substitution]] as [[reactive intermediate]]s. [[Chain reaction#Chemical chain reactions|Chain reactions]] involving radicals can usually be divided into three distinct processes.  These are ''initiation'', ''propagation'', and ''termination''.
*''Initiation'' reactions are those that result in a net increase in the number of radicals. They may involve the formation of radicals from stable species as in Reaction 1 above or they may involve reactions of radicals with stable species to form more radicals.
*''Propagation'' reactions are those reactions involving radicals in which the total number of radicals remains the same.
*''Termination'' reactions are those reactions resulting in a net decrease in the number of radicals. Typically two radicals combine to form a more stable species, for example:
*:2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; → Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

'''Radioactivity''' is generally used in life sciences for highly sensitive and direct measurements of biological phenomena, and for visualizing the location of [[biomolecule]]s [[radiolabelled]] with a [[radioisotope]].

All atoms exist as stable or unstable [[isotope]]s and the latter decay at a given [[half-life]] ranging from attoseconds to billions of years; radioisotopes useful to biological and experimental systems have half-lives ranging from minutes to months.  In the case of the hydrogen isotope [[tritium]] (half-life = 12.3 years) and [[carbon-14]] (half-life = 5,730 years), these isotopes derive their importance from all organic life containing hydrogen and carbon and therefore can be used to study countless living processes, reactions, and phenomena.  Most short lived isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, linear [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[nuclear reactor]]s and their relatively short half-lives give them high maximum theoretical specific activities which is useful for detection in biological systems.

[[File:Y-90 tacatuzumab tetraxetan structure.svg|thumb|DOTA linked to the monoclonal antibody [[tacatuzumab]] and chelating [[yttrium-90]] ]]
[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|Whole-body PET scan using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG showing intestinal tumors and non-specific accumulation in bladder]]  
[[Isotopic labeling|Radiolabeling]] is a technique used to track the passage of a molecule that incorporates a radioisotope through a reaction, metabolic pathway, cell, tissue, organism, or biological system. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing specific atoms by their isotope.  Replacing an atom with its own radioisotope is an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] label that does not alter the structure of the molecule.  Alternatively, molecules can be radiolabeled by chemical reactions that introduce an atom, [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], or [[functional group]] that contains a [[radionuclide]].  For example, radio-iodination of peptides and proteins with [[Isotopes of iodine#Radioiodines I-123.2C I-124.2C I-125.2C and I-131 in medicine and biology|biologically useful iodine isotopes]] is easily done by an oxidation reaction that replaces the hydroxyl group with iodine on [[tyrosine]] and [[histadine]] residues.  Another example is to use chelators such [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] that can be chemically coupled to a protein; the chelator in turn traps radiometals thus radiolabeling the protein.  This has been used for introducing Yttrium-90 onto a monoclonal antibody for therapeutic purposes and for introducing Gallium-68 onto the peptide [[Octreotide]] for diagnostic imaging by [[Positron emission tomography|PET imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Breeman | first1 = W. A. P. | last2 = De Blois | first2 = E. | last3 = Sze Chan | first3 = H. | last4 = Konijnenberg | first4 = M. | last5 = Kwekkeboom | first5 = D. J. | last6 = Krenning | first6 = E.

Radiolabeling is not necessary for some applications.  For some purposes,  soluble ionic salts can be used directly without further modification (e.g., [[gallium-67]], [[gallium-68]], and [[radioiodine]] isotopes).  These uses rely on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the organism or biological system.

[[Molecular imaging]] is the biomedical field that employs radiotracers to visualize and quantify biological processes using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) imaging.  Again, a key feature of using radioactivity in life science applications is that it is a quantitative technique, so PET/SPECT not only reveals where a radiolabelled molecule is but how much is there.

[[Radiobiology]] (also known as radiation biology) is a field of clinical and basic medical sciences that involves the study of the action of radioactivity on biological systems.  The controlled action of deleterious radioactivity on living systems is the basis of [[radiation therapy]].

==Examples of biologically useful radionuclides==
===Hydrogen===
[[Tritium]] (hydrogen-3) is a very low [[Beta decay|beta]] energy emitter that can be used to label [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, drugs and almost any organic biomolecule. The maximum theoretical specific activity of tritium is {{convert|28.8|kCi/mol|TBq/mol|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voges|first1=Rolf|last2=Heys|first2=J. Richard|last3=Moenius|first3=Thomas|title=Preparation of compounds labeled with tritium and carbon-14|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-470-51607-2|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VgcIEhrwCIC&amp;pg=PA146|access-date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is often more than one tritium atom per molecule: for example, tritiated [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]] is sold by most suppliers with carbons 5 and 6 each bonded to a tritium atom.

For tritium detection, liquid [[scintillation counter]]s have been classically employed, in which the energy of a tritium decay is transferred to a [[Scintillator|scintillant]] molecule in solution which in turn gives off photons whose intensity and spectrum can be measured by a [[photomultiplier]] array.  The efficiency of this process is 4–50%, depending on the scintillation cocktail used. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakonić|first1=I|last2=Nikolov|first2=J|display-authors=etal|title=Study on quench effects in liquid scintillation counting during tritium measurements|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|date=2014|volume=302|issue=1|pages=253–259|doi=10.1007/s10967-014-3191-1|s2cid=95524987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scintillation Cocktails &amp; Consumables - For every liquid scintillation counting application|url=https://www.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/BRO_ScintillationCocktailsAndConsumables.pdf|website=PerkinElmer|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327093930/https://www.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/BRO_ScintillationCocktailsAndConsumables.pdf|archive-date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measurements are typically expressed in [[counts per minute]] (CPM) or disintegrations per minute (DPM).  Alternatively, a solid-state, tritium-specific [[Photostimulated luminescence|phosphor screen]] can be used together with a phosphorimager to measure and simultaneously image the radiotracer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storage Phosphor Screen BAS-IP|url=https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|website=GE Life Sciences|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911190807/https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|archive-date=11 September 2017|date=2012|quote=Data file 29-0262-96 AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements/images are digital in nature and can be expressed in intensity or densitometry units within a [[region of interest]] (ROI).

===Carbon===
[[Carbon-14]] has a long half-life of {{val|5730|40|u=years}}. Its maximum specific activity is {{convert|0.0624|kCi/mol|TBq/mol|abbr=on}}. It is used in applications such as [[radiometric dating]] or drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.aptochem.com/t-radiolabeled-test-articles.aspx | title=Radiolabeled Test Articles | publisher=AptoChem }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon-14 labeling is common in drug development to do [[ADME]] (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) studies in animal models and in human toxicology and clinical trials.  Since tritium exchange may occur in some radiolabeled compounds, this does not happen with carbon-14 and may thus be preferred.

===Sodium===
[[Sodium-22]] and [[chlorine-36]] are commonly used to study [[ion transporter]]s. However, sodium-22 is hard to screen off and chlorine-36, with a half-life of 300,000 years, has low activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biochemic methods. Sample for medicine Students''. 2nd ed 2008, by Birgitte Lüttge. Aarhus University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sulfur===
[[Sulfur-35]] is used to label proteins and nucleic acids. [[Cysteine]] is an [[amino acid]] containing a [[thiol group]] which can be labeled by sulfur-35. For [[nucleotide]]s that do not contain a sulfur group, the oxygen on one of the phosphate groups can be substituted with a sulfur. This [[thiophosphate]] acts the same as a normal phosphate group, although there is a slight bias against it by most [[polymerase]]s. The maximum theoretical specific activity is {{convert|1494|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus-32]] is widely used for labeling nucleic acids and phosphoproteins. It has the highest emission energy (1.7&amp;nbsp;MeV) of all common research radioisotopes. This is a major advantage in experiments for which sensitivity is a primary consideration, such as titrations of very strong interactions (''i.e.'', very low [[dissociation constant]]), footprinting experiments, and detection of low-abundance phosphorylated species. Phosphorus-32 is also relatively inexpensive. Because of its high energy, however, its safe use requires a number of [[engineering controls]] (''e.g.'', [[acrylic glass]]) and [[administrative controls]].  The half-life of phosphorus-32 is 14.2 days, and its maximum specific activity is {{convert|9131|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

[[Phosphorus-33]] is used to label nucleotides. It is less energetic than phosphorus-32 and does not require protection with [[plexiglass]]. A disadvantage is its higher cost compared to phosphorus-32, as most of the bombarded phosphorus-31 will have acquired only one [[neutron]], while only some will have acquired two or more. Its maximum specific activity is {{convert|5118|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

===Iodine===
[[Iodine-125]] is commonly used for labeling proteins, usually at tyrosine residues. Unbound iodine is volatile and must be handled in a fume hood.  Its maximum specific activity is {{convert|2176|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

A good example of the difference in energy of the various radionuclei is the detection window ranges used to detect them, which are generally proportional to the energy of the emission, but vary from machine to machine: in a Perkin elmer TriLux Beta scintillation counter &lt;!-- Googled to see where the hell did the values come from)--&gt;, the hydrogen-3 energy range window is between channel 5–360; carbon-14, sulfur-35 and phosphorus-33 are in the window of 361–660; and phosphorus-32 is in the window of 661–1024.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Detection==
[[File:Autoradiography_of_a_brain_slice_from_an_embryonal_rat_-_PMID19190758_PLoS_0004371.png|thumb|Autoradiograph of a coronal brain tissue slice, with a radiolabeled GAD67 probe.  Most intense signal is seen in subventricular zone.]]
[[File:Southern-Blot-Autoradiogramm.jpg|thumb|Autoradiograph of Southern blot membrane]]

===Quantitative===
In [[liquid scintillation counting]], a small aliquot, filter or swab is added to scintillation fluid and the plate or vial is placed in a [[scintillation counter]] to measure the radioactive emissions.  Manufacturers have incorporated solid scintillants into multi-well plates to eliminate the need for scintillation fluid and make this into a high-throughput technique.

A [[gamma counter]] is similar in format to scintillation counting but it detects gamma emissions directly and does not require a scintillant.

A [[Geiger counter]] is a quick and rough approximation of activity. Lower energy emitters such as tritium can not be detected.

===Qualitative AND Quantitative===
[[Autoradiography]]: A tissue section affixed to a microscope slide or a membrane such as a [[Northern blot]] or a hybridized [[slot blot]] can be placed against x-ray film or phosphor screens to acquire a photographic or digital image.  The density of exposure, if calibrated, can supply exacting quantitative information.

[[Phosphor storage screen]]: The slide or membrane is placed against a phosphor screen which is then scanned in a [[phosphorimager]]. This is many times faster than film/emulsion techniques and outputs data in a digital form, thus it has largely replaced film/emulsion techniques.

===Microscopy===
[[Electron microscopy]]: The sample is not exposed to a beam of electrons but detectors picks up the expelled electrons from the radionuclei.

Micro-autoradiography: A tissue section, typically cryosectioned, is placed against a phosphor screen as above.

Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography (QWBA):  Larger than micro-autoradiography, whole animals, typically rodents, can be analyzed for biodistribution studies.

==Scientific methods==

[[Schild regression]] is a radioligand binding assay. It is used for DNA labelling (5' and 3'), leaving the nucleic acids intact.

==Radioactivity concentration==
A vial of radiolabel has a "total activity". Taking as an example γ32P [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], from the catalogues of the two major suppliers, Perkin Elmer NEG502H500UC or GE AA0068-500UCI, in this case, the total activity is 500 μCi (other typical numbers are 250 μCi or 1 mCi). This is contained in a certain volume, depending on the radioactive concentration, such as 5 to 10 mCi/mL (185 to 370 TBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); typical volumes include 50 or 25 μL.

Not all molecules in the solution have a P-32 on the last (i.e., gamma) phosphate: the "specific activity" gives the radioactivity concentration and depends on the radionuclei's half-life. If every molecule were labelled, the maximum theoretical specific activity is obtained that for P-32 is 9131 Ci/mmol. Due to pre-calibration and efficiency issues this number is never seen on a label; the values often found are 800, 3000 and 6000 Ci/mmol. With this number it is possible to calculate the total chemical concentration and the hot-to-cold ratio.

"Calibration date" is the date in which the vial’s activity is the same as on the label. "Pre-calibration" is when the activity is calibrated in a future date to compensate for the decay occurred during shipping.

==Comparison with fluorescence==
{{See also|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
Prior to the widespread use of [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]] in the past three decades radioactivity was the most common label.

The primary advantage of fluorescence over radiotracers is that it does not require radiological controls and their associated expenses and safety measures.  The decay of radioisotopes may limit the [[shelf life]] of a reagent, requiring its replacement and thus increasing expenses.  Several fluorescent molecules can be used simultaneously (given that they do not overlap, cf. FRET), whereas with radioactivity two [[isotopes]] can be used ([[tritium]] and a low energy isotope, e.g. [[Phosphorus-33|&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]] due to different intensities) but require special equipment (a tritium screen and a regular phosphor-imaging screen, a specific dual channel detector, e.g.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194225/http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html]).

Fluorescence is not necessary easier or more convenient to use because fluorescence requires specialized equipment of its own and because [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] makes absolute and/or reproducible quantification difficult.

The primary disadvantage of fluorescence versus radiotracers is a significant biological problem:  chemically tagging a molecule with a fluorescent dye radically changes the structure of the molecule, which in turn can radically change the way that molecule interacts with other molecules.  In contrast, intrinsic radiolabeling of a molecule can be done without altering its structure in any way.  For example, substituting a H-3 for a hydrogen atom or C-14 for a carbon atom does not change the conformation, structure, or any other property of the molecule, it's just switching forms of the same atom.  Thus an intrinsically radiolabeled molecule is identical to its unlabeled counterpart.

Measurement of biological phenomena by radiotracers is always direct.  In contrast, many life science fluorescence applications are indirect, consisting of a fluorescent dye increasing, decreasing, or shifting in wavelength emission upon binding to the molecule of interest.

==Safety==
If good [[health physics]] controls are maintained in a laboratory where radionuclides are used, it is unlikely that the overall radiation dose received by workers will be of much significance. Nevertheless, the effects of low doses are mostly unknown so many regulations exist to avoid unnecessary risks, such as skin or internal exposure. Due to the low penetration power and many variables involved it is hard to convert a radioactive concentration to a dose.
1 μCi of P-32 on a square centimetre of skin (through a dead layer of a thickness of 70 μm) gives 7961 [[Rad (unit)|rads]] (79.61 [[gray (unit)|grays]]) per hour . Similarly a [[mammogram]] gives an exposure of 300 [[Röntgen equivalent man|mrem]] (3 [[millisievert|mSv]]) on a larger volume (in the US, the average annual dose is 620 mrem or 6.2 mSv&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=NCRP|volume=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

The stronger detergents in RIPA buffer (such as SDS) cause greater protein denaturation and decrease protein-protein interactions.

==Recipe==

RIPA buffer recipes vary slightly between authors and may include:

* 10-50 mM [[Tris]]-HCl (10 mM [[sodium phosphate]] may be used instead), pH 7–8 
* 150 mM NaCl to keep the osmotic pressure near physiological 
* nonionic detergents (1% Triton X-100 or [[NP-40]]) to prevent non-specific interactions between proteins or with the tube  
* anionic detergents (0.1-0.5% [[deoxycholate]], 0.1-0.5% [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]]).

The following ingredients are optional and included as needed:
 
* [[Protease]] inhibitors (1 mM [[PMSF]] (fresh from 1 M stock in i-propanol), 1 µg/ml each [[leupeptin]], [[aprotinin]], [[pepstatin]], 1-5 mM [[EDTA]], 0.5-1 mM [[EGTA (chemical)|EGTA]], 5 mM [[aminocaproic acid]]) or commercial protease inhibitor cocktail (use according to the manufacturer's instruction)
* 1 mM each Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; as phosphatase inhibitor (if phosphorylation status is important)
* 1 mM NaF as preservative
* 5-10 mM [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT) or [[β-mercaptoethanol]] as a reducing agent.

If the [[sensory receptors|receptors]] are endowed with distinct [[transfer function]]s in such a way that the points of highest sensitivity are scattered along the axis of the quality being measured, the precision of the sense organ as a whole can be increased. This was shown for the [[chordotonal organ]] in the [[locust]] leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.|last1=Campbell|display-authors=etal|title="Structure and physiology of a chordotonal organ in the locust leg"|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=48|pages=305-323|date=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=T.|last1=Matheson|title="Range fractionation in the locust metathoracic femoral chordotonal organ"|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=170|pages=509-520|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3070" xml:space="preserve">'''Range state''' is a term generally used in [[zoogeography]] and [[conservation biology]] to refer to any [[nation]] that exercises jurisdiction over any part of a [[range (biology)|range]] which a particular [[species]], [[taxon]] or [[biotope]] inhabits, or crosses or overflies at any time on its normal [[Animal migration|migration]] route.  The term is often expanded to ''also'' include, particularly in [[international waters]], any nation with vessels flying their flag that engage in exploitation (e.g. hunting, fishing, capturing) of that species.&lt;ref name="CMG-text"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.cms.int/documents/convtxt/cms_convtxt_english.pdf | title=Convention Text | book-title=Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals | access-date=17 February 2012 | location=Bonn, Germany | date=23 June 1979 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406235608/http://www.cms.int/documents/convtxt/cms_convtxt_english.pdf | archive-date=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deKlemm"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.fni.no/ybiced/94_05_klemm.pdf | title=The Problem of Migratory Species in International Law | author=de Klemm, Cyrille | journal=Green Globe Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development 1994 | year=1994 | pages=66–77 |editor1=Helge Ole Bergesen |editor2=Georg Parmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries in which a species occurs only as a [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] or ‘accidental’ visitor outside of its normal range or migration route are not usually considered range states.

Because governmental conservation policy is often formulated on a national scale, and because in most countries, both governmental and private conservation organisations are also organised at the national level, the range state concept is often used by international conservation organizations in formulating their conservation and campaigning policy.

An example of one such organization is the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ([[Bonn Convention|CMS]], or the  “[[Bonn Convention]]”).  It is a [[multilateral treaty]] focusing on the conservation of critically endangered and threatened migratory species, their habitats and their migration routes.  Because such habitats and/or migration routes may span national boundaries, conservation efforts are less likely to succeed without the cooperation, participation, and coordination of each of the range states.&lt;ref name="deKlemm" /&gt;

A '''rapid antigen test''' ('''RAT'''), sometimes called a '''rapid antigen detection test''' ('''RADT'''), '''antigen rapid test''' ('''ART'''), or [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary#loosely|loosely]] just a '''rapid test''', is a [[rapid diagnostic test]] suitable for [[point-of-care testing]] that directly detects the presence or absence of an [[antigen]]. Such tests are a type of [[lateral flow test]] that detect antigens, distinguishing them from other [[medical test]]s that detect [[antibody|antibodies]] ([[Antibody titer|antibody test]]s) or [[nucleic acid]] ([[nucleic acid test]]s), of either [[medical laboratory|laboratory]] or [[point-of-care]] types. Rapid tests generally give a result in 5 to 30 minutes, require minimal training or infrastructure, and have significant cost advantages.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} Rapid antigen tests for the detection of [[SARS-CoV-2]], the virus that causes [[COVID-19]], have been commonly used during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. 

For many years, an early and major class of RATs—the [[rapid strep test]]s for streptococci—were so often the referent when RATs or RADTs were mentioned that the two latter terms were often loosely treated as synonymous with those. Since the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], awareness of RATs is no longer limited to health professionals and COVID-19 has become the expected referent, so more precise usage is required in other circumstances. 

RATs are based on the principle of [[antigen-antibody interaction]]. Antibodies directed against the target antigen (generally a protein on the surface of a virus) are fixed to the indicator line of the chromatography substrate and the visualisation marker (generally a dye marker, though sometimes these antibodies are modified to fluoresce). When the dissolved sample is added it mobilises the visualisation marker, which then travels through the chromatography substrate with the sample. Virus particles (which the antibodies linked to the visualisation marker have already bound to) are immobilised by the antibodies fixed to the indicator line as they travel through the substrate. This also immobilises the bound visualisation marker, allowing visual detection of significant levels of virus in a sample.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A positive result with an antigen test should generally be confirmed by RT-qPCR or some other test with higher sensitivity and specificity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title=SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19): Rapid Antigen Test for Diagnosis Biotrend |url=https://www.biotrend.com/lesen/newsletter-26/sars-cov-2-covid-19-rapid-antigen-2406.html |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=www.biotrend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Common examples of RATs or RADTs include: 
* [[COVID-19 testing]]-related rapid tests
* [[Rapid strep test]]s (for [[Streptococcus|streptococcal]] antigens)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stewart EH, Davis B, Clemans-Taylor BL, Littenberg B, Estrada CA, Centor RM | title = Rapid antigen group A streptococcus test to diagnose pharyngitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = e111727 | date = 2014-11-04 | pmid = 25369170 | pmc = 4219770 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0111727 | bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9k1727S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 are one of the most useful applications of these tests. Often called [[lateral flow test]]s, they have provided global governments with several benefits. They are quick to implement with minimal training, offered significant cost advantages, costing a fraction of existing forms of PCR testing and give users a result within 5–30 minutes. Rapid antigen tests have found their best use as part of mass testing or population-wide screening approaches.&lt;ref name="Press corner"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Press corner|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/home/en|access-date=2021-03-20|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are successful in these approaches because in addition to the aforementioned benefits, they identify individuals who are the most infectious and could potentially spread the virus to a large number of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Guglielmi G|date=September 2020|title=Fast coronavirus tests: what they can and can't do|journal=Nature|volume=585|issue=7826|pages=496–498|bibcode=2020Natur.585..496G|doi=10.1038/d41586-020-02661-2|pmid=32939084|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs slightly from other forms of COVID-19 tests such as PCR that are generally seen to be a useful test for individuals.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

== Scientific basis and underlying biology ==
RATs are [[immunochromatographic]] assays which give results that can be seen with the naked eye (with or without special illumination, such as a UV lamp). They are qualitative in nature, although within a certain range it is possible to make rough order of magnitude estimates of viral load from the results. RATs are generally screening tests, with relatively low [[sensitivity and specificity]], thus results should be evaluated on the basis of confirmatory tests like [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] testing or western blot.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

One inherent advantage of an antigen test over an antibody test (such as antibody-detecting [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS#Rapid or point-of-care tests|rapid HIV test]]s) is that it can take time for the [[immune system]] to develop antibodies after [[infection]] begins, but the foreign antigen is present right away. Although any diagnostic test may have [[false negative]]s, this latency period can open an especially wide avenue for false negatives in antibody tests, although the particulars depend on which disease and which test are involved. A rapid antigen test typically costs around US$5 to manufacture.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

      <text bytes="1408" xml:space="preserve">A '''rare-cutter enzyme''' is a [[restriction enzyme]] with a [[recognition sequence]] which occurs only rarely in a genome.  An example is NotI, which cuts after the first GC of a 5'-GCGGCCGC-3' sequence; restriction enzymes with seven and eight base pair recognition sequences are often also called rare-cutter enzymes (six bp recognition sequences are much more common).

For example, rare-cutter enzymes with 7-nucleotide recognition sites cut once every 4&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; bp (16,384 bp), and those with 8-nucleotide recognition sites cut every 4&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; bp (65,536 bp) respectively. They are used in [[DNA sequencing|top-down mapping]] to cut a chromosome into chunks of these sizes on average.

{{refimprove|date=January 2019}}
In [[chemical biology]] and [[biomolecular engineering]], '''rational design''' ('''RD''') is an [[umbrella term]] which invites the strategy of creating new molecules with a certain functionality, based upon the ability to predict how the molecule's structure (specifically derived from [[structural motif|motif]]s) will affect its behavior through physical models.  This can be done either from scratch or by making [[mathematical model|calculated variations]] on a known structure, and usually complements [[directed evolution]].

== Applications ==
As an example, rational design is used to decipher [[collagen]] stability, mapping ligand-receptor interactions, unveiling protein folding and dynamics, and creating extra-biological structures by using fluorinated [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fluorine in Medicinal Chemistry and Chemical Biology|last=Ojima|first=Iwao|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., Publications|year=2009|isbn=9781405167208|location=West Sussex|pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; To treat [[cancer]], rational design is used for targeted therapies where proteins are engineered to modify the communication of cells with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biomedical Engineering for Global Health|last=Richards-Kortum|first=Rebecca|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521877978|location=Cambridge|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the rational design of alfa-alkyl [[auxin]] molecules, which are auxin analogs capable of binding and blocking the formation of the [[hormone receptor]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Chemistry Meets Biology – Generating Innovative Concepts, Methods and Tools for Scientific Discovery in the Plant Sciences|last=Kombrink|first=Erich|last2=Kaiser|first2=Markus|publisher=Frontiers Media SA|year=2016|isbn=9782889199280|location=Lausanne|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SulfurReagent.jpg|372x372px|thumb|Reagents, such as [[sulfur]] (''pictured''), are the starting materials that are used in chemical reactions.]]

In [[chemistry]], a '''reagent''' ({{IPAc-en|r|i|ˈ|eɪ|dʒ|ən|t|}} {{Respell|ree|AY|jənt}}) or '''analytical reagent''' is a substance or compound added to a system to cause a [[chemical reaction]], or test if one occurs.&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Reactant |file=R05163 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''reactant'' and ''reagent'' are often used interchangeably, but '''reactant''' specifies a substance ''consumed'' in the course of a chemical reaction.&lt;ref name=gold/&gt; ''[[Solvent]]s'', though involved in the [[reaction mechanism]], are usually not called reactants. Similarly, ''[[catalysis|catalysts]]'' are not consumed by the reaction, so they are not reactants. In [[biochemistry]], especially in connection with [[enzyme]]-catalyzed reactions, the reactants are commonly called [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]].

==Definitions==

=== Organic chemistry ===
In [[organic chemistry]], the term "reagent" denotes a chemical ingredient (a compound or mixture, typically of inorganic or small organic molecules) introduced to cause the desired transformation of an organic substance. Examples include the [[Collins reagent]], [[Fenton's reagent]], and [[Grignard reagent]]s.

=== Analytical chemistry ===
In [[analytical chemistry]], a reagent is a compound or mixture used to detect the presence or absence of another substance, e.g. by a color change, or to measure the concentration of a substance, e.g. by [[Colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetry]]. Examples include [[Fehling's reagent]], [[Millon's reagent]], and [[Tollens' reagent]].

==Commercial or laboratory preparations==
In commercial or laboratory preparations, {{anchor|Reagent_grade}}'''[[chemical purity|reagent-grade]]''' designates [[chemical substance]]s meeting [[standardization|standards]] of [[purity (gas)|purity]] that ensure the scientific precision and reliability of [[chemical analysis]], chemical reactions or physical testing. Purity standards for reagents are set by organizations such as [[ASTM International]] or the [[American Chemical Society]]. For instance, reagent-quality water must have very low levels of impurities such as [[sodium]] and [[chloride]] ions, [[silica]], and bacteria, as well as a very high [[electrical resistivity]].  Laboratory products which are ''less'' pure, but still useful and economical for undemanding work, may be designated as ''technical'', ''practical'', or ''crude'' grade to distinguish them from reagent versions.

==Biology==

A '''recognition signal''' is a [[wikt:signal|signal]] whereby a person, a [[ship]], an [[airplane]] or something else is [[wikt:recognize|recognize]]d. They can be used during war or can be used to help the police recognize each other during [[wikt:undercover|undercover]] [[wikt:operation|operation]]s. It can also be used in [[biology]] to signal that a [[molecule]] or [[chemical]] is to be [[wikt:bound|bound]] to another molecule.

==War==
These signals are often used to recognize friends and enemies in a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/gnto0400.htm | title=German Navy Tactical Orders (Enemy Recognition Signals)|access-date=2009-02-18|author=Commander-in-Chief High Sea Fleet (German navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Visual signals: Military communication without words|url=https://www.hprc-online.org/social-fitness/teams-leadership/visual-signals-military-communication-without-words|access-date=2022-02-10|website=HPRC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[military]] use these signals often use colored lights or the [[International marine signal flags]]

{{Genetic engineering sidebar}}

'''Recombinant DNA''' ('''rDNA''') molecules are [[DNA]] molecules formed by laboratory methods of [[genetic recombination]] (such as [[molecular cloning]]) that bring together genetic material from multiple sources, creating [[DNA sequence|sequences]] that would not otherwise be found in the [[genome]].

Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by combining at least two fragments from  two different sources. Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA molecules from all organisms share the same chemical structure, and differ only in the [[nucleotide]] sequence within that identical overall structure. Recombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called '''chimeric DNA''', because they can be made of material from two different species, like the mythical [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]. R-DNA technology uses [[palindromic sequence]]s and leads to the production of [[sticky and blunt ends]].

The DNA sequences used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules can originate from any [[species]]. For example, plant DNA may be joined to bacterial DNA, or human DNA may be joined with fungal DNA. In addition, DNA sequences that do not occur anywhere in nature may be created by the [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|chemical synthesis of DNA]], and incorporated into recombinant molecules. Using recombinant DNA technology and synthetic DNA, literally any DNA sequence may be created and introduced into any of a very wide range of living organisms.

Proteins that can result from the expression of recombinant DNA within living cells are termed ''recombinant proteins''. When recombinant DNA encoding a protein is introduced into a host organism, the recombinant protein is not necessarily produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rosano|first1=Germán L.|last2=Ceccarelli|first2=Eduardo A.|date=2014-04-17|title=Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli: advances and challenges|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=5|pages=172|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00172|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4029002|pmid=24860555|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructuring by
foreign coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoters used to regulate gene expression|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/promoters/818.html|website=www.cambia.org|access-date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recombinant DNA differs from genetic recombination in that the former results from artificial methods in the test tube, while the latter is a normal biological process that results in the remixing of existing DNA sequences in essentially all organisms.

==DNA creation==

{{main|Molecular cloning}}

Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7167-2866-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two most widely used methods, along with [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), used to direct the replication of any specific DNA sequence chosen by the experimentalist. There are two fundamental differences between the methods. One is that molecular cloning involves replication of the DNA within a living cell, while PCR replicates DNA in the test tube, free of living cells. The other difference is that cloning involves cutting and pasting DNA sequences, while PCR amplifies by copying an existing sequence.

Formation of recombinant DNA requires a [[Vector (molecular biology)|cloning vector]], a DNA molecule that replicates within a living cell. Vectors are generally derived from [[plasmid]]s or [[virus]]es, and represent relatively small segments of DNA that contain necessary genetic signals for replication, as well as additional elements for convenience in inserting foreign DNA, identifying cells that contain recombinant DNA, and, where appropriate, expressing the foreign DNA. The choice of vector for molecular cloning depends on the choice of host organism, the size of the DNA to be cloned, and whether and how the foreign DNA is to be expressed.&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-576-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Russell, David W. |author2=Sambrook, Joseph |title=Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |location=Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-87969-576-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/molecularcloning0000samb_p7p5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA segments can be combined by using a variety of methods, such as restriction enzyme/ligase cloning or [[Gibson assembly]].

In standard cloning protocols, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of host organism and cloning vector, (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into the host organism, (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, and (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-2866-4" /&gt;
''These steps are described in some detail in a related article ([[molecular cloning]]).''

==DNA expression==
{{main|Protein production}}
Following transplantation into the host organism, the foreign DNA contained within the recombinant DNA construct may or may not be [[Gene expression|expressed]]. That is, the DNA may simply be replicated without expression, or it may be [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] and [[Translation (biology)|translated]] and a recombinant protein is produced. Generally speaking, expression of a foreign gene requires restructuring the gene to include sequences that are required for producing an [[mRNA]] molecule that can be used by the host's [[Translation (biology)|translational apparatus]] (e.g. [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence|translational initiation signal]], and [[Terminator (genetics)|transcriptional terminator]]).&lt;ref name="pmid9487731"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Properties of organisms containing recombinant DNA==
In most cases, organisms containing recombinant DNA have apparently normal [[phenotype]]s. That is, their appearance, behavior and metabolism are usually unchanged, and the only way to demonstrate the presence of recombinant sequences is to examine the DNA itself, typically using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Terry |title=Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis: an Introduction |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4051-1121-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant exceptions exist, and are discussed below.

If the rDNA sequences encode a gene that is expressed, then the presence of RNA and/or protein products of the recombinant gene can be detected, typically using [[RT-PCR]] or [[Western blot|western hybridization]] methods.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6"/&gt; Gross phenotypic changes are not the norm, unless the recombinant gene has been chosen and modified so as to generate biological activity in the host organism.&lt;ref name="pmid|10634784"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional phenotypes that are encountered include toxicity to the host organism induced by the recombinant gene product, especially if it is [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|over-expressed]] or expressed within inappropriate cells or tissues.

In some cases, recombinant DNA can have deleterious effects even if it is not expressed. One mechanism by which this happens is [[Insertion (genetics)|insertional inactivation]], in which the rDNA becomes inserted into a host cell's gene. In some cases, researchers use this phenomenon to "[[Gene knockout|knock out]]" genes to determine their biological function and importance.&lt;ref name="pmid1591000"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism by which rDNA insertion into chromosomal DNA can affect gene expression is by inappropriate activation of previously unexpressed host cell genes. This can happen, for example, when a recombinant DNA fragment containing an active promoter becomes located next to a previously silent host cell gene, or when a host cell gene that functions to restrain gene expression undergoes insertional inactivation by recombinant DNA.

==Applications  of recombinant DNA==

Recombinant DNA is widely used in [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]] and [[research]]. Today, recombinant proteins and other products that result from the use of DNA technology are found in essentially every western pharmacy, physician or veterinarian office, medical testing laboratory, and biological research laboratory. In addition, organisms that have been manipulated using recombinant DNA technology, as well as products derived from those organisms, have found their way into many farms, [[Genetically modified food|supermarkets]], [[Humulin|home medicine cabinets]], and even pet shops, such as those that sell [[GloFish]] and other [[genetically modified animal]]s.

The most common application of recombinant DNA is in basic research, in which the technology is important to most current work in the biological and biomedical sciences.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6" /&gt; Recombinant DNA is used to identify, map and sequence genes, and to determine their function. rDNA probes are employed in analyzing gene expression within individual cells, and throughout the tissues of whole organisms. Recombinant proteins are widely used as reagents in laboratory experiments and to generate antibody probes for examining protein synthesis within cells and organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-4111-3" /&gt;

Many additional practical applications of recombinant DNA are found in industry, food production, human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and bioengineering.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-4111-3" /&gt; Some specific examples are identified below.

;Recombinant [[chymosin]] {{not a typo|:}} Found in [[rennet]], chymosin is an enzyme required to manufacture cheese. It was the first genetically engineered food additive used commercially. Traditionally, processors obtained chymosin from rennet, a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk-fed calves. Scientists engineered a non-pathogenic strain (K-12) of ''E. coli'' bacteria for large-scale laboratory production of the enzyme. This microbiologically produced recombinant enzyme, identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme, costs less and is produced in abundant quantities. Today about 60% of U.S. hard cheese is made with genetically engineered chymosin. In 1990, FDA granted chymosin "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS) status based on data showing that the enzyme was safe.&lt;ref&gt;Donna U. Vogt and Mickey Parish.

==History==

The idea of recombinant DNA was first proposed by Peter Lobban, a graduate student of Prof. [[A. Dale Kaiser|Dale Kaiser]] in the Biochemistry Department at Stanford University Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, J. (1978). ''Recombinant DNA: The Untold Story''. New York: Crown Publishers. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The first publications describing the successful production and intracellular replication of recombinant DNA appeared in 1972 and 1973, from [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]].&lt;ref name="pmid|4342968"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Controversy ==
Scientists associated with the initial development of recombinant DNA methods recognized that the potential existed for organisms containing recombinant DNA to have undesirable or dangerous properties. At the 1975 [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]], these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on recombinant DNA research was initiated for experiments that were considered particularly risky. This moratorium was widely observed until the [[National Institutes of Health]] (USA) developed and issued formal guidelines for rDNA work. Today, recombinant DNA molecules and recombinant proteins are usually not regarded as dangerous. However, concerns remain about some organisms that express recombinant DNA, particularly when they leave the laboratory and are introduced into the environment or food chain. These concerns are discussed in the articles on [[genetically modified organism]]s and [[genetically modified food controversies]]. Furthermore, there are concerns about the by-products in biopharmaceutical production, where recombinant DNA result in specific protein products. The major by-product, termed [[host cell protein]], comes from the host expression system and poses a threat to the patient's health and the overall environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Xing|last2=Hunter|first2=Alan K.|last3=Mozier|first3=Ned M.|date=2009-06-15|title=Host cell proteins in biologics development: Identification, quantitation and risk assessment|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=103|issue=3|pages=446–458|doi=10.1002/bit.22304|pmid=19388135|s2cid=22707536|issn=0006-3592|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bracewell|first1=Daniel G.|last2=Francis|first2=Richard|last3=Smales|first3=C.

Operating best at temperatures of 37–42&amp;nbsp;°C and still working, albeit more slowly, at room temperature means RPA reactions can in theory be run quickly simply by holding a tube. This makes RPA an excellent candidate for developing low-cost, rapid, point-of-care molecular tests. An international quality assessment of molecular detection of [[Rift Valley fever virus]] performed as well as the best RT-PCR tests, detecting less concentrated samples missed by some PCR tests and an [[Reverse_Transcription_Loop-mediated_Isothermal_Amplification|RT-LAMP]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002244 |title=International External Quality Assessment of Molecular Detection of Rift Valley Fever Virus |year=2013 |editor1-last=De Silva |editor1-first=Aravinda M |last1=Escadafal |first1=Camille |last2=Paweska |first2=Janusz T. |last3=Grobbelaar |first3=Antoinette |last4=Le Roux |first4=Chantel |last5=Bouloy |first5=Michèle |last6=Patel |first6=Pranav |last7=Teichmann |first7=Anette |last8=Donoso-Mantke |first8=Oliver |last9=Niedrig |first9=Matthias |journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e2244 |pmid=23717706 |pmc=3662703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
RPA was developed and launched by TwistDx Ltd. (formerly known as ASM Scientific Ltd), a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, UK.

==Technique==

The RPA process employs three core [[enzymes]] – a [[recombinase]], a [[Single-strand binding protein|single-stranded DNA-binding protein]] (SSB) and strand-displacing [[polymerase]]. 

Recombinases are capable of pairing [[oligonucleotide]] primers with homologous sequence in duplex DNA.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg et al 2006" /&gt; 

SSB bind to displaced strands of DNA and prevent the [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] from being displaced. 

Finally, the strand displacing polymerase begins [[DNA synthesis]] where the primer has bound to the target DNA. 

By using two opposing primers, much like PCR, if the target sequence is indeed present, an exponential [[DNA amplification]] reaction is initiated. No other sample manipulation such as thermal or chemical melting is required to initiate amplification. At optimal temperatures (37–42&amp;nbsp;°C), the reaction progresses rapidly and results in specific DNA amplification from just a few target copies to detectable levels, typically within 10 minutes, for rapid detection of viral genomic DNA or RNA,&lt;ref name="Euler et al 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amer et al 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abd El Wahed et al 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/mBio.00135-13 |title=Rapid Detection of HIV-1 Proviral DNA for Early Infant Diagnosis Using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification |year=2013 |last1=Boyle |first1=D.

The three core RPA enzymes can be supplemented by further enzymes to provide extra functionality. Addition of [[exonuclease III]] allows the use of an exo probe for real-time, fluorescence detection akin to real-time PCR.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg et al 2006" /&gt; Addition of [[endonuclease]] IV means that a nfo probe can be used for [[Lateral flow test|lateral flow strip detection]] of successful amplification.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg et al 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle et al 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/c2lc40423k |title=A paper and plastic device for performing recombinase polymerase amplification of HIV DNA |year=2012 |last1=Rohrman |first1=Brittany A. |last2=Richards-Kortum |first2=Rebecca R. |journal=Lab on a Chip |volume=12 |issue=17 |pages=3082–8 |pmid=22733333 |pmc=3569001}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a reverse transcriptase that works at 37–42&amp;nbsp;°C is added then RNA can be reverse transcribed and the cDNA produced amplified all in one step. Currently only the TwistAmp exo version of RPA is available with the reverse transcriptase included, although users can simply supplement other TwistAmp reactions with a reverse transcriptase to produce the same effect.
As with PCR, all forms of RPA reactions can be [[multiplexed]] by the addition of further primer/probe pairs, allowing the detection of multiple analytes or an internal control in the same tube.

==Relationship to other amplification techniques==
RPA is one of several isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques to be developed as a molecular diagnostic technique, frequently with the objective of simplifying the laboratory instrumentation required relative to [[PCR]].  A partial list of other isothermal amplification techniques include [[Loop-mediated isothermal amplification|LAMP]], [[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]], [[helicase-dependent amplification]] (HDA), and [[nicking enzyme amplification reaction]] (NEAR).  The techniques differ in the specifics of primer design and reaction mechanism, and in some cases (like RPA) make use of cocktails of two or more enzymes.  Like RPA, many of these techniques offer rapid amplification times with the potential for simplified instrumentation, and reported resistance to substances in unpurified samples that are known to inhibit PCR.  With respect to amplification time, modern thermocyclers with rapid temperature ramps can reduce PCR amplification times to less than 30 minutes, particularly for short amplicons using dual-temperature cycling rather than the conventional three-temperature protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dna.utah.edu/RapidPCR/Top_Rapid_PCR.html |title=Rapid PCR |publisher=Dna.utah.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the demands of sample prep (including lysis and extraction of DNA or RNA, if necessary) should be considered as part of the overall time and complexity inherent to the technique.  These requirements vary according to the technique as well as to the specific target and sample type.

Compared to PCR, the guidelines for primer and probe design for RPA are less established, and may take a certain degree of trial and error, although recent results indicate that standard PCR primers can work as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twistdx.co.uk/products/general_rd_kits/twistamp_basic/pcr_primers_work_using_standard_rpa_reagents |title=PCR primers work using standard RPA reagents |publisher=TwistDx |date= |accessdate=2015-10-19 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general principle of a discrete amplicon bounded by a forward and reverse primer with an (optional) internal fluorogenic probe is similar to PCR. PCR primers may be used directly in RPA, but their short length means that recombination rates are low and RPA will not be especially sensitive or fast. Typically 30–38 base primers are needed for efficient recombinase filament formation and RPA performance. This is in contrast to some other techniques such as LAMP which use a larger number of primers subject to additional design constraints.  Although the original 2006 report of RPA describes a functional set of reaction components, the current (proprietary) formulation of the TwistAmp kit is "substantially different" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twistdx.co.uk/resources/publications/ |title=Publications |publisher=TwistDx |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available only from the TwistDx supplier.  This is in comparison to reaction mixtures for [[PCR]] which are available from many suppliers, or [[Loop-mediated isothermal amplification|LAMP]] or [[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]] for which the composition of the reaction mixture is freely published, allowing researchers to create their own customized "kits" from inexpensive ingredients.

Published scientific literature generally lacks detailed comparison of the performance of isothermal amplification techniques such as RPA, HDA, and LAMP relative to each other, often rather comparing a single isothermal technique to a "gold standard" PCR assay.  This makes it difficult to judge the merits of these techniques independently from the claims of the manufacturers, inventors, or proponents. Furthermore, performance characteristics of any amplification technique are difficult to decouple from primer design: a "good" primer set for one target for RPA may give faster amplification or more sensitive detection than a "poor" LAMP primer set for the same target, but the converse may be true for different primer sets for a different target. An exception is a recent study comparing RT-qPCR, RT-LAMP, and RPA for detection of Schmallenberg virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus,&lt;ref name="Aebischer 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aebischer|first1=Andrea|title=Rapid Genome Detection of Schmallenberg Virus and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus by Use of Isothermal Amplification Methods and High-Speed Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR|journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology|date=2014|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1883–92|doi=10.1128/JCM.00167-14|pmid=24648561|pmc=4042763}}&lt;/ref&gt; which effectively makes the point that each amplification technique has strengths and weaknesses, which may vary by the target, and that the properties of the available amplification techniques need to be evaluated in combination with the requirements for each application.  As with PCR and any other amplification technique, there is obviously a publication bias, with poorly performing primer sets rarely deemed worthy of reporting.

'''Red edge''' refers to the region of rapid change in [[reflectance]] of [[vegetation]] in the [[near infrared]] range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. [[Chlorophyll]] contained in vegetation absorbs most of the light in the visible part of the spectrum but becomes almost transparent at wavelengths greater than 700 [[nanometer|nm]]. The cellular structure of the vegetation then causes this infrared light to be reflected because each [[Cell (biology)|cell]] acts something like an elementary [[corner reflector]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} The change can be from 5% to 50% reflectance going from 680 nm to 730 nm. This is an advantage to plants in avoiding overheating during [[photosynthesis]]. For a more detailed explanation and a graph of the [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (PAR) spectral region, see {{slink|Normalized difference vegetation index|Rationale}}.

The phenomenon accounts for the brightness of foliage in [[infrared photography]] and is extensively utilized in the form of so-called vegetation indices (e.g. [[Normalized difference vegetation index]]). It is used in [[remote sensing]] to monitor plant activity, and it has been suggested that it could be useful to detect light-harvesting organisms on distant planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Seager | first1=S. | last2=Turner | first2=E.L. | last3=Schafer | first3=J. | last4=Ford | first4=E.B. | year=2005 | title=Vegetation's Red Edge: A Possible Spectroscopic Biosignature of Extraterrestrial Plants | journal=Astrobiology | pmid=15941381 | volume=5 | issue=3 | pages=372–390 | doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.372 | bibcode=2005AsBio...5..372S |arxiv = astro-ph/0503302 | s2cid=11589855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

''Osservazioni intorno alle vipere'' (''Observations about the Viper'') written by an Italian polymath [[Francesco Redi]] in 1664 is regarded as the milestone in the beginning of toxinology research. Redi was the first scientist to elucidate the scientific basis of [[snakebite]] and venom of the [[viper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Francesco Redi |editor=Knoefel PK  |title= Francesco Redi on Vipers |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5w8VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg|access-date= 2013-04-18 |year= 1988  |publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden, the Netherlands  |pages=11–17 |isbn= 9004089489}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed for the first time that the viper venom comes from the [[fang]], not the [[gallbladder]] as it was believed; that it is not poisonous when swallowed, and effective only when it enters the  [[blood circulation|bloodstream]].&lt;ref name=hab&gt;{{cite journal |author= Habermehl GG|title= Francesco Redi—life and work|year= 1994 |volume=32  |issue=4  |pages=411–417|pmid=8052995 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(94)90292-5 |journal=Toxicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even demonstrated the possibility of slowing down the venom action in the blood by tight [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] before the wound. This work is heralded as the foundation of [[toxinology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hayes AN, Gilbert SG |title= Historical milestones and discoveries that shaped the toxicology sciences| journal= EXS|year=2009| volume=99 |issue=1 |pages= 1–35|pmid= 19157056 |doi=10.1007/978-3-7643-8336-7_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of the pioneer, the International Society on Toxinology (ISI) instituted the ''Redi Award'' in 1967 in recognition of scientists for their significant contributions in toxinology research.&lt;ref name=meb/&gt;

==Nature of the award==

The IST awards scientists or clinicians who have made outstanding contributions to the field of toxinology. The award is given at each World Congress of the Society, which is generally held every three years. It is the highest award bestowed by the society and the most prestigious in the world for toxinologists. Selection for the award is made by the Redi Award Committee chaired by the editor of ''[[Toxicon]]'' (the official journal of IST) and accompanied by past and present Executive Officers of the society and former Redi awardees. The result is only announced at the World Congress. The recipient is then invited to present a lecture of his/her own choosing, officially called the Redi Lecture, to the congress.&lt;ref name=hab /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title=IST Redi Awards |url= http://www.toxinology.org/IST_RediAward.htm | access-date=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Award consists of a framed citation describing the merits of the awardee and a financial assistance to help cover expenses associated with attendance at the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title= International Society on Toxinology By-Laws Article X|url= http://www.toxinology.org/resources/IST%20Constitution-Revised120713.pdf | access-date=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples are numerous: disproportionate numbers of [[spermatozoa]] during [[fertilization]] compared to one egg, large number of [[neurotransmitter]]s released during [[neuronal]] communication compared to the number of [[Cell surface receptor|receptor]]s, large numbers of released [[calcium]] ions during transient in cells and many more in molecular and cellular [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] or [[gene activation]] and [[cell signaling]]. This redundancy is particularly relevant when the sites of activation is physically separated from the initial position of the molecular messengers. The redundancy is often generated for the purpose of resolving the time constraint of fast-activating pathways. It can be expressed in terms of the theory of extreme statistics to determine its laws and quantify how shortest paths are selected. The main goal is to estimate these large numbers from physical principles and mathematical derivations.

When large distance separate the source and the target (a small activation site), the redundancy principle explains that this geometrical gap can be compensated by large number. Had nature used less copies than normal,  activation would have taken a much longer time, as finding a small target by chance is a [[rare events]] and falls into [[narrow escape problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Holcman, David, author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1022084107|title=Asymptotics of elliptic and parabolic PDEs : and their applications in statistical physics, computational neuroscience, and biophysics|date=6 June 2018|isbn=978-3-319-76894-6|oclc=1022084107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Molecular rate ==
The time for the fastest particles to reach a target in the context of redundancy depends on the numbers and the local geometry of the target. In most of the time, it is the rate of activation. This rate should be used instead of the classical [[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]]'s rate describing the mean arrival time, but not the fastest. The statistics of the minimal time to activation set kinetic laws in biology, which can be quite different from the ones associated to average times.

== Mathematical formulation: Computing the rate of arrival time for the fastest ==
The mathematical analysis of large numbers of molecules, which are obviously redundant in the traditional activation theory, is used to compute the in vivo time scale of  [[Chemical reaction|stochastic chemical reactions]]. The computation relies on asymptotics or probabilistic approaches to estimate the mean time of the fastest to reach a small target in various geometries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=J. |last2=Kupka |first2=I. |last3=Schuss |first3=Z. |last4=Holcman |first4=D. |title=Search for a small egg by spermatozoa in restricted geometries |journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology |date=26 December 2015 |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=423–446 |doi=10.1007/s00285-015-0955-3 |pmid=26707857 |pmc=4940446 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=George H. |last2=Shuler |first2=Kurt E. |last3=Lindenberg |first3=Katja |author3-link= Katja Lindenberg |title=Order statistics for first passage times in diffusion processes |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |date=May 1983 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=255–278 |doi=10.1007/BF01011582 |bibcode=1983JSP....31..255W |s2cid=121208316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Basnayake |first1=K. |last2=Hubl |first2=A. |last3=Schuss |first3=Z. |last4=Holcman |first4=D. |title=Extreme Narrow Escape: Shortest paths for the first particles among n to reach a target window |journal=Physics Letters A |date=December 2018 |volume=382 |issue=48 |pages=3449–3454 |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2018.09.040 |bibcode=2018PhLA..382.3449B |s2cid=125796251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With N  non-interacting i.i.d. Brownian trajectories (ions) in a bounded domain Ω  that bind at a site, the shortest arrival time  is by definition

&lt;math&gt;
\tau^{1}=\min (t_1,\ldots,t_N),
&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;  are the independent arrival times of the N ions in the medium.  The survival distribution of arrival time of the fastest  &lt;math&gt;Pr(\tau^{1}&gt;t)&lt;/math&gt;   is expressed in terms of a single particle, &lt;math&gt;
Pr(\tau^{1}&gt;t)=Pr^N(t_1&gt;t)
&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t \}&lt;/math&gt; is the survival probability of a single particle prior to binding at the target.This probability is computed from the solution of the [[diffusion equation]] in a domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} =D \Delta p(x,t) \hbox { for } x \in \Omega, t&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
p(x,0)=&amp;p_0(x) \hbox{ for } x \in \Omega \\
\frac{\partial p}{\partial n}(x,t) &amp;=0 \hbox{ for } x \in \partial \Omega_r\\
p(x,t)&amp;=0  \hbox{ for } x \in \partial \Omega_a,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; contains NR binding sites &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega_i\subset\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega_a=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{N_R}\partial\Omega_i,\ \partial\Omega_r=\partial\Omega-\partial\Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;). The  single particle survival probability is

&lt;math&gt;
\Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t \} =\int\limits_{\Omega} p(x,t)dx,
&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;
\Pr\{\tau^{1}=t \} = \frac{d}{dt}\Pr\{\tau^{1}&lt;t \}=N(\Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t \})^{N-1}\Pr\limits\{t_{1}=t
\},
&lt;/math&gt;where

&lt;math&gt;
\Pr\{t_{1}=t \}=  {\oint_{\partial \Omega_a}} \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial n}\, dS_{x}
&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\Pr\{t_{1}=t \}= N_R {\oint_{\partial \Omega_1}} \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial n}\,dS_{x} &lt;/math&gt;.

The probability density function (pdf) of the arrival time is

&lt;math&gt;
\Pr\{\tau^{1}=t \} =N N_R  \left[\int\limits_{\Omega} p(x,t)dx \right]^{N-1}\oint\limits_{\partial \Omega_1} \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial n} dS_{x},
&lt;/math&gt; which gives the MFPT

&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\tau}^{1}=\int\limits\limits_0 ^{\infty}\Pr\{\tau^{1}&gt;t\} dt = \int\limits_0 ^{\infty} \left[ \Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t\} \right]^N dt.
&lt;/math&gt; The probability  &lt;math&gt;\Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t \}&lt;/math&gt; can be computed using short-time asymptotics of the diffusion equation as shown in the next sections.

== Explicit computation in dimension 1 ==
The short-time asymptotic of the diffusion equation is based on the ray method approximation. For an semi-interval  &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty[&lt;/math&gt;, the survival pdf is solution of

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial (x,t)}{\partial t}&amp; =D \frac{\partial^2 p(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\quad\mbox{ for } x&gt;0,\ t&gt;0 \\
p(x,0)&amp;=\delta(x-a)\quad\mbox{ for }\ x&gt;0,\quad p(0,t)=0\quad\mbox{ for } t&gt;0,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

that is&lt;math&gt;p(x,t) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{4D \pi t}}\left[\exp\left\{ - \frac{(x-a)^2}{4Dt}\right\}- \exp\left\{ - \frac{(x+a)^2}{4Dt}\right\}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The survival probability with D=1 is &lt;math&gt;\Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t \}=\int\limits\limits_{0}^{\infty} p(x,t)\,dx=1-\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int\limits\limits_{a/\sqrt{4t}}^{\infty}e^{-u^2}\,du &lt;/math&gt;. To compute the MFPT, we expand the complementary error function

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int\limits\limits_{x}^{\infty}e^{-u^2}\,du =\frac{e^{-x^2}}{x\sqrt{\pi}}\left(1-\frac{1}{2x^2}+O(x^{-4})\right)\quad\mbox{for}\ x\gg1, &lt;/math&gt; which gives&lt;math&gt;\bar{\tau}^{1}=\int\limits\limits_0 ^{\infty} \left[ \Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t\} \right]^N dt \approx \int\limits\limits_0 ^{\infty} \exp\left\{ N\ln\left(1-\frac{e^{-(a/\sqrt{4t})^2}}{(a/\sqrt{4t})\sqrt{\pi}}\right)\right\}\, dt \approx \frac{a^2}{4}\int\limits\limits_0^{\infty} \exp \left\{ -N\frac{\sqrt{u}e^{-\frac{1}{u}}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \right\}du &lt;/math&gt;,

leading (the main contribution of the integral is near 0) to &lt;math&gt;\bar{\tau}^{1} \approx \frac{a^2}{4D\ln \frac{N}{\sqrt{\pi}}}\quad\mbox{for}\ N\gg1. &lt;/math&gt;

This result is reminiscent of using the Gumbel's law.  Similarly, escape from the interval [0,a] is computed from the infinite sum

&lt;math&gt;p(x,t\,|\,y) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 4 D \pi t}}\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \left[\exp \left\{ -\frac{(x-y+2na)^2}{4t} \right\} -\exp \left\{ -\frac{(x+y+2na)^2}{4t} \right\} \right] &lt;/math&gt;.The conditional survival probability is approximated by&lt;ref name=pmid30691960/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t\,|\,y \}=\int\limits\limits_{0}^{a} p(x,t\,|\,y)\,dx ds\sim1-\max\frac{2\sqrt{t}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left[\frac{e^{-y^2/4t}}{y},\frac{e^{-(a-y)^2/4t}}{a-y}\right] \quad\mbox{as}\ t\to0
 &lt;/math&gt;, where the maximum occurs at &lt;math&gt;\delta= &lt;/math&gt; min[y,a-y] for &lt;nowiki&gt;0&lt;y&lt;a&lt;/nowiki&gt; (the shortest ray from y to the boundary). All other integrals can be computed explicitly, leading to

&lt;math&gt;\bar{\tau}^{1}= \int\limits\limits_0 ^{\infty} \left[ \Pr\{t_{1}&gt;t\} \right]^N dt \approx 
\int\limits\limits_0 ^{\infty} \exp\left\{ N\ln\left(1-\frac{8\sqrt{t}}{\delta\sqrt{\pi}}
e^{-\delta^2/16t}\right) \right\}dt \approx \frac{\delta^2}{16D\ln\frac{2N}{\sqrt{\pi}}}\quad\mbox{for}\ N\gg1. &lt;/math&gt;

== Arrival times of the fastest in higher dimensions ==
The arrival times of the fastest among many [[Brownian motion]]s  are expressed in terms of the shortest distance from the source S to the absorbing window A, measured by the distance &lt;math&gt;\delta_{min}=d(S,A),&lt;/math&gt;where d is the associated [[Euclidean distance]]. Interestingly, trajectories followed by the fastest are as close as possible from  the optimal trajectories. In technical language, the associated trajectories of the fastest among N, concentrate near the optimal trajectory (shortest path) when the number N of particles increases. For a diffusion coefficient D and a window of size a, the expected first arrival times of N identically independent distributed Brownian particles initially positioned at the source S are expressed in the following asymptotic formulas :

&lt;math&gt;
\bar\tau^{d1} \approx \frac{\delta^2_{min}}{4D\ln\left(\frac{N}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right)}, \hbox{in  dim  1, valid for} N \gg1
,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
 \bar \tau^{d2} \approx  \frac{\delta^2_{min}}{ 4 D \log \left(\frac{\pi
\sqrt{2}N}{8\log\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)}\right)}, \hbox{ in  dim 2 for } \frac{N}{\log (\frac{1}{\epsilon})}\gg1,  
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\bar\tau^{d3} \approx \frac{\delta^2_{min}}{4D{\log\left(
N\frac{4a^2}{\pi^{1/2}\delta^2_{min}}\right)}}, \hbox{ in dim } 3, \hbox{  for } \frac{Na^2}{\delta^2_{min}}\gg1.
&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas show that the expected arrival time of the fastest particle is in dimension 1 and 2, O(1/\log(N)). They should be used instead of the classical forward rate in models of activation in biochemical reactions. The method to derive formulas is based on short-time asymptotic and the Green's function representation of the Helmholtz equation. Note that other distributions could lead to other decays with respect N.

== Optimal Paths ==
=== Minimizing  The optimal path in large N ===
The optimal paths for the fastest can be found using the Wencell-Freidlin functional in the Large-deviation theory.  These paths correspond to the short-time asymptotics of the diffusion equation from a source to a target. In general, the exact solution is hard to find, especially for a space containing various distribution of obstacles.

The [[Wiener integral]] representation of the pdf for a pure Brownian motion is obtained for a zero drift and diffusion tensor &lt;math&gt;\sigma=D&lt;/math&gt; constant, so that it is given by the probability of a sampled path until it exits at the small window &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;at the random time T

&lt;math&gt;Pr\{ x_N(t_{1,M})\in\Omega,{x}_N(t_{2,M})\in\Omega,\dots, x_M(t)=x, t\leq T\leq t+\Delta t |x(0)=y\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=[\int\limits_{\Omega} \cdots \int\limits\limits_{\Omega}\prod_{j=1}^{M} \frac{d{y}_j}{\sqrt{(2\pi \Delta t)^n\det {\sigma}(x)(t_{j-1,M}))}}
\exp \{ -\frac{1}{2\Delta t} \left[{y}_j-x(t_{j-1,N})- {a}({x}(t_{j-1,N}))\Delta t \right]^T{\sigma}^{-1}(x(t_{j-1,N}))\left[{y}_j-x(t_{j-1,N})-{a}(x(t_{j-1,N}))\Delta t \right]\}
 
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\Delta t=t/M, t_{j,N}=j\Delta t,\ x(t_{0,N})=y \hbox{ and } {y}_j=x(t_{j,N})&lt;/math&gt; in the product and T is the exit time in the narrow absorbing window &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega_a.&lt;/math&gt; Finally,

&lt;math&gt;\langle\tau^{(n)}\rangle=\int\limits\limits_0 ^{\infty}\exp \left\{ n \log \int\limits_{\Omega} p(x,t|y)\,dx\right\} dt =\int_0 ^{\infty} \tau_{\sigma} Pr\{ \hbox{ Path }\sigma \in S_n (y), \tau_{\sigma}=t \} dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_n(y)&lt;/math&gt; is the ensemble of shortest paths selected among n Brownian trajectories, starting at point y and exiting between time t and t+dt from the domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. The probability&lt;math&gt;Pr\{ \hbox{ Path }\sigma \in S_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is used to show that the empirical stochastic trajectories of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; concentrate near the shortest paths starting from y and ending at the small absorbing window &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;, under the condition that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\frac{|\partial \Omega_a|}{|\partial\Omega|} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;.  The paths of &lt;math&gt;S_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;  can be approximated using discrete broken lines among a finite number of points and we denote the associated ensemble by &lt;math&gt;\tilde S_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;.  Bayes' rule leads to&lt;math&gt;Pr\{ \hbox{ Path }\sigma \in \tilde S_n(y)| t&lt;\tau_{\sigma}&lt;t+dt \}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}

Pr\{ \hbox{ Path }\sigma \in \tilde S_n(y)|m, t&lt;\tau_{\sigma}&lt;t+dt \}Pr\{ m \mbox{ steps}\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Pr\{ m \mbox{ steps}\}=Pr\{ \mbox{the paths of }\tilde S_n(y) \mbox{exit in m steps} \}&lt;/math&gt;  is the probability that a path of &lt;math&gt;\tilde S_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;  exits in m-discrete time steps. A path made of broken lines (random walk with a time step&lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;) can be expressed using Wiener path-integral.  The probability of a Brownian path x(s) can be expressed in the limit of a path-integral with the functional:

&lt;math&gt;Pr\{ x(s)| s\in[0,t] \} \approx \exp \left(-\int_{0}^t |\dot x|^2ds \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Survival probability conditioned on starting at y is given by the Wiener representation:

&lt;math&gt;S(t|x_0)= \int_{x\in \Omega} dx \int_{x(0)}^{x(t)=x} {\mathcal D} (x)\exp \left(-\int_{0}^t |\dot x|^2ds \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal D} (x)&lt;/math&gt; is the limit Wiener measure: the exterior integral is taken over all end points x and the path integral is over all paths starting from x(0). When we consider n-independent paths &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_1,..\sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt; (made of points with a time step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; that exit in m-steps, the probability of such an event is

&lt;math&gt; Pr \{ \sigma_1,..\sigma_n \in S_n(y)|m, \tau_{\sigma}=m \Delta t \}=  
 
 \left(\int\limits_{y_0=y}  \cdots \int\limits_{{y}_j \in\Omega}
 \int\limits_{{y}_n\in \partial \Omega_a}  \frac{1}{(4D\Delta t)^{dm/2}}\prod_{j=1}^{m} \exp 
\Bigg \{ -\frac{1}{4D\Delta t} \left[|{y}_j-{y}_{j-1})|^2 \right] \}
\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\approx \left(\frac{1}{(4D\Delta t)^{dm/2}}\right)^n\int_{x} {\mathcal D}
(x)\exp \Bigg \{-n\int\limits_0^{m \Delta t} \dot{x}^2ds \Bigg \} &lt;/math&gt;.Indeed, when there are n paths of m steps, and the fastest one escapes in m-steps, they should all exit in m steps. Using the limit of path integral, we get heuristically the representation

&lt;math&gt;Pr \{ \hbox{ Path }\sigma \in \tilde S_n(y)|m, \tau_{\sigma}=m \Delta t \}= \left(\int\limits_{{y}_0=y} \cdots \int\limits_{{y}_j \in\Omega}\int\limits_{{y}_n\in\partial\Omega_a} \frac{1}{(4D\Delta t)^{dm/2}}\prod_{j=1}^{m} \exp ( -\frac{1}{4D\Delta t} \left[|{y}_j-{y}_{j-1})|^2 \right])\right)^n 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\approx \int_{ x \in \Omega } dx \int_{x(0)=y}^{x(t)=x} {D} (x)\exp (-n \int\limits_0^{m \Delta t} \dot{x}^2ds ) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken over all paths starting at y(0) and exiting at time &lt;math&gt;m\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. This formula suggests that when n is large, only the paths that minimize the integrant will contribute. For large n, this formula suggests that paths that will contribute the most are the ones that will minimize the exponent, which allows selecting the paths for which the energy functional is minimal, that is

&lt;math&gt;E=\min_{X\in \mathcal P_t}\int\limits_0^T \dot{x}^2ds,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration is taken over the ensemble of regular paths&lt;math&gt;\mathcal P_t&lt;/math&gt; inside &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; starting at y and exiting in &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;, defined as

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal P_T=\{ P(0)=y, P(T)\in \partial \Omega_a \hbox{ and } P(s) \in \Omega \hbox{ and }  0\leq s\leq T\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formal argument shows that the random paths associated to the fastest exit time are concentrated near the shortest paths. Indeed, the Euler-Lagrange equations for the extremal problem are the classical [[geodesic]]s between y and a point in the narrow window &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Fastest escape from a cusp in two dimensions ===

The formula for the fastest escape can generalize to the case where the absorbing window is located in funnel cusp and the initial particles are distributed outside the cusp. The cusp has a size &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;  in the opening and a curvature R. The diffusion coefficient is D.  The shortest arrival time, valid for large n is given by  &lt;math&gt;\tau^{(n)} \approx  \frac{\pi^2 R^3}{4\epsilon D (\frac{1-\cos(c\sqrt{\tilde \epsilon})}{\tilde\epsilon })^2 \log(\frac{2n}{\sqrt{\pi}})}. &lt;/math&gt; Here&lt;math&gt;\tilde \epsilon=\frac{\epsilon}{R}&lt;/math&gt;and c is a constant that depends on the diameter of the domain. The time taken by the first arrivers is proportional to the reciprocal of the size of the narrow target  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; . This formula is derived for fixed geometry and large n and not in the opposite limit of large n and small epsilon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Basnayake |first1=K. |last2=Holcman |first2=D. |title=Extreme escape from a cusp: When does geometry matter for the fastest Brownian particles moving in crowded cellular environments? |journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |date=7 April 2020 |volume=152 |issue=13 |pages=134104 |doi=10.1063/5.0002030 |pmid=32268749 |arxiv=1912.10142 |s2cid=209444822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concluding remarks ==
How nature sets the disproportionate numbers of particles remain unclear, but can be found using the theory of diffusion. One example is the number of neurotransmitters around 2000 to 3000 released during synaptic transmission, that are set to compensate the low copy number of receptors, so the probability of activation is restored to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reingruber |first1=Jürgen |last2=Holcman |first2=David |title=The Narrow Escape Problem in a Flat Cylindrical Microdomain with Application to Diffusion in the Synaptic Cleft |journal=Multiscale Modeling &amp; Simulation |date=April 2011 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=793–816 |doi=10.1137/100807612 |arxiv=1104.1090 |citeseerx=10.1.1.703.3467 |s2cid=15907625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holcman |first1=David |last2=Schuss |first2=Zeev |title=Stochastic Narrow Escape in Molecular and Cellular Biology: Analysis and Applications |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4939-3103-3 }}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In natural processes these large numbers should not be considered wasteful, but are necessary for generating the fastest possible response and make possible rare events that otherwise would never happen. This property is universal, ranging from the molecular scale to the population level.&lt;ref name="Schuss 52–79"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schuss|first1=Z.|last2=Basnayake|first2=K.|last3=Holcman|first3=D.|date=March 2019|title=Redundancy principle and the role of extreme statistics in molecular and cellular biology|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2019.01.001|journal=Physics of Life Reviews|volume=28|pages=52–79|doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2019.01.001|pmid=30691960|bibcode=2019PhLRv..28...52S|s2cid=59341971 |issn=1571-0645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nature's strategy for optimizing the response time is not necessarily defined by the physics of the motion of an individual particle, but rather by the extreme statistics, that select the shortest paths. In addition, the search for a small activation site selects the particle to arrive first: although these trajectories are rare, they are the ones that set the time scale. We may need to reconsider our estimation toward numbers when punctioning nature in agreement with the redundant principle that quantifies the request to achieve the biological function.&lt;ref name="Schuss 52–79"/&gt;

The refractory group includes elements and compounds like metals and [[silicates]] (commonly termed rocks) which make up the bulk of the mass of the [[terrestrial planet]]s and asteroids in the inner belt. A fraction of the mass of other [[asteroids]], giant planets, their moons and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s is also made of refractory materials.&lt;ref name=Beatty&gt;{{cite book

==Classification==

The [[Chemical element|elements]] can be divided into several categories:

{| class="wikitable"
|'''Category'''
|'''Condensation temperatures'''
|'''Elements'''
|-
|Super-refractory
|higher than 1700 K
|Re, Os, W, Zr and Hf

|-
|Refractory
|between 1500 and 1700 K
|Al, Sc, Ca, Ti, Th, Lu, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Ir, Ru, Mo, U, Sm, Nd and  La

|-
|Moderately refractory
|1300 to 1500 K
|Nb, Be, V, Ce, Yb, Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Mg, Eu, Si, Cr

|-
|Moderately volatile
|1100–1300 K
|Au, P, Li, Sr, Mn, Cu and Ba

|-
|Volatile
|700–1100 K
|Rb, Cs, K, Ag, Na, B, Ga, Sn, Se and S
|-
|Very volatile
|less than 700 K
|Zn, Pb, In, Bi and Tl
|}&lt;ref name=Ross/&gt;

The condensation temperatures are the temperatures at which 50% of the element will be in the form of a solid (rock) under a pressure of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[bar (unit)|bar]]. However, slightly different groups and temperature ranges are used sometimes. Refractory material are also often divided into refractory [[Goldschmidt classification#Lithophile elements|lithophile elements]] and refractory [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|siderophile elements]].&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book

'''Regeneration''' is the ability for a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], or [[organism]] to recover from damage. It can also be used to describe the ability of an [[ecosystem]]{{snd}}specifically, the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and its living [[population]]{{snd}}to renew and recover from damage.

Regeneration refers to ecosystems replenishing what is being eaten, disturbed, or harvested. Regeneration's biggest force is [[photosynthesis]] which transforms sun energy and nutrients into plant biomass. [[Resilience (ecology)|Resilience]] to minor [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] is one characteristic feature of healthy ecosystems. Following major (lethal) disturbances, such as a [[forest fire|fire]] or pest outbreak in a forest, an immediate return to the previous [[dynamic equilibrium]] will not be possible. Instead, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Dietze08"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | last1=Dietze | first1=M.

S. | title=Changing the gap dynamics paradigm: Vegetative regenerative control on forest response to disturbance | journal=Ecological Monographs | volume=78 | issue=3 | pages=331–347 | url=http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/10300.pdf | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey02"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00564-3 | last1=Bailey | first1=J.

In certain regions like [[Bushfires in Australia|Australia]], natural [[wildfire]] is a necessary condition for a cyclically [[Ecological stability|stable ecosystem]] with cyclic regeneration.

==Artificial disturbances==
While natural disturbances are usually fully compensated by the rules of ecological succession, human interference can significantly alter the regenerative [[homeostatic]] faculties of an ecosystem up to a degree that [[self-healing]] will not be possible. For regeneration to occur, active [[restoration ecology|restoration]] must be attempted.

      <text bytes="2831" xml:space="preserve">The '''Registry of Standard Biological Parts''' is a collection of genetic parts that are used in the assembly of systems and devices in [[synthetic biology]]. The registry was founded in 2003 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. The registry, as of 2018, contains over 20,000 parts. Recipients of the genetic parts include academic labs, established scientists, and student teams participating in [[International Genetically Engineered Machine|the iGEM Foundation]]'s annual synthetic biology competition.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, Eric. [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33728433 Bright bacteria wins synthetic biology contest.] ''[[NBC News]].'' 6 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Registry of Standard Biological Parts conforms to the [[BioBrick]] standard, a standard for interchangeable genetic parts. BioBrick was developed by a nonprofit composed of researchers from [[MIT]], [[Harvard]], and [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]]. The registry offers genetic parts with the expectation that recipients will contribute data and new parts to improve the resource. The registry records and indexes biological parts and offers services including the synthesis and assembly of biological parts, systems, and devices.

The registry offers many types of biological parts, including [[DNA]], [[plasmid]]s, plasmid backbones, [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[promotor (biology)|promoter]]s, protein coding sequences, [[protein domain]]s, [[ribosomal binding site]]s, [[Terminator (genetics)|terminators]], translational units, [[riboregulator]]s, and composite parts.&lt;ref&gt;Madrigal, Alexis. [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/11/students-engine/ Students Engineer Microbes with “Genetic Legos".] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]].'' 7 Nov. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes devices such as protein generators, [[reporter gene|reporters]], [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverters]], [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], senders, and measurement devices. A key idea that motivated the development of the Registry was to develop an abstraction hierarchy implemented through the parts categorization system.&lt;ref&gt;Endy, D [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7067/full/nature04342.html "Foundations for engineering biology"] ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' 438, 449–453 (24 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The registry has previously received external funding through grants from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]].

The '''''Registry of World Record Size Shells''''' is a [[Conchology|conchological]] work listing the largest (and in some cases smallest) verified [[mollusc shell|shell]] specimens of various marine [[mollusc]]an [[taxon|taxa]]. A successor to the earlier ''World Size Records'' of [[Robert Jacob Lewis Wagner|Robert J. L. Wagner]] and [[R. Tucker Abbott]], it has been published on a semi-regular basis since 1997, changing ownership and publisher a number of times. Originally planned for release every two years, new editions are now published annually. Since 2008 the entire registry has been available online in the form of a searchable [[Online database|database]]. The registry is continuously expanded and now contains more than 24,000 listings and 85,000 supporting images.&lt;ref name=WRS&gt;[http://www.wrs-shells.com/ Registry of World Record Size Shells]. wrs-shells.com. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQ6rzSI--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quiquandon2011&gt;Quiquandon, P.

==Overview==
===Scope===
Throughout its history the registry has covered four [[Class (biology)|classes]] of molluscs: [[bivalve]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[gastropod]]s, and [[scaphopod]]s. [[Chiton]]s have been excluded because their shells are formed from eight articulated plates and therefore the size of a fixed specimen depends in large part on the preservation method used.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;[http://www.wrs-shells.com/wrs_rules_en.php WRS Rules]. wrs-shells.com. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdUIhUwQ--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Smallest adult sizes have been listed beginning with a few specimens of [[Cypraeidae]] and [[Strombidae]] in the first edition,&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; and they now additionally encompass a third family: [[Marginellidae]].&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; Separate records for [[Sinistral and dextral|sinistral]] (left-handed) shells and obviously [[wikt:rostrate|rostrate]] [[Cowry|cowries]] (family [[Cypraeidae]]) are also included.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; [[Terrestrial mollusc|Terrestrial]] and [[Freshwater mollusc|freshwater species]], as well as fossils (of [[extant taxa]] or otherwise), are not covered by the registry.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

[[File:Doopvontschelp grootste ter wereld.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A single valve of ''[[Tridacna gigas]]'', the [[Largest organisms|largest extant bivalve in terms of mass]], and the second-longest species listed in the registry]]
The bulk of the publication—which apart from the cover is unillustrated—comprises a list of taxa and their corresponding world record sizes. Each specimen in the registry is listed alphabetically under its recognised [[scientific name]]. This is usually a [[binomial name|binomen]] (species name), but [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)#Other nomenclature uses|varieties]] and [[Form (zoology)|forms]] are also included (the latter two are used informally and are not regulated by the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]''). In addition to the shell size, each specimen is listed with its location, owner or repository, and the year it was collected, acquired, or registered (whichever is known, listed in decreasing order of preference).&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

Each print edition has an appendix with an alphabetical listing of entry totals for all private collectors and repositories having ownership of specimens in the registry. In the first edition, the most individual entries belonged to Victor Dan, with 369, closely followed by co-author Don Pisor on 325.&lt;ref name=1st /&gt; This title subsequently went to Tennessee physician and world-renowned collector Pete Stimpson, who for a time held over 2,000 entries in the registry,&lt;!--2005 edition--&gt;&lt;ref name=Hursh2012&gt;Hursh, K.

McClung Museum of Natural History &amp; Culture. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OzExaLoW--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of the fifth print edition from 2008, the distinction of having the most WRS entries belonged to Havelet Marine, with 3,244 specimens, compared to Stimpson's 1,963.&lt;ref name=5th&gt;Pisor, D.L. (2008). ''Pisor's Registry of World Record Size Shells''. ConchBooks, Hackenheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurements===
The registry's rules specify that specimens "should be measured with [[vernier calipers|vernier type calipers]] and should reflect the greatest measurable dimension of the shell in any direction including any processes of hard shell material produced by the animal (i.e. [[Sculpture (mollusc)|spines, wings, keels]], [[siphonal canal]]s, etc.) and not including attachments, [[barnacle]]s, [[coralline algae]], or any other encrusting organisms. Long, hair-like [[periostracum]] is not to be included."&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; This "greatest measurable dimension" can be at odds with the standard scientific definition of shell length (from base to apex along the central axis for gastropods, and from the [[Umbo (bivalve)|umbo]] to the ventral margin in bivalves).&lt;ref&gt;Vollero, S. (13 April 2000). [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/50587845 Minutes of the San Diego Shell Club Meeting - March 16, 2000]. ''[[The Festivus]]'' '''32'''(4): 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shell sizes are given in millimetres and recorded to the nearest {{convert|0.1|mm|in}}, as is standard in [[conchology]]. To account for human error and environmental effects, new records are only accepted if they exceed the standing record by at least {{convert|0.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. This 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm margin also applies to smallest adult sizes exceeding {{convert|10.0|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

Entries for specimens that tie the standing record can also be submitted. Though not included in the registry, they are kept on file for future use in the event that the current record holder is shown to be misidentified or smaller than originally claimed.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;

===Size verification===
For inclusion in the registry, size records must be verified either by a recognised second party ("a professional [[malacologist]], a reputable shell dealer, or an advanced collector who is recognized as a specialist in the applicable family") or through photographic evidence (three images, showing the shell being measured with calipers and its [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal and ventral]] aspects).&lt;ref name=Quiquandon2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; Entries may be submitted by regular mail or e-mail; a submission form is included at the back of each print edition. These requirements mean that in some cases older or even current malacological literature may include size records which exceed those found in the registry.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García, E.F. (28 September 2009). [http://www.jaxshells.org/ms19.pdf Book Review: ''Marine Shells of Northeast Florida''.] ''[[The Nautilus (journal)|The Nautilus]]'' '''123'''(3): 220–222. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OzGbjsWL--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the registry, shells were sometimes officially measured for world record size status at [[Conchologists of America]] conventions, as in 1999 when the measurements were carried out by senior author Kim Hutsell.&lt;ref&gt;Scheu, L. (11 March 1999). [http://www.listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9903B&amp;L=conch-l&amp;P=R2036 World Record Size Shells and Measuring].

==History==
===Background===
Beginning in the mid–20th century, several attempts were made to produce a list of the largest shell specimens. Perhaps the earliest of these was the '''''Lost Operculum Club List of Champions''''', initiated in 1950 by [[John Q.

The direct predecessor to the ''Registry of World Record Size Shells'' was '''''World Size Records''''', compiled by renowned [[malacologist]]s [[Robert Jacob Lewis Wagner|Robert J. L. Wagner]] (1905–1992) and [[R. Tucker Abbott]] (1919–1995). These record sizes originally appeared in 1964, in the first edition of ''[[Van Nostrand's Standard Catalog of Shells]]'', not as a separate list but interspersed among other species-specific information that made up the bulk of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, E.H.

''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'' '''40'''(4): 386–387. {{JSTOR|2819371}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated list—now with a section unto itself and running to eight pages—was published as part of the book's second edition, in 1967.&lt;ref name=MK1968&gt;"MK" (1 January 1968).

Unlike previous editions, this third and final installment of the catalog was a [[ring binder]] with loose-leaf content, intended as a continually updated resource. To match the newly retitled work, the list's name was modified to '''''Wagner and Abbott's World Size Records'''''. In this final incarnation, the list appeared as a series of four supplements: the first two were loose-leaf publications that appeared in 1978 and 1982, and these were followed by hole-punched [[paperback]] titles in 1985 and 1990.&lt;ref name=Allen2005&gt;Allen, L.

''World Size Records'' continues. ''American Conchologist'' '''21''': 5.&lt;/ref&gt; no further supplements were completed before Abbott's death in 1995.

===''Registry of World Record Size Shells''===
Following the deaths of Wagner and Abbott, Barbara Haviland continued to compile data for world records. In 1997 Kim C. Hutsell acquired the rights from Cynthia Abbott to ''World Size Records'' to continue the project as a stand-alone book; those rights were subsequently sold to Don L. Pisor. The first edition therefore incorporated many of the earlier entries, as well as additional data compiled for ''World Size Records'' by Haviland.&lt;ref name=1st /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Anonymous] (10 July 1997). [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/49457670 Book news: two new publications announced]. ''[[The Festivus]]'' '''29'''(7): 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The format of the new publication differed from ''World Size Records'' in several important ways. Significantly, the minimum size threshold was lowered from {{convert|2.5|cm|in}} to {{convert|1|cm|in}}. In another change, the registry listed taxa alphabetically by species name within families, instead of within genera as they had been previously.{{refn|group=nb|name=layout|This format would later be dropped for the fourth edition (2005) in favour of alphabetical ordering of species within genera and of genera within families, only to be reinstated for the fifth edition (2008).}} This system allows for easy comparison between closely related genera, is more resilient to the frequent taxonomic changes that occur at the genus level, and gets around the issue that many shell dealers prefer to [[Lumpers and splitters|lump]] numerous genera for the sake of simplicity.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; R. Tucker Abbott had himself intended to use this arrangement in the fifth edition of his ''World Size Records'', but died before he could see his plans through.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; Another difference was the presentation of sizes in millimetres to the nearest tenth instead of centimetres to the nearest hundredth, moving the publication in line with standard usage in conchology. Finally, references were added for each specimen to aid in identification. The opening paragraph of the first edition set out the project's goals and invited submissions:&lt;ref name=1st /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the importance of maximum shell size and its role in the overall scheme of Conchology and Malacology is debatable, it remains one point of continual interest among collectors and researchers. The purpose of the Registry of World Record Size Shells is to provide a single publication containing a list of the largest known specimens for as many shelled molluscan species as possible in a format designed for ease of use. Undoubtedly, specimens may exist, hidden in museums, universities and private collections, which exceed some of the sizes listed herein. It is the sincere hope of the editors that information concerning such specimens be shared with others by submitting accurate and verifiable records to the Registry of World Record Size Shells.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The largest shell specimens are often housed in museums, but such institutions can rarely commit significant resources towards mensuration, and most records pertaining to museum specimens were collated by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Hutsell, K.C. (8 October 1998). [http://www.listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9810B&amp;L=conch-l&amp;P=R419 Re: P. rumphii World Record]. CONCH-L archives. &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQ2kqFD--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim C. Hutsell, Linda L. Hutsell and Don L. Pisor released the first three editions in 1997, 1999, and 2001. These were published by the Hutsells' company, Snail's Pace Productions, and distributed by Pisor's Marine Shells, both based in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. The first edition went on sale at the 1997 [[Conchologists of America]] (COA) convention in [[Captiva Island]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; Originally called '''''Hutsell &amp; Pisor's Registry of World Record Size Shells''''', for the third edition the title was modified slightly to '''''Hutsell, Hutsell and Pisor's Registry of World Record Size Shells''''' (as given on the respective [[title page]]s).

The text of the fourth edition was completed by Kim and Linda Hutsell and originally planned for release at the 2003 COA convention in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref name=Allen2005 /&gt; but was greatly delayed and only came out in 2005. The fifth edition appeared three years later. With the departure of the first two authors, the titles of the fourth and fifth editions were shortened to '''''Pisor's Registry of World Record Size Shells''''' (as given on the title pages). These also marked a switch from Snail's Pace Productions to a new main publisher, ConchBooks of [[Hackenheim]], [[Germany]].{{refn|group=nb|name=publishers|The fourth edition (2005) is identified on its front cover as "A Publication of Snail's Pace Productions and ConchBooks". Its [[title page]] gives Pisor as the author, Conchology, Inc. as the compiler, and ConchBooks as the editor. The fifth edition (2008) has "A Publication of ConchBooks and Pisor Marine Enterprise, Inc." on the cover, with the title page listing Pisor as the author, Conchology, Inc. as the compiler, both ConchBooks and Pisor Marine Enterprise as the editors, and crediting Guido T. Poppe for reworking the book.}} They were compiled with the help of Conchology, Inc., with the company's founder, [[Guido T. Poppe]], providing an introduction for the fifth edition.

On 2 April 2008, the copyrights to the registry were transferred from Pisor to Jean-Pierre Barbier of Topseashells and Philippe Quiquandon of Shell's Passion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topseashells.com/wrs.php Transfer of World Record Size Shells Registry].

===First edition===
[[File:Bayerotrochus midas 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The first edition of the registry gave the WRS of ''[[Bayerotrochus midas]]'' (pictured; listed under its [[basionym]] ''Perotrochus midas'') as 77.4&amp;nbsp;mm, when the [[type specimen]] itself was considerably larger at 118.3&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;]]
The first edition of the ''Registry of World Record Size Shells'' was reviewed for ''[[American Conchologist]]'' by [[malacologist]] [[Gary Rosenberg]] of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] and [[conchologist]] [[Gene Everson]].&lt;ref name=COA&gt;Rosenberg, G. &amp; G. Everson (September 1997). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267327631_Book_Review_Registry_of_World_Record_Size_Shells_by_Kim_C_Hutsell_Linda_L_Hutsell_and_Donald_L_Pisor Book Review: ''Registry of World Record Size Shells'' by Kim C. Hutsell, Linda L. Hutsell and Donald L. Pisor]. ''American Conchologist'' '''25'''(3): 18–19. &lt;!--https://web.archive.org/web/20060212213334/http://www.conchologistsofamerica.org/articles/reviews/9709.asp https://www.webcitation.org/6OdQtKMo7--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg spoke favourably of the changes made since ''World Size Records'', namely the lowering of the minimum size for inclusion, listing sizes in millimetres, ordering species alphabetically within families irrespective of genus, and adding a reference field for identification purposes. He also welcomed the inclusion of separate entries for [[infraspecific taxa]] such as [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)#Other nomenclature uses|varieties]], and [[Form (zoology)|forms]], noting that these "might someday prove to be full species, and maximum sizes might provide evidence as to their status".&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Rosenberg identified a minor inconsistency in the grouping of [[cephalopod]]s ([[Argonautidae]] and [[Nautilidae]]) and [[scaphopod]]s ([[Dentaliidae]]) with [[gastropod]]s while listing [[bivalve]]s separately, opining that "a single alphabetic sequence would be preferable".&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; Rosenberg also found "an unusual number of typographical errors", which he attributed to a rush to have the work ready for the 1997 COA convention. Other issues identified by Rosenberg included the listing of [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] (e.g. ''[[Oliva sericea]]'' and its junior synonym ''[[Oliva textilina]]'') and [[Basionym|different combinations]] of the same species (e.g. ''[[Ancilla lienardi]]'' and ''[[Eburna lienardi]]''). While suggesting that errors of the second type would be easier to catch if [[Author citation (zoology)|author citations]] were included, Rosenberg conceded that this might not be practical due to space limitations. Rosenberg also noted entries where the cited location fell well outside the species's natural range (e.g. a supposed West African specimen of the East African ''[[Ancilla ventricosa]]'').&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Comparing around a quarter of the size records from the first edition against shells in the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Rosenberg found that the latter had larger specimens in some 10% of cases.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt; What Rosenberg considered "[o]f greatest concern", however, were discrepancies between the record sizes listed in the registry and larger specimens found in contemporary monographic works, and this even extended to [[type specimen]]s in some cases.{{refn|group=nb|name=smaller|The first edition listed the world record size for ''[[Perotrochus midas]]'' as 77.4&amp;nbsp;mm, but the 118.3&amp;nbsp;mm [[holotype]] and an even larger 127.5&amp;nbsp;mm specimen had both been cited in the comprehensive monograph of Anseeuw &amp; Goto (1996).&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;}} The problem seemed to be particularly pronounced in the [[Pleurotomariidae]]—a family highly prized by shell collectors—where nine out of sixteen species had larger shells listed in the standard work on the family, that of Anseeuw &amp; Goto (1996). Similar issues were found with the record sizes of [[Terebridae]].{{refn|group=nb|name=smaller2|An extreme example was ''[[Terebra funiculata]]'', with the registry listing a 32.5&amp;nbsp;mm record as compared to the 69&amp;nbsp;mm maximum given in Bratcher &amp; Cernohorsky (1987).&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;}} Rosenberg concluded: "The Registry would be much more authoritative if it included record sizes from the literature, and I recommend this be done in future editions."&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Gene Everson echoed Rosenberg in highlighting the changes from ''World Size Records'' as major improvements. In particular he praised the format and exhaustiveness of the publication, writing that, despite having almost double the entries of its predecessor, the registry was much easier to handle compared with the "heavy and bulky" ''Standard Catalog of Shells''. He added that the authors' choice of [[coil binding]] made it easier to keep the registry open at the desired page.&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

Everson questioned some of the publication choices for the reference field, such as the conspicuous omission of "the definitive work on New Zealand shells", ''[[New Zealand Mollusca]]'' by [[Arthur William Baden Powell]]. He continued: "Many other landmark works by highly respected malacologists are omitted, while articles in periodicals frequently written by amateurs, such as ''[[La Conchliglia]]'' and ''[[American Conchologist]]'', are [not]. It would seem the included 49 references were just those used by the authors for this edition." He suggested that future editions should clearly set out what types of references are acceptable. Summarising, Everson wrote:&lt;ref name=COA /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is meant to be a useful, working and evolving tool and should not be nitpicked on details that are not relevant to its purpose. The authors are not producing a treatise on each family with hot-off-the-press reclassifications. I suspect they are following [[Kay Cunningham Vaught|Vaught]]'s classification which has been out for a few years, and is by no means perfect or up-to-date, but is readily available and inexpensive, and thus a good choice. But if so, this standard should be identified in the introduction, so that one knows where to find a shell. Also, typos are found in almost every book, and this is no exception, but they do not lessen the useful information, which is the main reason why we will buy this book. Two thumbs up!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later editions===
A review of the 11th edition criticised the lack of [[pagination]] and, consequently, of an index, as well as the lack of page headings indicating families.&lt;ref name=mdm&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6OdKD4oFH Registry of World Record Size Shells - 2014].

I. |last2=Li |first2=W. H. |title=Evidence for higher rates of nucleotide substitution in rodents than in man |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1 March 1985 |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=1741–1745 |doi=10.1073/pnas.82.6.1741 |pmid=3856856 |pmc=397348 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; If more change has occurred on one lineage relative to another lineage since their shared common ancestor, then the outgroup species will be more different from the ''faster''-evolving lineage's species than it is from the ''slower''-evolving lineage's species. This is because the faster-evolving lineage will, by definition, have accumulated more differences since the common ancestor than the slower-evolving lineage. This method can be applied to averaged data (i.e., groups of molecules), or individual molecules. It is possible for individual molecules to show evidence of approximately constant rates of change in different lineages even while the rates differ between different molecules. The relative rate test is a direct internal test of the molecular clock, for a given molecule and a given set of species, and shows that the molecular clock does not need to be (and should never be) assumed: It can be directly assessed from the data itself. Note that the logic can also be applied to any kind of data for which a distance measure can be defined (e.g., even morphological features).

== Uses ==

The initial use of this method was to assess whether or not there was evidence for different rates of molecular change in different lineages for particular molecules. If there was no evidence of significantly different rates, this would be direct evidence of a [[molecular clock]], and (only) then would allow for a phylogeny to be constructed based on relative branch points (absolute dates for branch points in the phylogeny would require further calibration with the best-attested fossil evidence). [[Vincent Sarich|Sarich]] and [[Allan Wilson (biologist)|Wilson]] used the method to show that approximately the same amount of change had occurred in albumin in both the human (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') and chimpanzee (''[[Pan troglodytes]]'') lineages since their common ancestor. This was done by showing that both human and chimpanzee albumin were equally different from, e.g., monkey albumin. They found the same pattern for other Primate species (i.e., equidistant from an outgroup comparison), which allowed them to then create a relative [[Phylogeny|phylogenetic tree]] (hypothesis of evolutionary branching order) of Primates. When calibrated with well-attested fossil evidence (for example, no Primates of modern aspect before the K-T boundary), this led them to argue that the human-chimp split had occurred only ~5 million years ago (which was much younger than previously supposed by paleontologists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarich |first1=V. M. |last2=Wilson |first2=A. C. |title=Immunological Time Scale for Hominid Evolution |journal=Science |date=1 December 1967 |volume=158 |issue=3805 |pages=1200–1203 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3805.1200 |pmid=4964406 |s2cid=7349579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other important uses for the relative rate test are to determine if and how [[generation time]] and metabolic processes affect mutational rate. Firstly is generation time. Sarich and Wilson first used the relative rate test to show that there was no evidence of a generation effect on lineage mutation rates for [[albumin]] within primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarich |first1=V. M. |last2=Wilson |first2=A. C. |title=Generation Time and Genomic Evolution in Primates |journal=Science |date=16 March 1973 |volume=179 |issue=4078 |pages=1144–1147 |doi=10.1126/science.179.4078.1144 |pmid=4120260 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using 4 carnivore species as outgroups, they showed that humans (with much longer generation times) had not accumulated significantly fewer (or greater) molecular changes than had other primates in their sample (e.g., [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], [[spider monkey]]s, and various [[prosimian]]s all of which have much shorter generation times). However, a famous experiment comparing eleven genes between mice or rats to humans, with pig, cow, goat, dog, and rabbits acting as an outgroup reference, suggested that rodents ''had'' faster mutation rates. Rodents have a much shorter generation time than humans, and so it was suggested that they would be expected to have much faster mutation rates, and so evolve faster. This theory was supported through testing [[coding regions]] and [[untranslated regions]] with the relative rate test (which showed that rodents had a mutation rate much higher than humans) and backed up by comparing [[paralogous]] genes because they are homologous via gene duplication and not speciation and so the comparison is independent of the time of divergence.&lt;ref name="pnas" /&gt;

The other use of the test is to determine the effect of metabolic processes. It had previously been believed that birds have a much slower [[molecular evolution]]ary rate than other animals, such as mammals, but that was based solely on the small genetic differences between birds, which relied on the fossil record. This was later confirmed with the relative rate test, however the theory was that this was because of metabolic rate and a lower body temperature in birds. Mindell’s paper explains that there was no direct correlation found between these and molecular evolution in the test taxa of birds based on mitochondrial evolution, but birds as a whole do have a lower mutation rate. There are still many hypotheses in this area of study that are being tested, but the relative rate test is proving crucial in order to overcome the fossil record bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mindel |first1=D. P. |last2=Knight |first2=A. |last3=Baer |first3=C. |last4=Huddleston |first4=C. J. |title=Slow Rates of Molecular Evolution in Birds and the Metabolic Rate and Body Temperature Hypotheses |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=1 February 1996 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=422–426 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025601 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these are specific instances of the relative rate test, it may also be used to compare species for phylogenetic purposes. For example, Easteal wanted to compare nucleotide substitution rates in four genes of four [[eutherian]] mammals. He did this via the relative rate test and then, using this data, he was able to construct a [[phylogeny]] using various methods, including [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] and maximum likelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Easteal |first1=S. |title=The Pattern of Mammalian Evolution and the Relative Rate of Molecular Evolution |journal=Genetics |date=January 1990 |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=165–173 |doi=10.1093/genetics/124.1.165 |pmid=2307352 |pmc=1203903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the same approach in another experiment to compare humans to other primates, and found no significant difference in evolutionary rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Easteal |first1=S. |title=The relative rate of DNA evolution in primates. |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=1 January 1991 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=115–127 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040632 |pmid=2002761 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pros and Cons ==

It is generally agreed that the relative rate test has many strengths that make it invaluable for experimenters. For example, using this test, the date of divergence between two species is not needed.&lt;ref name="pnas" /&gt; Also, a generalized test minimizes sampling bias&lt;ref name="Robinson et al 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=M. |last2=Gouy |first2=M. |last3=Gautier |first3=C. |last4=Mouchiroud |first4=D. |title=Sensitivity of the relative-rate test to taxonomic sampling. |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=1 September 1998 |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=1091–1098 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026016 |pmid=9729873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bias of the fossil record.
However, the relative rate test is very poor in some areas, such as detecting major differences compared to rate constancy if it is being used as a test for the [[molecular clock]].&lt;ref name="Bromham et al 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bromham |first1=Lindell |title=Molecular Clocks in Reptiles: Life History Influences Rate of Molecular Evolution |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=1 March 2002 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=302–309 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004083 |pmid=11861889 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson claims that for this test, size does matter. The relative rate test may have a problem picking up significant variations if the tested sequences are less than one thousand [[nucleotides]]. This may be because variations are within the expected error of the test, and because there are so few nucleotides to compare, there is no way to be absolutely sure.&lt;ref name="Robinson et al 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromham et al 2002" /&gt;
So, the relative rate test is strong by itself, but it is usually not the only basis for a conclusion. It tends to be paired with other tests, such as [[branch length test|branch length]] or [[two-cluster test]]s in order to make sure conclusions are accurate and not based on faulty results.

A '''relict''' is a surviving remnant of a natural phenomenon.

==Biology==
{{main|Relict (biology)}}
A relict (or relic) is an organism that at an earlier time was abundant in a large area but now occurs at only one or a few small areas.

==Geology and geomorphology==
{{main|Relict (geology)}}
In [[geology]], a relict is a structure or mineral from a parent rock that did not undergo metamorphosis when the surrounding rock did, or a rock that survived a destructive geologic process.

In [[geomorphology]], a relict landform is a [[landform]] formed by either erosive or constructive surficial processes that are no longer active as they were in the past.

A [[glacial relict]] is a cold-adapted organism that is a remnant of a larger distribution that existed in the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]]. 

==Human populations==
As revealed by [[DNA test]]ing, a relict population is an ancient people in an area, who have been largely supplanted by a later group of migrants and their descendants. 

In various places around the world, minority [[ethnic group]]s represent lineages of ancient [[human migration]]s in places now occupied by more populous ethnic groups, whose ancestors arrived later. For example, the first human groups to inhabit the Caribbean islands were [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes from South and Central America. Genetic testing of natives of Cuba show that, in late pre-Columbian times, the island was home to agriculturalists of [[Taíno people|Taino]] ethnicity. In addition, a relict population of the original hunter-gatherers remained in western Cuba as the [[Ciboney people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Rensch's rule''' is a [[biological rules |biological rule]] on [[allometric law |allometrics]], concerning the relationship between the extent of [[sexual size dimorphism]] and which sex is larger. Across species within a [[Lineage (evolution) |lineage]], size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. The rule was proposed by the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Bernhard Rensch]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Rensch, B. (1950). Die Abhängigkeit der relativen Sexualdifferenz von der Körpergrösse. Bonner Zoologische Beiträge 1:58-69.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After controlling for [[confounding]] factors such as evolutionary history, an increase in average body size makes the difference in body size larger if the species has larger males, and smaller if it has larger females.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dale |first1=James |last2=Dunn |first2=Peter O. |last3=Figuerola |first3=Jordi |last4=Lislevand |first4=Terje |last5=Székely |first5=Tamás |last6=Whittingham |first6=Linda A. |date=2007-12-07 |title=Sexual selection explains Rensch's rule of allometry for sexual size dimorphism |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |language=en |volume=274 |issue=1628 |pages=2971–2979 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1043 |issn=0962-8452 |pmid=17878139 |pmc=2211517}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies propose that this is due to [[sexual bimaturism]], which causes male traits to diverge faster and develop for a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/18558/ |title=Proximate Causes of Rensch's Rule: Does Sexual Size Dimorphism in Arthropods Result from Differences in Development Time? |last1=Blanckenhorn |first1=Wolf |last2=Dixon |first2=A |journal=The American Naturalist |year=2007 |volume=169 |issue=2 |pages=245–257 |publisher=University of Zurich |doi=10.1086/510597 |pmid=17211807 |s2cid=19831154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between sexual size dimorphism and body size is hypothesized to be a result of an increase in male-male competition in larger species,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Székely |first1=Tamás |last2=Freckleton |first2=Robert P. |last3=Reynolds |first3=John D. |date=2004-08-17 |title=Sexual selection explains Rensch's rule of size dimorphism in shorebirds |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |language=en |volume=101 |issue=33 |pages=12224–12227 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404503101 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=15304645 |pmc=514460|bibcode=2004PNAS..10112224S |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; a result of limited environmental resources, fuelling aggression between males over access to breeding territories&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lengkeek |first1=W. |last2=Didderen |first2=K. |last3=Côté |first3=I.

In the [[biological sciences]], a '''replicate''' is an exact copy of a sample that is being analyzed, such as a cell, organism or molecule, on which exactly the same procedure is done. This is often done in order to check for [[experimental error|experimental]] or procedural error. In the absence of error replicates should yield the same result. However, replicates are not independent tests of the hypothesis because they are still the same sample, and so do not test for variation between samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vaux, D.|author2=Fidler, F.|author3=Cumming, G.|name-list-style=amp|title=Replicates and repeats—what is the difference and is it significant?|journal=EMBO Rep|volume=13|issue=4|pages=291–296|year=2012|pmc=3321166|doi=10.1038/embor.2012.36|pmid=22421999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Replicate|title=Replicate - Biology-Online Dictionary|work=biology-online.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicates are often created to test the quality and repeatability of a procedure, or for a destructive procedure where preserving the original sample is desirable. They are also sometimes inappropriately used to inflate the apparent number of observations in a sample, creating an illusion of [[statistical significance]].

'''Representative sequences''' are short regions within [[Protein primary structure|protein sequences]] that can be used to approximate the [[Molecular evolution|evolutionary relationships]] of those proteins, or the organisms from which they come. Representative sequences are contiguous subsequences (typically 300 [[amino acid |residues]]) from [[Housekeeping gene|ubiquitous]], conserved proteins, such that each [[orthologous]] family of representative sequences taken alone gives a [[Distance matrices in phylogeny|distance matrix]] in close agreement with the consensus matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bern|first1= Marshall|last2= Goldberg|first2= David|date= November 2, 2004|title= Automatic selection of representative proteins for bacterial phylogeny|journal= BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume= 5|issue= 34|pages= 34|doi= 10.1186/1471-2148-5-34|pmid= 15927057|pmc= 1175084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
[[Protein sequence]]s can provide data about the [[Function (biology)|biological function]] and [[evolution]] of proteins and [[protein domain]]s. Grouping and interrelating protein sequences can therefore provide information about both human biological processes, and the evolutionary development of biological processes on earth; such [[sequence cluster]]s allow for the effective coverage of sequence space. Sequence clusters can reduce a large database of sequences to a smaller set of ''sequence representatives'', each of which should represent its cluster at the sequence level. Sequence representatives allow the effective coverage of the original database with fewer sequences. The database of sequence representatives is called ''non-redundant'', as similar (or redundant) sequences have been removed at a certain similarity threshold.

'''Reproductive interference''' is the interaction between individuals of different [[species]] during mate acquisition that leads to a reduction of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in one or more of the individuals involved. The interactions occur when individuals make mistakes or are unable to recognise their own species, labelled as ‘incomplete [[Intra-species recognition|species recognition]]'. Reproductive interference has been found within a variety of taxa, including [[insect]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[Marine life|marine organisms]], and [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gröning J, Hochkirch A | title = Reproductive interference between animal species | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–82 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18792662 | doi = 10.1086/590510 | s2cid = 10782873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven causes of reproductive interference, namely signal jamming, heterospecific [[rivalry]], misdirected [[courtship]], heterospecific mating attempts, erroneous [[Mate choice|female choice]], heterospecific mating, and [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridisation]]. All types have fitness costs on the participating individuals, generally from a reduction in reproductive success, a waste of [[gamete]]s, and the expenditure of energy and [[nutrient]]s. These costs are variable and dependent on numerous factors, such as the cause of reproductive interference, the sex of the parent, and the species involved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reproductive interference occurs between species that occupy the same habitat and can play a role in influencing the coexistence of these species. It differs from [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as reproductive interference does not occur due to a shared [[resource]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Reproductive interference can have ecological consequences, such as through the segregation of species both spatially and temporally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuno|first=Eizi|date=1992|title=Competitive exclusion through reproductive interference|journal=Researches on Population Ecology|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=275–284|doi=10.1007/BF02514797|s2cid=455098|issn=1437-5613}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also have evolutionary consequences, for example; it can impose a [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] on the effected species to evolve traits that better distinguish themselves from other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cothran|first=Rickey D.|date=2015|title=The importance of reproductive interference in ecology and evolution: from organisms to communities|journal=Population Ecology|language=en|volume=57|issue=2|pages=339–341|doi=10.1007/s10144-015-0488-z|s2cid=16824596|issn=1438-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of reproductive interference ==
Reproductive interference can occur at different stages of mating, from locating a potential mate, to the fertilisation of an individual of a different species. There are seven causes of reproductive interference that each have their own consequences on the fitness of one or both of the involved individuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Signal jamming ===
Signal jamming refers to the interference of one signal by another.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jamming can occur by signals emitted from environmental sources (e.g. noise pollution), or from other species. In the context of reproductive interference, signal jamming only refers to the disruption of the transmission or retrieval of signals by another species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The process of mate attraction and acquisition involves signals to aid in locating and recognising potential mates. Signals can also give the receiver an indication of the quality of a potential mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rendall|first1=Drew|last2=Owren|first2=Michael J.|last3=Ryan|first3=Michael J.|date=2009|title=What do animal signals mean?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347209002589|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=233–240|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.06.007|s2cid=10163901|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signal jamming can occur in different types of communication. Auditory signal jamming, otherwise labelled as auditory masking, is when a noisy environment created by heterospecific signals causes difficulties in identifying conspecifics.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Carl H.|last2=Enret|first2=Günter|date=2009|title=Auditory masking and effects of noise on responses of the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea) to synthetic mating calls|url=https://oparu.uni-ulm.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1218/vts_6713_9234.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|volume=141|pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in chemical signals, pheromones that are meant to attract conspecifics and drive off others may overlap with heterospecific pheromones, leading to confusion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Saveer|first1=Ahmed M.|last2=Becher|first2=Paul G.|last3=Birgersson|first3=Göran|last4=Hansson|first4=Bill S.|last5=Witzgall|first5=Peter|last6=Bengtsson|first6=Marie|date=2014|title=Mate recognition and reproductive isolation in the sibling species Spodoptera littoralis and Spodoptera litura|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fevo.2014.00018|issn=2296-701X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in recognising and locating conspecifics can result in a reduction of encounters with potential mates and a decrease in mating frequencies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[File:Scaphoideus titanus mating.jpg|thumb|Pair of mating American grapevine leafhoppers (''Scaphoideus titanus'')]]
Vibrational signalling in the [[Scaphoideus titanus|American grapevine leafhopper]] - Individuals of the American grapevine leafhopper communicate with each other through vibrational signals that they transmit through the host plant. American grapevine leafhoppers are receptive of signals within their receptor’s sensitivity range of 50 to 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The vibrations can be used to identify and locate potential female mates. To successfully communicate, a duet is performed between the male and female American grapevine leafhopper. The female replies within a specific timeframe after the male signal, and the male may use the timing of her reply to identify her. However, vibrational signals are prone to disruption and masking by heterospecific signals, conspecific signals, and background noise that are within their species-specific sensitivity range. The interference of the duet between a male and female American grapevine leafhopper can reduce the male’s success in identifying and locating the female, which can reduce the frequency of mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mazzoni|first1=Valerio|last2=Lucchi|first2=Andrea|last3=Čokl|first3=Andrej|last4=Prešern|first4=Janez|last5=Virant‐Doberlet|first5=Meta|date=2009|title=Disruption of the reproductive behaviour of Scaphoideus titanus by playback of vibrational signals|journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata|language=en|volume=133|issue=2|pages=174–185|doi=10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00911.x|s2cid=85149853|issn=1570-7458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hyla versicolor.jpg|thumb|Gray treefrog (''Hyla versicolor'')]]
Auditory signalling in the [[gray treefrog]] (''Hyla versicolor'') and the [[Cope's gray tree frog|Cope's gray treefrogs]] (''Hyla chrysoscelis'') – The success of reproduction is dependent on a female’s ability to correctly identify and respond to the advertisement call of a potential mate. At a breeding site with high densities of males, the male’s chorus may overlap with heterospecific calls, making it difficult for the female to successfully locate a mate. When the advertisement calls of the male gray treefrog and male Cope’s gray treefrog overlap, female gray treefrogs make mistakes and choose the heterospecific call. The amount of errors the female makes is dependent on the amount of overlap between signals. Female Cope’s gray treefrogs can better differentiate the signals and are only significantly affected when heterospecifics completely overlap conspecific male signals. However, female Cope’s gray treefrogs prefer conspecific male signals that have less overlap (i.e. less interference). Furthermore, females have longer response times to overlapped calls, where it takes longer for them to choose a mate. Signal jamming can affect both males and females as difficulties in identifying and locating a mate reduces their mating frequencies. Females may have more costs if they mate with a male of a lower quality, and may be susceptible to a higher risk of predation by predators within the breeding site if they take longer to choose and locate a male. Heterospecific mating between the gray treefrog and Cope’s gray treefrogs also can form an infertile hybrid which is highly costly to both parents due to the wastage of gametes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Vincent T.|last2=Schwartz|first2=Joshua J.|last3=Gerhardt|first3=H. Carl|date=2006-08-01|title=Effects of heterospecific call overlap on the phonotactic behaviour of grey treefrogs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347206001801|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=72|issue=2|pages=449–459|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.02.001|s2cid=53144275|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical signalling in [[tick]]s – Female ticks produce a pheromone that is a species-specific signal to attract conspecific males that are attached to the host. Female ticks also produce a pheromone that is not species-specific which can attract males that are in a close proximity to her. Pheromones emitted from closely related species can mix and lead to interference. Three species of ticks: ''Aponomma hydrosauri'', ''Amblyomma albolimbatum'', and ''Amblyomma limbatum'', are closely related and can interfere with one another when attached to the same host. When two of the species of tick are attached on the same host, males have difficulties locating a female of the same species, potentially due to the mixing of pheromones. The pheromone that is not species-specific also has the capability of attracting males of all three species when they are in close proximity to the female. The presence of a heterospecific female can also reduce the time a male spends with conspecific females, leading to a reduction of reproductive success. Furthermore, when ''Amblyomma albolimbatum'' males attach to ''Aponomma hydrosauri'' females to mate, despite being unsuccessful, they remain attached which physically inhibits following males from mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrews RH, Petney TN, Bull CM | title = Reproductive interference between three parapatric species of reptile tick | journal = Oecologia | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 281–286 | date = February 1982 | pmid = 28310522 | doi = 10.1007/BF00363851 | bibcode = 1982Oecol..52..281A | s2cid = 6123730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heterospecific rivalry ===
Heterospecific rivalry occurs between males, when a male of a different species is mistaken as a rival for mates (i.e. mistaken for a conspecific male).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In particular, heterospecific rivalry is hard to differentiate from other interspecific interactions, such as the competition over food and other resources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Costs to the mistaken males can include the wastage of time and energy, and a higher risk of injury and predation if they leave their mating territory to pursue the heterospecific male.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Fred|date=1990-01-01|title=Reproductive Costs Arising From Incomplete Habitat Segregation Among Three Species of Leucorrhinia Dragonflies|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/115/3-4/article-p188_4.xml|journal=Behaviour|language=en|volume=115|issue=3–4|pages=188–201|doi=10.1163/156853990X00572|issn=0005-7959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males that chase off a heterospecific male may also leave females exposed to following intruders, whether it be a conspecific or heterospecific male.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Eastern amberwing [[dragonfly]] (''[[Eastern amberwing|Perithemis tenera]]'') – Male Eastern amberwing dragonflies are territorial as they defend mating territories from rival conspecific males. The male will perch around their territory and pursue conspecifics that fly near the perch. When the male is approached by a species of [[Horse-fly|horsefly]] and [[butterfly]], they are similarly pursued. The horsefly and butterfly do not compete over a common resource with the Eastern amberwing dragonfly, have not been seen interfering with the mating within the territory, and are neither a predator nor prey of the Eastern amberwing dragonfly. Instead, they are pursued potentially due to being mistaken for a rival conspecific as they share similar characteristics in size, colour, and flight height. The similar characteristics may be cues used by the male Eastern amberwing dragonfly to identify conspecifics. The heterospecific pursuit is costly for the male as they waste energy and time, have a higher risk of injury, and may lose opportunities to defend their territory against subsequent intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Jaime K.|last2=Switzer|first2=Paul V.|date=2001-09-01|title=Pursuit of Heterospecific Targets by Territorial Amberwing Dragonflies (Perithemis tenera Say): A Case of Mistaken Identity|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=607–620|doi=10.1023/A:1012223217250|s2cid=14266312|issn=1572-8889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misdirected courtship ===
Misdirected courtship occurs when males display courtship towards individuals of a different species of either sex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The misdirection is caused by a mistake during species recognition, or by an attraction towards heterospecifics that possess desirable traits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such desirable traits are those traits that normally are an indicator of conspecific mate quality, such as body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Costa-Schmidt|first1=L.

[[Uraeginthus|Waxbill]] – Waxbills are [[Monogamy|monogamous]], where an individual only has one partner. Parents also display [[Parenting|biparental care]], where both the mother and father contribute to the care of the offspring. The combination of monogamy and [[parental investment|biparental investment]] suggest that both male and female waxbills should be ‘choosy’ and have strong preferences to reduce the chances of mating with a heterospecific female. Males of the three species of waxbill: [[Blue waxbill|blue breast]] (''Uraeginthus angolensis''), [[Red-cheeked cordon-bleu|red cheek]] (''Uraeginthus bengalus'')'','' and [[Blue-capped cordon-bleu|blue cap]] (''Uraeginthus cyanocephalus''), have differing strengths of preferences for conspecific females when also presented with a heterospecific female. The differing preferences is affected by the body size of the females, potentially due to body size being an indicator of [[fecundity]], which is the ability to produce offspring. Blue breast males prefer conspecifics over red cheek females that are smaller; however, have a weaker preference for conspecifics over blue breast females that are only slightly smaller. Red cheek males have no preference for conspecifics in the presence of a larger blue breast female or blue cap female. Blue cap males prefer conspecifics over red cheek females; however, have no preference for conspecifics in the presence of a larger blue breast male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brooks|last2=Luddem|last3=Collins|last4=Winter|date=2004|title=Some Males are Choosier Than Others: Species Recognition in Blue Waxbills|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/141/8/article-p1021_5.xml|journal=Behaviour|language=en|volume=141|issue=8|pages=1021–1039|doi=10.1163/1568539042360170|issn=0005-7959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Atlantic salmon parr.jpg|thumb|Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'')]]
[[Atlantic salmon]] (''Salmo salar'') – Atlantic salmon that were once native to [[Lake Ontario]] were reintroduced to the lake to study their [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] interactions with other species of fish, including the [[chinook salmon]], [[coho salmon]], and [[brown trout]]. Chinook salmon interacted with Atlantic salmon the most, where male chinooks attempted to court female Atlantic salmon. Male chinooks also chased away, and in some interactions, behaved aggressively towards other Atlantic salmon that approached female Atlantic salmon. A male brown trout was also observed to court a female Atlantic salmon. Misdirected courtship towards the Atlantic salmon can cause problems in waters that the Atlantic salmon currently occupy, and towards conservation efforts to reintroduce the Atlantic salmon to Lake Ontario. Implications of misdirected courtship on the Atlantic salmon can cause the delay or prevention of spawning, and the hybridisation of the Atlantic salmon with other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=R.

=== Heterospecific mating attempts ===
Heterospecific mating attempts occur when males attempt to mate with females of a different species, regardless of whether courtship occurs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During each mating attempt, sperm transfer may or may not occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both sexes have costs when a heterospecific attempts to mate.

[[Tetrix ceperoi|Cepero's grasshopper]] (''Tetrix ceperoi'') and the [[Tetrix subulata|slender groundhopper]] (''Tetrix subulata'') – Naturally the distribution of the Cepero’s grasshopper and slender groundhopper overlap; however, they rarely co-exist. The reproductive success of the Cepero’s grasshopper decreases when housed within the same enclosure as high numbers of the slender groundhopper. The reduction of reproductive success stems from an increase in mating attempts by the Cepero's grasshopper towards the slender groundhopper, which may be due to their larger body size. However, these mating attempts are generally unsuccessful as the mate recognition of female slender groundhoppers are reliable, which may be due to the different courtship displays of the two species. The reduced reproductive success can cause the displacement in one of the species, potentially a factor as to why the species rarely co-exist despite sharing similar habitat preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hochkirch A, Gröning J, Bücker A | title = Sympatry with the devil: reproductive interference could hamper species coexistence | journal = The Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 633–42 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17584368 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01241.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Agile frog (Rana dalmatina) Female closeup.jpg|thumb|Agile frog (''Rana dalmatina'')]]
[[Italian agile frog]] (''Rana latastei'') - The distribution of Italian agile frog and the [[agile frog]] (''Rana dalmatina'') overlap naturally in ponds and drainage ditches. In the areas of overlap, the abundance of agile frogs is higher than Italian agile frogs. When there is a higher abundance of agile frogs, the mating between Italian agile frogs is interfered with. Male agile frogs attempt to displace male Italian agile frogs during [[amplexus]], which is a type of mating position where the male grasps onto the female. The Italian agile frog and agile frog have been seen in amplexus when co-existing. The mating attempts by the agile frog reduces the reproductive success of the Italian agile frog. The Italian agile frog also produces a lower number of viable eggs in the presence of the agile frog, potentially due to sperm competition between the male Italian agile frog and agile frog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hettyey|first1=Attila|last2=Pearman|first2=Peter B.|date=2003-03-01|title=Social environment and reproductive interference affect reproductive success in the frog Rana latastei|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/14/2/294/192742|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=294–300|doi=10.1093/beheco/14.2.294|issn=1045-2249|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Erroneous female choice ===
Erroneous female choice refers to mistakes made by females when differentiating males of the same species from males of a different species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female choice may occur at different stages of mating, including male courtship, [[copulation]], or after copulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wong BB, Candolin U|date=November 2005|title=How is female mate choice affected by male competition?|journal=Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=80|issue=4|pages=559–71|doi=10.1017/S1464793105006809|pmid=16221329|hdl=1912/256|s2cid=34887859|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female choice can depend on the availability of appropriate males.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wirtz P|date=July 1999|title=Mother species-father species: unidirectional hybridization in animals with female choice|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347299911442|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=58|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1144|pmid=10413535|s2cid=21325030}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there are less available conspecific males, females may make more mistakes as they become less ‘choosy’.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Striped ground cricket (''[[Allonemobius fasciatus]]'') and Southern ground cricket (''[[Allonemobius socius]]'') - The striped ground cricket and the Southern ground cricket are closely related species that have an overlapping distribution. Both crickets use calling songs in order to identify and locate potential mates. The songs of the two species have a different frequency and period. Females of both species show little preference between the songs from conspecific and heterospecific males. The minor preference disappears if the intensity of the calls are altered. The lack of ability to differentiate between the two songs can result in erroneous female choice. Erroneous female choice has costs, including energy wastage, and increases in predation risk when searching for a conspecific. Additionally, it is highly costly when the mistake leads to heterospecific mating, which involves the wastage of gametes. However, the cost of erroneous female choice may be small for the striped ground and Southern ground cricket due to their high abundance. The lack of ability to differentiate between the calling songs is proposed to be due to the weak selective pressure on the females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Doherty|first1=JOHN A.|last2=Howard|first2=DANIEL J.|date=1996-05-01|title=Lack of preference for conspecific calling songs in female crickets|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347296901013|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=51|issue=5|pages=981–990|doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0101|s2cid=53197021|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heterospecific mating ===
Heterospecific mating is when two individuals from different species mate. After the male transfers his sperm into the heterospecific female, different processes can occur that may change the outcome of the copulation. Heterospecific mating may result in the production of a hybrid in some pairings. Costs associated to heterospecific mating include the wastage of time, energy, and gametes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Examples ====
Spider mites – two closely related ''[[Panonychus]]'' mites: the ''Panonychus citri'' and ''Panonychus mori'', are generally geographically segregated and on occasion co-exist. However, the co-existence is not stable as the ''Panonychus mori'' is eventually excluded. The exclusion is a result of reproductive interference and also due to the higher reproductive rate of the ''Panonychus citri''. Heterospecific mating occurs between the two species which can produce infertile eggs or infertile hybrid females. Furthermore, females are not able to produce female offspring after mating with a heterospecific. In addition to the wastage of energy, time, and gametes, the inability to produce female offspring after heterospecific mating skews the sex ratio of the co-existing populations. The high costs associated with heterospecific mating along with the higher reproductive rate of the ''Panonychus citri'' lead to the displacement of the ''Panonychus mori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Takafuji|first1=Akio|last2=Kuno|first2=Eiji|last3=Fujimoto|first3=Hiroaki|date=1997-06-01|title=Reproductive interference and its consequences for the competitive interactions between two closely related Panonychus spider mites|journal=Experimental &amp; Applied Acarology|language=en|volume=21|issue=6|pages=379–391|doi=10.1023/A:1018423711166|s2cid=25099432|issn=1572-9702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females of both species that mate heterospecifically have a large reduction in fecundity compared to conspecific pairings. Heterospecific mating either produces no eggs or male hybrids that may be sterile. Both individuals suffer a large fitness cost from the wastage of energy, time, and gametes, as they unsuccessfully pass on their genes. However, females may be able to offset this cost through multiple mating, as they receive nutritional benefits from consuming a [[Nuptial gift|nuptial food gift]] from the male, otherwise known as the [[spermatophylax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=L.

The red deer are native to Britain and hybridise with the sika deer in areas which they co-exist. Heterospecific mating between the red deer and sika deer can produce viable hybrids. Sika deer and the hybrids may outcompete and displace native deer from dense woodland. As the complete eradication of sika and the hybrids is impractical, management efforts are directed at minimising spread by not planting vegetation that would facilitate their spread into regions where the red deer still persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hybridisation in British mammals|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4520|last1=Balharry|first1=E.|last2=Staines|first2=B.

'''Research in Computational Molecular Biology''' ('''RECOMB''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. The conference has been held every year since 1997 and is a major international conference in computational biology, alongside the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|ISMB]] and [[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] conferences.&lt;ref name=eccb-2010-editorial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreau|first1=Y|last2=Heringa|first2=J|title=Yves Moreau and Jaap Heringa, on behalf of the ECCB10 organizing and steering committees.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Sep 15, 2010|volume=26|issue=18|pages=i412–3|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq482|pmid=20823300|pmc=2935438}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference is affiliated with the [[International Society for Computational Biology]]. Since the first conference, authors of accepted proceedings papers have been invited to submit a revised version to a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Computational Biology]]''.&lt;ref name=jcb-partnership&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnerships|url=http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/partnership.html|accessdate=8 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809091409/http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/partnership.html|archive-date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RECOMB was established in 1997 by Sorin Istrail, [[Pavel Pevzner]] and [[Michael Waterman]]. The first conference was held at the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=recomb2014-proceedings /&gt;

A series of RECOMB Satellite meetings was established by [[Pavel Pevzner]] in 2001. These meetings cover specialist aspects of bioinformatics, including [[massively parallel sequencing]], [[comparative genomics]], [[Regulation of gene expression|regulatory genomics]] and bioinformatics education.&lt;ref name=satellites&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMB - Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology - History - RECOMB Satellite Workshops|url=http://www.recomb.org/22481/RECOMB-Satellite-Workshops|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of RECOMB 2010, the conference has included a highlights track, modelled on the success of a similar track at the ISMB conference. The highlights track contains presentations for computational biology papers published in the previous 18 months.&lt;ref name=recomb2014-proceedings /&gt;&lt;ref name=recomb-2010-highlights&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMB 2010 - Highlights Track|url=http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/highlights.html|accessdate=11 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323003759/http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/highlights.html|archive-date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 RECOMB and ''[[PLOS Computational Biology]]'' coordinated to let authors submit papers in parallel to both conference and journal. Papers not selected for publication in ''PLOS Computational Biology'' were published in edited form in the ''Journal of Computational Biology'' as usual.&lt;ref name=recomb2014-proceedings /&gt;&lt;ref name=plos-biologue&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pick of RECOMB 2014 - PLOS Biologue|url=http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2014/03/27/pick-recomb-2014/|website=blogs.plos.org|publisher=PLOS|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 the conference started a partnership with Cell Systems.  Each year, a subset of work accepted at RECOMB is also considered for publication in a special issue of [https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/home Cell Systems] devoted to RECOMB.  Other RECOMB papers are invited for a short synopsis (Cell Systems Calls)  in the same issue.

RECOMB steering committee is chaired by [[Bonnie Berger]].

      <text bytes="10169" xml:space="preserve">'''Respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP)''' is a method of evaluating [[pulmonary ventilation]] by measuring the movement of the chest and abdominal wall.

Accurate measurement of pulmonary ventilation or breathing often requires the use of devices such as masks or mouthpieces coupled to the airway opening. These devices are often both encumbering and invasive, and thus ill suited for continuous or ambulatory measurements. As an alternative '''RIP''' devices that sense respiratory excursions at the body surface can be used to measure pulmonary ventilation.

According to a paper by Konno and Mead  &lt;ref&gt;Konno K, and Mead J. (1967) measurement of the separate volume changes of rib cage and abdomen during breathing. J Appl Physiol 22: 407-422.&lt;/ref&gt; "the chest can be looked upon as a system of two compartments with only one degree of freedom each". Therefore, any [[volume]] change of the abdomen must be equal and opposite to that of the rib cage. The paper suggests that the volume change is close to being [[linearly]] related to changes in antero-posterior (front to back of body) diameter. When a known air volume is inhaled and measured with a [[spirometer]], a volume-motion relationship can be established as the sum of the abdominal and rib cage displacements. Therefore, according to this theory, only changes in the antero-posterior diameter of the abdomen and the rib cage are needed to estimate changes in lung volume.

Several sensor methodologies based on this theory have been developed. '''RIP''' is the most frequently used, established and accurate [[plethysmography]] method to estimate lung volume from respiratory movements.

RIP has been used in many clinical and academic research studies in a variety of domains including [[polysomnographic]] (sleep), psychophysiology, psychiatric research, anxiety and stress research, anesthesia, cardiology and pulmonary research (asthma, COPD, dyspnea).

==Technology==
A '''respiratory inductance plethysmograph''' consists of two [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] wire coils insulated and placed within two 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (about 1&amp;nbsp;inch) wide, lightweight elastic and adhesive bands. The [[transducer]] bands are placed around the rib cage under the armpits and around the abdomen at the level of the [[Navel|umbilicus]] (belly button). They are connected to an [[oscillator]] and subsequent frequency [[demodulation]] electronics to obtain digital waveforms.  During inspiration the cross-sectional area of the rib cage and abdomen increases altering the self-inductance of the coils and the frequency of their oscillation, with the increase in cross-sectional area proportional to lung volumes. The electronics convert this change in frequency to a digital respiration waveform where the amplitude of the waveform is proportional to the inspired breath volume. A typical  pitch of the wire sinusoid is in the range 1-2 cm and the inductance of the belt is ~ 2-4 microhenries per metre of belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=H. T. Ngo |author2=C. V.

==Single Vs. Dual Band Respiration==

===Dual Band Respiration===
Konno and Mead &lt;ref&gt;Konno K, and Mead J. (1967) measurement of the separate volume changes of rib cage and abdomen during breathing. J Appl Physiol 22: 407-422.&lt;/ref&gt; extensively evaluated a two-degrees-of-freedom model of chest wall motion, whereby ventilation could be derived from measurements of rib cage and abdomen displacements. With this model, [[tidal volume]] (Vt) was calculated as the sum of the anteroposterior dimensions of the rib cage and abdomen, and could be measured to within 10% of actual Vt as long as a given posture was maintained.

===Single Band Respiration===
Changes in volume of the thoracic cavity can also be inferred from displacements of the rib cage and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. Motion of the rib cage can be directly assessed, whereas the motion of the diaphragm is indirectly assessed as the outward movement of the anterolateral abdominal wall. 
However, accuracy issues arise when trying to assess accurate respiratory volumes from a single respiration band placed either at the thorax, abdomen or midline. Due to differences in posture and thoraco-abdominal respiratory synchronization it is not possible to obtain accurate respiratory volumes with a single band. Furthermore, the shape of the acquired waveform tends to be non-linear due to the non-exact co-ordination of the two respiratory compartments. This further limits quantification of many useful respiratory indices and limits utility to only respiration rates and other basic timing indices.  Therefore, to accurately perform volumetric respiratory measurements, a dual band respiratory sensor system must be required.

==RIP Data Analysis==
[[File:VivoSenseRIP.jpg|thumb|alt=VivoSenseRIP|Dual Band Measures in [http://www.vivosense.com/research-customized-analysis/ VivoSense Software]]]
Dual band respiratory inductance plethysmography can be used to describe various measures of complex respiratory patterns. The image shows waveforms and measures commonly analyzed.

'''''Respiratory rate''''' is the number of breaths per minute. A non-specific measure of respiratory disorder.

'''''Tidal volume (Vt)''''' is the volume inspired and expired with each breath. Variability in the wave form can be used to differentiate between restrictive (less) and obstructive pulmonary diseases as well as acute anxiety.

'''''Minute ventilation''''' is equivalent to tidal volume multiplied by respiratory rate and is used to assess metabolic activity.

'''''Peak inspiratory flow (PifVt)''''' is a measure that reflects respiratory drive, the higher its value, the greater the respiratory drive in the presence of coordinated thoraco-abdominal or even moderately discoordinated thoraco-abdominal movements.

'''''Fractional inspiratory time (Ti/Tt) ''''' is the "Duty cycle" (Ti/Tt, ratio of time of inspirationy to total breath time). Low values may reflect
severe airways obstruction and can also occur during speech. Higher values are observed when snoring.

'''''Work of breathing ''''' is a measure of  a "Rapid shallow breathing index".

'''''Peak/mean inspiratory and expiratory flow''''' measures the  presence of upper airway flow limitations during inspiration and expiration.

'''''%RCi''''' is the percent contribution of the rib cage excursions to the tidal volume Vt. The %RCi contribution to Tidal Volume ratio is obtained by dividing the inspired volume in the RC band by the inspired volume in the algebraic sum of RC + AB at the point of the peak of inspiratory tidal volume. This value is higher in woman than in men. The values are also generally higher during acute [[hyperventilation]].

'''''Phase Angle - Phi''''' - Normal breathing involves a combination of both thoracic and abdominal (diaphragmatic) movements. During inhalation, both the thoracic and abdominal cavities simultaneously expand in volume, and thus in girth as well. If there is a blockage in the trachea or nasopharynx, the phasing of these movements will shift in relation to the degree of the obstruction. In the case of a total obstruction, the strong chest muscles force the thorax to expand, pulling the diaphragm upward in what is referred to as "paradoxical" breathing – paradoxical in that the normal phases of thoracic and abdominal motion are reversed. This is commonly referred to as the '''Phase Angle'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer J, MD, Newth C.J.L, MB, FRCP, and Deakers T.W, MD, PhD (1995), Validation of the Phase Angle Technique as an Objective Measure of Upper Airway Obstruction, Pediatric Pulmonology 19:167-173&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Apnea]] &amp; [[hypopnea]] detection''''' - Diagnostic components of sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome and periodic breathing.

'''''Apnea &amp; hypopnea classification''''' - Phase relation between thorax and abdomen classifies apnea/hypopnea events into central, mixed, and obstructive types.

'''''qDEEL quantitative difference of end expiratory lung volume''''' is a change in the level of end expiratory lung volume and may be elevated in [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]] and periodic breathing.

==Accuracy==
Dual band respiratory inductance plethysmography was validated in determining tidal volume during exercise and shown to be accurate. A version of RIP embedded in a garment called the LifeShirt was used for these validation studies.&lt;ref&gt;Clarenbach C.F, Senn O, Brack T, Kohler Mand Bloch C.E (2005) Monitoring of Ventilation During Exercise by a Portable Respiratory Inductive Plethysmograph*, Chest 2005;128;1282-1290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kent L, O'Neill B,  Davison G, Nevill A, Elbornd J.S, Bradley J.M (2009) Validity and reliability of cardiorespiratory measurements recorded by the LifeShirt during exercise tests, Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology 167, 162–167&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''restriction enzyme''', '''restriction endonuclease''', '''REase''', '''ENase''' or'' '''restrictase''' '' is an [[enzyme]] that cleaves [[DNA]] into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within molecules known as [[restriction site]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid795607"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts RJ | title = Restriction endonucleases | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Biochemistry | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–64 | date = November 1976 | pmid = 795607 | doi = 10.3109/10409237609105456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2172084"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessler C, Manta V | title = Specificity of restriction endonucleases and DNA modification methyltransferases a review (Edition 3) | journal = Gene | volume = 92 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–248 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2172084 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(90)90486-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-89603-234-5"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pingoud A, Alves J, Geiger R | editor = Burrell M | title = Enzymes of Molecular Biology | publisher = Humana Press | location = Totowa, NJ | series= Methods of Molecular Biology | volume= 16 | year = 1993 | pages = 107–200 | chapter = Chapter 8: Restriction Enzymes | isbn = 0-89603-234-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Restriction enzymes are one class of the broader [[endonuclease]] group of enzymes. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA [[enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another. To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]] (i.e. each strand) of the [[DNA double helix]].

These enzymes are found in [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] and provide a defense mechanism against invading [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name="pmid4897066"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arber W, Linn S | title = DNA modification and restriction | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 38 | pages = 467–500 | year = 1969 | pmid = 4897066 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.38.070169.002343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6314109"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krüger DH, Bickle TA | title = Bacteriophage survival: multiple mechanisms for avoiding the deoxyribonucleic acid restriction systems of their hosts | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 345–60 | date = September 1983 | pmid = 6314109 | pmc = 281580 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.47.3.345-360.1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside a [[prokaryote]], the restriction enzymes selectively cut up ''foreign'' DNA in a process called ''restriction digestion''; meanwhile, host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme (a [[methyltransferase]]) that [[DNA methylation|modifies]] the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage.

== History ==
The term restriction enzyme originated from the studies of [[lambda phage|phage λ]], a virus that infects bacteria, and the phenomenon of host-controlled restriction and modification of such bacterial phage or [[bacteriophage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Genes to Clones |author=Winnacker E-L |publisher=VCH |year=1987 |chapter=Chapter 2: Isolation, Identification, and Characterisation of DNA fragments |isbn=0-89573-614-4 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/fromgenestoclone0000winn }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was first identified in work done in the laboratories of [[Salvador Luria]], [[Jean Weigle]] and Giuseppe Bertani in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Luria_Human_1952"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luria SE, Human ML | title = A nonhereditary, host-induced variation of bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 557–69 | date = October 1952 | pmid = 12999684 | pmc = 169391 | doi = 10.1128/JB.64.4.557-569.1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13034700"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertani G, Weigle JJ | title = Host controlled variation in bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–21 | date = February 1953 | pmid = 13034700 | pmc = 169650 | doi = 10.1128/JB.65.2.113-121.1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was found that, for a bacteriophage λ that can grow well in one strain of ''Escherichia coli'', for example ''E. coli'' C, when grown in another strain, for example ''E. coli'' K, its yields can drop significantly, by as much as 3-5 orders of magnitude. The host cell, in this example ''E. coli'' K, is known as the restricting host and appears to have the ability to reduce the biological activity of the phage λ. If a phage becomes established in one strain, the ability of that phage to grow also becomes restricted in other strains. In the 1960s, it was shown in work done in the laboratories of [[Werner Arber]] and [[Matthew Meselson]] that the restriction is caused by an enzymatic cleavage of the phage DNA, and the enzyme involved was therefore termed a restriction enzyme.&lt;ref name="pmid4897066" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4868368"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meselson M, Yuan R | title = DNA restriction enzyme from E. coli | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5134 | pages = 1110–4 | date = March 1968 | pmid = 4868368 | doi = 10.1038/2171110a0 | bibcode = 1968Natur.217.1110M | s2cid = 4172829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13888713"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dussoix D, Arber W | title = Host specificity of DNA produced by Escherichia coli.

== Recognition site ==
[[File:EcoRV Restriction Site.rsh.svg|thumb|right|A palindromic recognition site reads the same on the reverse strand as it does on the forward strand when both are read in the same orientation]]
Restriction enzymes recognize a specific sequence of nucleotides&lt;ref name="pmid2172084"/&gt; and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA. The recognition sequences can also be classified by the number of bases in its recognition site, usually between 4 and 8 bases, and the number of bases in the sequence will determine how often the site will appear by chance in any given genome, e.g., a 4-base pair sequence would theoretically occur once every 4^4 or 256bp, 6 bases, 4^6 or 4,096bp, and 8 bases would be 4^8 or 65,536bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Cooper S |title=Restriction Map |url= http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/genweb/molecular/seq_anal/restriction_map/restriction_map.htm |website=bioweb.uwlax.edu |publisher=University of Wisconsin |access-date=10 May 2021 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are [[Palindromic sequence|palindromic]], meaning the base sequence reads the same backwards and forwards.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pingoud A, Jeltsch A | title = Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3705–27 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11557805 | pmc = 55916 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, there are two types of palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA. The ''mirror-like'' palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence reads the same forward and backward on a single strand of DNA, as in GTAATG. The ''inverted repeat'' palindrome is also a sequence that reads the same forward and backward, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., of double-stranded DNA), as in GTATAC (GTATAC being [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to CATATG).&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-175551-7"&gt;{{cite book | author = Clark DP | title = Molecular biology | publisher = Elsevier Academic Press | location = Amsterdam | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-12-175551-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverted repeat palindromes are more common and have greater biological importance than mirror-like palindromes.

Recognition sequences in DNA differ for each restriction enzyme, producing differences in the length, sequence and strand orientation ([[5' end]] or [[3' end]]) of a [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky-end]] "overhang" of an enzyme restriction.&lt;ref name="pmid11897876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodsell DS | title = The molecular perspective: restriction endonucleases | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–1 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11897876 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.20-2-190 | s2cid = 222199041 | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/7/1/82.full.pdf | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence are known as [[neoschizomer]]s. These often cleave in different locales of the sequence. Different enzymes that recognize and cleave in the same location are known as [[isoschizomer]]s.

Naturally occurring restriction endonucleases are categorized into five groups (Types I, II, III, IV, and V) based on their composition and [[enzyme cofactor]] requirements, the nature of their target sequence, and the position of their DNA cleavage site relative to the target sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid8336674"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 | doi =  10.1128/MMBR.57.2.434-450.1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4949033"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyer HW | title = DNA restriction and modification mechanisms in bacteria | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 25 | pages = 153–76 | year = 1971 | pmid = 4949033 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.25.100171.001101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6267988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuan R | title = Structure and mechanism of multifunctional restriction endonucleases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 50 | pages = 285–319 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6267988 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.50.070181.001441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA sequence analysis of restriction enzymes however show great variations, indicating that there are more than four types.&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt; All types of enzymes recognize specific short DNA sequences and carry out the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates.

* Type I enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.3}}) cleave at sites remote from a recognition site; require both ATP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine to function; multifunctional protein with both restriction digestion and methylase ({{EC number|2.1.1.72}}) activities.
* Type II enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.4}}) cleave within or at short specific distances from a recognition site; most require magnesium; single function (restriction digestion) enzymes independent of methylase.
* Type III enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.5}}) cleave at sites a short distance from a recognition site; require ATP (but do not hydrolyse it); S-adenosyl-L-methionine stimulates the reaction but is not required; exist as part of a complex with a modification methylase ({{EC number|2.1.1.72}}).
* Type IV enzymes target modified DNA, e.g. methylated, hydroxymethylated and glucosyl-hydroxymethylated DNA
* Type V enzymes utilize guide RNAs (gRNAs)

=== Type l ===
Type I restriction enzymes were the first to be identified and were first identified in two different strains (K-12 and B) of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid10839821"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray NE | title = Type I restriction systems: sophisticated molecular machines (a legacy of Bertani and Weigle) | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 412–34 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10839821 | pmc = 98998 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.64.2.412-434.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions—one containing 3–4 nucleotides, and another containing 4–5 nucleotides—separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6–8 nucleotides. These enzymes are multifunctional and are capable of both restriction digestion and modification activities, depending upon the methylation status of the target DNA. The cofactors [[S-Adenosyl methionine]] (AdoMet), hydrolyzed adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) [[ion]]s, are required for their full activity. Type I restriction enzymes possess three subunits called HsdR, HsdM, and HsdS; HsdR is required for restriction digestion; HsdM is necessary for adding [[methyl]] groups to host DNA (methyltransferase activity), and HsdS is important for specificity of the recognition (DNA-binding) site in addition to both restriction digestion (DNA cleavage) and modification (DNA methyltransferase) activity.&lt;ref name="pmid8336674"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10839821"/&gt;

Typical type II restriction enzymes differ from type I restriction enzymes in several ways. They form [[homodimer]]s, with recognition sites that are usually undivided and palindromic and 4–8 nucleotides in length. They recognize and cleave DNA at the same site, and they do not use ATP or AdoMet for their activity—they usually require only Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt;  These enzymes cleave the phosphodiester bond of double helix DNA. It can either cleave at the center of both strands to yield a blunt end, or at a staggered position leaving overhangs called sticky ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology| vauthors = Ninfa JP, Balou DP, Benore M |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=978-0-470-08766-4|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the most commonly available and used restriction enzymes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, new enzymes from this family were discovered that did not follow all the classical criteria of this enzyme class, and new subfamily [[nomenclature]] was developed to divide this large family into subcategories based on deviations from typical characteristics of type II enzymes.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; These subgroups are defined using a letter suffix.

Type IIB restriction enzymes (e.g., BcgI and BplI) are [[multimer]]s, containing more than one subunit.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; They cleave DNA on both sides of their recognition to cut out the recognition site. They require both AdoMet and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cofactors. Type IIE restriction endonucleases (e.g., NaeI) cleave DNA following interaction with two copies of their recognition sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; One recognition site acts as the target for cleavage, while the other acts as an [[Allosteric regulation|allosteric effector]] that speeds up or improves the efficiency of enzyme cleavage. Similar to type IIE enzymes, type IIF restriction endonucleases (e.g. NgoMIV) interact with two copies of their recognition sequence but cleave both sequences at the same time.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIG restriction endonucleases (e.g., RM.Eco57I) do have a single subunit, like classical Type II restriction enzymes, but require the cofactor AdoMet to be active.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIM restriction endonucleases, such as DpnI, are able to recognize and cut methylated DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siwek W, Czapinska H, Bochtler M, Bujnicki JM, Skowronek K | title = Crystal structure and mechanism of action of the N6-methyladenine-dependent type IIM restriction endonuclease R.DpnI | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 15 | pages = 7563–72 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22610857 | pmc = 3424567 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mierzejewska K, Siwek W, Czapinska H, Kaus-Drobek M, Radlinska M, Skowronek K, Bujnicki JM, Dadlez M, Bochtler M | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis of the methylation specificity of R.DpnI | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 13 | pages = 8745–54 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24966351 | pmc = 4117772 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gku546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type IIS restriction endonucleases (e.g., ''Fok''I) cleave DNA at a defined distance from their non-palindromic asymmetric recognition sites;&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; this characteristic is widely used to perform in-vitro cloning techniques such as [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden Gate cloning]]. These enzymes may function as [[protein dimer|dimer]]s. Similarly, Type IIT restriction enzymes (e.g., Bpu10I and BslI) are composed of two different subunits. Some recognize palindromic sequences while others have asymmetric recognition sites.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt;

=== Type III ===
Type III restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoP15) recognize two separate non-palindromic sequences that are inversely oriented. They cut DNA about 20–30 base pairs after the recognition site.&lt;ref name="pmid11557806"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dryden DT, Murray NE, Rao DN | title = Nucleoside triphosphate-dependent restriction enzymes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3728–41 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11557806 | pmc = 55918 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes contain more than one subunit and require AdoMet and ATP cofactors for their roles in DNA methylation and restriction digestion, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid1734285"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meisel A, Bickle TA, Krüger DH, Schroeder C | title = Type III restriction enzymes need two inversely oriented recognition sites for DNA cleavage | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6359 | pages = 467–9 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1734285 | doi = 10.1038/355467a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..467M | s2cid = 4354056 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are components of [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] DNA restriction-modification [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that protect the organism against invading foreign DNA. Type III enzymes are hetero-oligomeric, multifunctional [[protein]]s composed of two subunits, Res ({{uniProt|P08764}}) and Mod ({{uniProt|P08763}}). The Mod subunit recognises the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification [[methyltransferase]]; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonuclease. Res is required for restriction digestion, although it has no [[enzyme|enzymatic]] activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognise short 5–6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25–27 bp [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction digestion to occur. These enzymes [[DNA methylation|methylate]] only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction digestion. Type III enzymes belong to the beta-subfamily of [[DNA methyltransferase|N6 adenine methyltransferases]], containing the nine [[protein motif|motif]]s that characterise this family, including [[sequence motif|motif]] I, the [[S-adenosyl-L-methionine|AdoMet]] binding pocket (FXGXG), and motif IV, the [[catalytic]] region (S/D/N (PP) Y/F).&lt;ref name="pmid15121719"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12595133"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bourniquel AA, Bickle TA | title = Complex restriction enzymes: NTP-driven molecular motors | journal = Biochimie | volume = 84 | issue = 11 | pages = 1047–59 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12595133 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(02)00020-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type IV enzymes recognize modified, typically methylated DNA and are exemplified by the&amp;nbsp;McrBC&amp;nbsp;and Mrr systems of&amp;nbsp;''E. coli''.&lt;ref name="neb"&gt;[https://www.neb.com/products/restriction-endonucleases/restriction-endonucleases/types-of-restriction-endonucleases Types of Restriction Endonucleases | NEB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type V===
Type V restriction enzymes (e.g., the [[cas9]]-gRNA complex from [[CRISPR]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) utilize guide RNAs to target specific non-palindromic sequences found on invading organisms. They can cut DNA of variable length, provided that a suitable guide RNA is provided.

==Applications==
{{Main|Restriction digest}}
Isolated restriction enzymes are used to manipulate DNA for different scientific applications.

They are used to assist insertion of genes into [[plasmid vector]]s during [[gene cloning]] and [[protein production]] experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short ''polylinker'' sequence (called the [[multiple cloning site]], or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since it is necessary to avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a [[DNA ligase]].&lt;ref name="urlCloning using restriction enzymes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/restriction_enzymes/ | title = Cloning using restriction enzymes | author = Geerlof A | publisher = European Molecular Biology Laboratory - Hamburg | access-date = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-576-5"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-87969-576-5 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/molecularcloning0000samb_p7p5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restriction enzymes can also be used to distinguish gene [[allele]]s by specifically recognizing single base changes in DNA known as [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs).&lt;ref name="pmid18330346"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JN, Gemmell NJ | title = Combining allele-specific fluorescent probes and restriction assay in real-time PCR to achieve SNP scoring beyond allele ratios of 1:1000 | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–4, 196, 199 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18330346 | doi = 10.2144/000112719 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15980518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang R, Zhu Z, Zhu H, Nguyen T, Yao F, Xia K, Liang D, Liu C | display-authors = 6 | title = SNP Cutter: a comprehensive tool for SNP PCR-RFLP assay design | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W489-92 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15980518 | pmc = 1160119 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gki358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is however only possible if a SNP alters the restriction site present in the allele. In this method, the restriction enzyme can be used to [[genotype]] a DNA sample without the need for expensive [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]]. The sample is first digested with the restriction enzyme to generate DNA fragments, and then the different sized fragments separated by [[gel electrophoresis]]. In general, alleles with correct restriction sites will generate two visible bands of DNA on the gel, and those with altered restriction sites will not be cut and will generate only a single band. A [[restriction map|DNA map]] by restriction digest can also be generated that can give the relative positions of the genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/mapping-282 |title=Mapping |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The different lengths of DNA generated by restriction digest also produce a specific pattern of bands after gel electrophoresis, and can be used for [[DNA fingerprinting]].

In a similar manner, restriction enzymes are used to digest [[genomic]] DNA for gene analysis by [[Southern blot]]. This technique allows researchers to identify how many copies (or [[paralogue]]s) of a gene are present in the genome of one individual, or how many gene [[mutation]]s ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]) have occurred within a population. The latter example is called [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism|restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP).&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4684-0"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | edition = Fifth | publisher = W.H.

Artificial restriction enzymes created by linking the ''Fok''I DNA cleavage domain with an array of DNA binding proteins or zinc finger arrays, denoted zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), are a powerful tool for host genome editing due to their enhanced sequence specificity. ZFN work in pairs, their dimerization being mediated in-situ through the ''Fok''I domain. Each zinc finger array (ZFA) is capable of recognizing 9–12 base pairs, making for 18–24 for the pair. A 5–7 bp spacer between the cleavage sites further enhances the specificity of ZFN, making them a safe and more precise tool that can be applied in humans. A recent Phase I clinical trial of ZFN for the targeted abolition of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV-1 has been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tebas P, Stein D, Tang WW, Frank I, Wang SQ, Lee G, Spratt SK, Surosky RT, Giedlin MA, Nichol G, Holmes MC, Gregory PD, Ando DG, Kalos M, Collman RG, Binder-Scholl G, Plesa G, Hwang WT, Levine BL, June CH | display-authors = 6 | title = Gene editing of CCR5 in autologous CD4 T cells of persons infected with HIV | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 10 | pages = 901–10 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24597865 | pmc = 4084652 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1300662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have proposed using the bacteria R-M system as a model for devising human anti-viral gene or genomic vaccines and therapies since the RM system serves an innate defense-role in bacteria by restricting tropism by bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wayengera M |title= HIV and Gene Therapy: The proposed [R-M enzymatic] model for a gene therapy against HIV. |journal=Makerere Med J. |year=2003 |volume=38 |pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is research on REases and ZFN that can cleave the DNA of various human viruses, including [[Herpes simplex virus|HSV-2]], high-risk [[HPV]]s and [[HIV-1]], with the ultimate goal of inducing target mutagenesis and aberrations of human-infecting viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wayengera M, Kajumbula H, Byarugaba W |title= Frequency and site mapping of HIV-1/SIVcpz, HIV-2/SIVsmm and Other SIV gene sequence cleavage by various bacteria restriction enzymes: Precursors for a novel HIV inhibitory product |journal= Afr J Biotechnol |year=2007 |volume= 6 |issue=10 |pages=1225–1232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiffer JT, Aubert M, Weber ND, Mintzer E, Stone D, Jerome KR | title = Targeted DNA mutagenesis for the cure of chronic viral infections | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 86 | issue = 17 | pages = 8920–36 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22718830 | pmc = 3416169 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00052-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manjunath N, Yi G, Dang Y, Shankar P | title = Newer gene editing technologies toward HIV gene therapy | journal = Viruses | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 2748–66 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24284874 | pmc = 3856413 | doi = 10.3390/v5112748 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human genome already contains remnants of retroviral genomes that have been inactivated and harnessed for self-gain. Indeed, the mechanisms for silencing active L1 genomic retroelements by the three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) and excision repair cross complementing 1(ERCC) appear to mimic the action of RM-systems in bacteria, and the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) that follows the use of ZFN without a repair template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stetson DB, Ko JS, Heidmann T, Medzhitov R | title = Trex1 prevents cell-intrinsic initiation of autoimmunity | journal = Cell | volume = 134 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–98 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18724932 | pmc = 2626626 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gasior SL, Roy-Engel AM, Deininger PL | title = ERCC1/XPF limits L1 retrotransposition | journal = DNA Repair | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 983–9 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18396111 | pmc = 2483505 | doi = 10.1016/j.dnarep.2008.02.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RT_PCR_Model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|RT-PCR]]
'''Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction''' ('''RT-PCR''') is a laboratory technique combining [[reverse transcription]] of [[RNA]] into [[DNA]] (in this context called [[complementary DNA]] or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).&lt;ref name="pmid9894600"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman WM, Walker SJ, Vrana KE|author-link3=Kent Vrana |title=Quantitative RT-PCR: pitfalls and potential |journal=[[BioTechniques]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=112–22, 124–5 |date=January 1999 |pmid=9894600 |doi= 10.2144/99261rv01|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|real-time PCR]] or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined RT-PCR and qPCR are routinely used for analysis of [[gene expression]] and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings.

The close association between RT-PCR and qPCR has led to [[Metonymy|metonymic]] use of the term qPCR to mean RT-PCR. Such use may be confusing,&lt;ref name="Mackay, Ian 2007 440"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mackay, Ian |title=Real-time PCR in Microbiology: From Diagnosis to Characterization |url=https://archive.org/details/realtimepcrmicro00mack |url-access=limited |publisher=Caister Academic Press |location=Norfolk, England |year=2007 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/realtimepcrmicro00mack/page/n449 440] |isbn=978-1-904455-18-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as RT-PCR can be used without qPCR, for example to enable [[molecular cloning]], [[RNA-Seq|sequencing]] or simple detection of RNA. Conversely, qPCR may be used without RT-PCR, for example to quantify the [[Copy number analysis|copy number]] of a specific piece of DNA.

==History==

Since its introduction in 1977, [[Northern blot]] has been used extensively for RNA quantification despite its shortcomings: (a) time-consuming technique, (b) requires a large quantity of RNA for detection, and (c) quantitatively inaccurate in the low abundance of RNA content.&lt;ref name="pmid414220"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alwine JC, Kemp DJ, Stark GR |title=Method for detection of specific RNAs in agarose gels by transfer to diazobenzyloxymethyl-paper and hybridization with DNA probes |journal=Proc.

RT-PCR has risen to become the benchmark technology for the detection and/or comparison of RNA levels for several reasons: (a) it does not require post PCR processing, (b) a wide range (&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;-fold) of RNA abundance can be measured, and (c) it provides insight into both qualitative and quantitative data.&lt;ref name="pmid15956331"/&gt; Due to its simplicity, specificity and sensitivity, RT-PCR is used in a wide range of [[Applications of PCR|applications]] from experiments as simple as quantification of [[yeast|yeast cells]] in wine to more complex uses as diagnostic tools for detecting infectious agents such as the [[avian flu]] [[virus]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]].&lt;ref name="pmid17088381"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hierro N, Esteve-Zarzoso B, González A, Mas A, Guillamón JM |title=Real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) and reverse transcription-QPCR for detection and enumeration of total yeasts in wine |journal=Appl.

== Principles ==

In RT-PCR, the [[RNA]] template is first converted into a [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) using a [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT). The cDNA is then used as a template for exponential amplification using PCR. The use of RT-PCR for the detection of RNA transcript has revolutionized the study of gene expression in the following important ways:
* Made it theoretically possible to detect the transcripts of practically any gene&lt;ref name="pmid18645596"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Deepak S, Kottapalli K, Rakwal R, etal |title=Real-Time PCR: Revolutionizing Detection and Expression Analysis of Genes |journal=Curr.

=== One-step RT-PCR vs two-step RT-PCR ===
[[File:One-step vs two-step RT-PCR.jpg|thumb|450px|One-step vs two-step RT-PCR]]
The quantification of [[mRNA]] using RT-PCR can be achieved as either a one-step or a two-step reaction. The difference between the two approaches lies in the number of tubes used when performing the procedure. The two-step reaction requires that the reverse transcriptase reaction and PCR amplification be performed in separate tubes. The disadvantage of the two-step approach is susceptibility to contamination due to more frequent sample handling.&lt;ref name="pmid16060372"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wong ML, Medrano JF|date=July 2005|title=Real-time PCR for mRNA quantitation|journal=BioTechniques|volume=39|issue=1|pages=75–85|doi=10.2144/05391rv01|pmid=16060372|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the entire reaction from cDNA synthesis to PCR amplification occurs in a single tube in the one-step approach. The one-step approach is thought to minimize experimental variation by containing all of the enzymatic reactions in a single environment. It eliminates the steps of pipetting cDNA product, which is labor-intensive and prone to contamination, to PCR reaction. The further use of inhibitor-tolerant polymerases, polymerase enhancers with an optimized one-step RT-PCR condition, supports the reverse transcription of the RNA from unpurified or crude samples, such as [[whole blood]] and [[serum (blood)|serum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Lang|last2=He|first2=Jian-an|last3=Wang|first3=Wei|last4=Xia|first4=Yun|last5=Song|first5=Li|last6=Chen|first6=Ze-han|last7=Zuo|first7=Hang-zhi|last8=Tan|first8=Xuan-Ping|last9=Ho|first9=Aaron Ho-Pui|last10=Kong|first10=Siu-Kai|last11=Loo|first11=Jacky Fong-Chuen|date=2019-08-01|title=Development of a direct reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (dirRT-qPCR) assay for clinical Zika diagnosis|url=https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(19)30252-8/abstract|journal=International Journal of Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=85|pages=167–174|doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2019.06.007|issn=1201-9712|pmid=31202908|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bachofen|first1=Claudia|last2=Willoughby|first2=Kim|last3=Zadoks|first3=Ruth|last4=Burr|first4=Paul|last5=Mellor|first5=Dominic|last6=Russell|first6=George C.|date=2013-06-01|title=Direct RT-PCR from serum enables fast and cost-effective phylogenetic analysis of bovine viral diarrhoea virus|journal=Journal of Virological Methods|volume=190|issue=1|pages=1–3|doi=10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.03.015|pmid=23541784|issn=0166-0934}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the starting RNA templates are prone to degradation in the one-step approach, and the use of this approach is not recommended when repeated assays from the same sample is required. Additionally, the one-step approach is reported to be less accurate compared to the two-step approach. It is also the preferred method of analysis when using DNA binding dyes such as [[SYBR Green]] since the elimination of [[primer-dimer]]s can be achieved through a simple change in the [[melting point|melting temperature]]. Nevertheless, the one-step approach is a relatively convenient solution for the rapid detection of target RNA directly in biosensing.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

=== End-point RT-PCR vs real-time RT-PCR ===
Quantification of RT-PCR products can largely be divided into two categories: end-point and real-time.&lt;ref name="pmid11017702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmittgen TD, Zakrajsek BA, Mills AG, Gorn V, Singer MJ, Reed MW |s2cid=258810 |title=Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to study mRNA decay: comparison of endpoint and real-time methods |journal=Anal.

; Relative RT-PCR: Relative quantifications of RT-PCR involves the co-amplification of an internal control simultaneously with the gene of interest. The internal control is used to normalize the samples. Once normalized, a direct comparison of relative transcript abundances across multiple samples of mRNA can be made. One precaution to note is that the internal control must be chosen so that it is not affected by the experimental treatment. The expression level should be constant across all samples and with the mRNA of interest for the results to be accurate and meaningful. Because the quantification of the results are analyzed by comparing the linear range of the target and control amplification, it is crucial to take into consideration the starting target molecules concentration and their amplification rate prior to starting the analysis. The results of the analysis are expressed as the ratios of gene signal to internal control signal, which the values can then be used for the comparison between the samples in the estimation of relative target RNA expression.&lt;ref name="pmid7787020"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7522722"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gause WC, Adamovicz J |title=The use of the PCR to quantitate gene expression |journal=Genome Research |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=S123–35 |date=June 1994 |pmid=7522722 |doi= 10.1101/gr.3.6.s123|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Competitive RT-PCR: Competitive RT-PCR technique is used for absolute quantification. It involves the use of a synthetic “competitor” RNA that can be distinguished from the target RNA by a small difference in size or sequence. It is important for the design of the synthetic RNA be identical in sequence but slightly shorter than the target RNA for accurate results. Once designed and synthesized, a known amount of the competitor RNA is added to experimental samples and is co-amplified with the target using RT-PCR. Then, a concentration curve of the competitor RNA is produced and it is used to compare the RT-PCR signals produced from the endogenous transcripts to determine the amount of target present in the sample.&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8922627"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsai SJ, Wiltbank MC |title=Quantification of mRNA using competitive RT-PCR with standard-curve methodology |journal=BioTechniques |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=862–6 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8922627 |doi= 10.2144/96215st04|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Comparative RT-PCR: Comparative RT-PCR is similar to the competitive RT-PCR in that the target RNA competes for amplification reagents within a single reaction with an internal standard of unrelated sequence. Once the reaction is complete, the results are compared to an external standard curve to determine the target RNA concentration. In comparison to the relative and competitive quantification methods, comparative RT-PCR is considered to be the more convenient method to use since it does not require the investigator to perform a pilot experiment; in relative RT-PCR, the exponential amplification range of the mRNA must be predetermined and in competitive RT-PCR, a synthetic competitor RNA must be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12618301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9888974"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halford WP, Falco VC, Gebhardt BM, Carr DJ |title=The inherent quantitative capacity of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction |journal=Anal.

==== Real-time RT-PCR ====

The emergence of novel fluorescent DNA labeling techniques in the past few years has enabled the analysis and detection of PCR products in real-time and has consequently led to the widespread adoption of real-time RT-PCR for the analysis of gene expression. Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA [[Hybridization probe|probes]] available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[molecular beacon]]s, and [[scorpion probe]]s. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes', molecular beacons' and scorpions' generation of fluorescence depend on [[Förster resonance energy transfer|Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Wang | first2 = L. | chapter = Quantitative Real-Time PCR: Fluorescent Probe Options and Issues | doi = 10.1007/4243_2008_046 | title = Standardization and Quality Assurance in Fluorescence Measurements II | series = Springer Series on Fluorescence | volume = 6 | pages = 489 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-540-70570-3 | chapter-url = https://zenodo.org/record/1232956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[SYBR Green]]: When the SYBR Green binds to the double-stranded DNA of the PCR products, it will emit light upon excitation. The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.&lt;ref name="pmid11017702"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11227069"/&gt;
[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman probes]]
; [[TaqMan]] probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.&lt;ref name="pmid11017702"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18645596"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15613819"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J. Vet. Sci. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=345–51 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15613819 |doi= 10.4142/jvs.2004.5.4.345|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these probes are light sensitive and must be carefully frozen as aliquots to prevent degradation. 
; [[Molecular beacon|Molecular beacon probes]]: Similar to the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons also make use of FRET detection with fluorescent probes attached to the 5' end and a quencher attached to the 3' end of an oligonucleotide substrate. However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.&lt;ref name="pmid16060372"/&gt;
; Scorpion probes: The scorpion probes, like molecular beacons, will not be fluorescent active in an unhybridized state, again, due to the fluorescent probe on the 5' end being quenched by the moiety on the 3' end of an oligonucleotide. With Scorpions, however, the 3' end also contains sequence that is complementary to the extension product of the primer on the 5' end. When the Scorpion extension binds to its complement on the amplicon, the Scorpion structure opens, prevents FRET, and enables the fluorescent signal to be measured.&lt;ref name="pmid15240248"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharkey FH, Banat IM, Marchant R |title=Detection and quantification of gene expression in environmental bacteriology |journal=Appl.

; Multiplex probes: TaqMan probes, molecular beacons, and scorpions allow the concurrent measurement of PCR products in a single tube. This is possible because each of the different fluorescent dyes can be associated with a specific emission spectra. Not only does the use of multiplex probes save time and effort without compromising test utility, its application in wide areas of research such as gene deletion analysis, mutation and polymorphism analysis, quantitative analysis, and RNA detection, make it an invaluable technique for laboratories of many discipline.&lt;ref name="pmid15240248"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17489437"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ratcliff RM, Chang G, Kok T, Sloots TP |title=Molecular diagnosis of medical viruses |journal=Curr Issues Mol Biol |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=87–102 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17489437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11023957"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elnifro EM, Ashshi AM, Cooper RJ, Klapper PE |title=Multiplex PCR: optimization and application in diagnostic virology |journal=Clin.

Two strategies are commonly employed to quantify the results obtained by real-time RT-PCR; the standard curve method and the comparative threshold method.&lt;ref name="pmid16013967"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bustin SA |s2cid=1833811 |title=Real-time, fluorescence-based quantitative PCR: a snapshot of current procedures and preferences |journal=Expert Rev.

== Application ==

The exponential amplification via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction provides for a highly sensitive technique in which a very low copy number of RNA molecules can be detected. RT-PCR is widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and, semiquantitatively, in the determination of the abundance of specific different RNA molecules within a cell or tissue as a measure of [[Gene expression#Techniques and tools|gene expression]].

=== Research methods ===

RT-PCR is commonly used in research methods to measure gene expression. For example, Lin et al. used qRT-PCR to measure expression of Gal genes in yeast cells. First, Lin et al. engineered a mutation of a protein suspected to participate in the regulation of Gal genes. This mutation was hypothesized to selectively abolish Gal expression. To confirm this, gene expression levels of yeast cells containing this mutation were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The researchers were able to conclusively determine that the mutation of this regulatory protein reduced Gal expression.&lt;ref name="pmid22308403"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin L, Chamberlain L, Zhu LJ, Green MR | title = Analysis of Gal4-directed transcription activation using Tra1 mutants selectively defective for interaction with Gal4 | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 109 | issue = 6 | pages = 1997–2002 |date=February 2012 | pmid = 22308403 | pmc = 3277556 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1116340109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.1997L | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern blot]] analysis is used to study the RNA's gene expression further.

=== Gene insertion ===

RT-PCR can also be very useful in the insertion of [[eukaryotic]] genes into [[prokaryotes]]. Because most eukaryotic genes contain [[introns]], which are present in the genome but not in the mature mRNA, the cDNA generated from a RT-PCR reaction is the exact (without regard to the error-prone nature of reverse transcriptases) DNA sequence that would be directly translated into [[protein]] after [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. When these genes are expressed in prokaryotic cells for the sake of protein production or purification, the RNA produced directly from transcription need not undergo splicing as the transcript contains only [[exons]]. (Prokaryotes, such as E. coli, lack the mRNA splicing mechanism of eukaryotes).

=== Genetic disease diagnosis ===
RT-PCR can be used to diagnose [[genetic disease]] such as [[Lesch–Nyhan syndrome]]. This genetic disease is caused by a malfunction in the [[HPRT1]] gene, which clinically leads to the fatal [[urinary stone|uric acid urinary stone]] and symptoms similar to [[gout]].{{clarify|text=[6]|date=April 2020}} Analyzing a pregnant mother and a [[fetus]] for mRNA expression levels of HPRT1 will reveal if the mother is a carrier and if the fetus will likely to develop Lesch–Nyhan syndrome.&lt;ref name="pmid23046577"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Torres RJ, Garcia MG, Puig JG | title = Carrier and prenatal diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan disease due to a defect in HPRT gene expression regulation | journal = Gene | volume = 511 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–7 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23046577 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer detection ===
Scientists are working on ways to use RT-PCR in [[cancer]] detection to help improve [[prognosis]], and monitor response to therapy. Circulating [[tumor cell]]s produce unique mRNA transcripts depending on the type of cancer. The goal is to determine which mRNA transcripts serve as the best [[biomarkers]] for a particular cancer cell type and then analyze its expression levels with RT-PCR.&lt;ref name="pmid17525108"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xi L, Nicastri DG, El-Hefnawy T, Hughes SJ, Luketich JD, Godfrey TE | title = Optimal markers for real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR detection of circulating tumor cells from melanoma, breast, colon, esophageal, head and neck, and lung cancers | journal = Clin. Chem. | volume = 53 | issue = 7 | pages = 1206–15 |date=July 2007 | pmid = 17525108 | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2006.081828 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RT-PCR is commonly used in studying the genomes of [[virus]]es whose genomes are composed of RNA, such as [[Influenzavirus A]], [[retrovirus]]es like [[HIV]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coronavirus: il viaggio dei test |url=https://www.iss.it/web/guest/primo-piano/-/asset_publisher/o4oGR9qmvUz9/content/id/5269706 |website=Istituto Superiore di Sanità}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

Despite its major advantages, RT-PCR is not without drawbacks. The exponential growth of the reverse transcribed [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) during the multiple cycles of PCR produces inaccurate end point quantification due to the difficulty in maintaining linearity.&lt;ref name="pmid14664723"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shiao YH |title=A new reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method for accurate quantification |journal=BMC Biotechnol. |volume=3 |page=22 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14664723 |pmc=317330 |doi=10.1186/1472-6750-3-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to provide accurate detection and quantification of RNA content in a sample, qRT-PCR was developed using fluorescence-based modification to monitor the amplification products during each cycle of PCR. The extreme sensitivity of the technique can be a double edged sword since even the slightest DNA contamination can lead to undesirable results.&lt;ref name="pmid9464395"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gettemy JM, Ma B, Alic M, Gold MH |title=Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the regulation of the manganese peroxidase gene family |journal=Appl.

==Protocol==
{{Manual|section|date=August 2016}}
RT-PCR can be carried out by the one-step RT-PCR protocol or the two-step RT-PCR protocol.

===One-step RT-PCR===
One-step RT-PCR subjects mRNA targets (up to 6 kb) to reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification in a single test tube. It is important to note that using intact, high quality RNA and a sequence-specific primer will produce the best results.

Once a one-step RT-PCR kit with a mix of reverse transcriptase, Taq DNA polymerase, and a proofreading polymerase is selected and all necessary materials and equipment are obtained a reaction mix is to be prepared. The reaction mix includes dNTPs, primers, template RNA, necessary enzymes, and a buffer solution. The reaction mix is added to a PCR tube for each reaction, followed by template RNA. The PCR tubes are then placed in a thermal cycler to begin cycling. In the first cycle, synthesis of cDNA occurs. The second cycle is the initial denaturation wherein reverse transcriptase is inactivated. The remaining 40-50 cycles are the amplification, which includes denaturation, annealing, and elongation. When amplification is complete, the RT-PCR products can be analyzed with [[gel electrophoresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Transcript Tools OneStep Kit|url=http://www.biotools.eu/reverse_transcription.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520151713/http://www.biotools.eu/reverse_transcription.html|archive-date=20 May 2013|access-date=12 December 2012|publisher=Biotools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Degen|first=Hans-Joachim|url=http://www.roche-applied-science.com/publications/print_mat/pcr_application_manual_3rd_edition.pdf|title=PCR Applications Manual|author2=Deufel, Annette|author3=Eisel, Doris|author4=Grünewald-Janho, Stefanie|author5=Keesey, Joe|publisher=Roche Diagnostics|year=2006|edition=3|pages=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(PCR Applications Manual and Biotools)

===Two-step RT-PCR===

Two-step RT-PCR, as the name implies, occurs in two steps. First the reverse transcription and then the PCR. This method is more sensitive than the one-step method. Kits are also useful for two-step RT-PCR. Just as for one-step PCR, use only intact, high quality RNA for the best results. The primer for two-step PCR does not have to be sequence specific.

==== Step one ====
First combine template RNA, primer, dNTP mix, and nuclease-free water in a PCR tube. Then, add an RNase inhibitor and reverse transcriptase to the PCR tube. Next, place the PCR tube into a thermal cycler for one cycle wherein annealing, extending, and inactivating of reverse transcriptase occurs. Finally, proceed directly to step two which is PCR or store product on ice until PCR can be performed.

==== Step two ====
Add master mix which contains buffer, dNTP mix, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Taq polymerase and nuclease-free water to each PCR tube. Then add the necessary primer to the tubes. Next, place the PCR tubes in a thermal cycler for 30 cycles of the amplification program. This includes: denaturation, annealing, and elongation. The products of RT-PCR can be analyzed with gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RT-PCR Two-Step Protocol|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-16-experimental-molecular-biology-biotechnology-ii-spring-2005/labs/rt_pcr_2step.pdf|publisher=MIT|access-date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication guidelines ==

Quantitative  RT-PCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for measuring the number of copies of specific cDNA targets in a sample but it is poorly standardized.&lt;ref name="urlwww.microarrays.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microarrays.ca/about/reviews/Bustin_Review_July2009.pdf |title=www.microarrays.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, while there are numerous publications utilizing the technique, many provide inadequate experimental detail and use unsuitable data analysis to draw inappropriate conclusions. Due to the inherent variability in the quality of any quantitative PCR data, not only do reviewers have a difficult time evaluating these manuscripts, but the studies also become impossible to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bustin SA |title=Why the need for qPCR publication guidelines?--The case for MIQE |journal=Methods |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=217–26 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20025972 |doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2009.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the need for the standardization of the reporting of experimental conditions, the [[Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments]] (MIQE, pronounced mykee) guidelines have been published by an international consortium of academic scientists. The MIQE guidelines describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating [[quantitative PCR]] experiments that should be required for publication for encouraging better experimental practice and ensuring the relevance, accuracy, correct interpretation, and repeatability of quantitative PCR data.&lt;ref name="Bustin et al"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bustin SA, Benes V, Garson JA, etal |title=The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=611–22 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19246619 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides reporting guidelines, the MIQE stresses the need to standardize the nomenclature associated with quantitative PCR to avoid confusion; for example, the abbreviation ''qPCR'' should be used for [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative real-time PCR]], while ''RT-qPCR'' should be used for reverse transcription-qPCR, and genes used for normalisation should be referred to as ''reference genes'' instead of ''[[housekeeping gene]]s''. It also proposes that commercially derived terms like ''TaqMan probes'' should not be used, but instead referred to as ''[[hydrolysis probes]]''. Additionally, it is proposed that quantification cycle (Cq) be used to describe the PCR cycle used for quantification instead of threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and takeoff point (TOP), which refer to the same value but were coined by different manufacturers of [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time instruments]].&lt;ref name="urlwww.microarrays.ca"/&gt;

The guideline consists of the following elements: 1) experimental design, 2) sample, 3) nucleic acid extraction, 4) reverse transcription, 5) qPCR target information, 6) oligonucleotides, 7) protocol, 8) validation, and 9) data analysis. Specific items within each element carry a label of either E (essential) or D (desirable). Those labelled E are considered critical and indispensable while those labelled D are considered peripheral yet important for best-practices.&lt;ref name="Bustin et al"/&gt;

In a flowing [[stream]], this behavior leads them to hold their position rather than being swept downstream by the current. Rheotaxis has been noted in [[zebrafish]] and other species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A novel mechanism for mechanosensory-based rheotaxis in larval zebrafish|first1=Pablo |last1=Oteiza|first2= Iris |last2=Odstrcil|first3= George |last3=Lauder|first4=Ruben |last4=Portugues |first5= Florian|last5= Engert|journal=Nature|volume=547|issue=7664 |pages=445–448|pmid=28700578 |pmc=5873946 |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/nature23014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is found in most major [[aquatic invertebrate]] groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Rheotaxis is important for animal survival because the positioning of an animal in the water can increase its chance of accessing food and lower the amount of energy it spends, especially when it remains stationary.&lt;ref name=Elder2015 /&gt; Some organisms such as eels will exhibit '''negative rheotaxis''' where they will turn away from and avoid oncoming currents.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Swimming activity and behaviour of European Anguilla anguilla glass eels in response to photoperiod and flow reversal and the role of energy status.|last1=Du Colombier |first1=SB|last2= Bolliet |first2=V|last3= Bardonnet |first3=A|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|volume=74|issue=9|pages=2002–13 |pmid=20735685|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02269.x|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This action is a part of their tendency to want to migrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some [[zooplankton]] also exhibit positive or negative rheotaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Holzner|first1=Markus|last2=Souissi|first2=Sami|last3=Fouxon|first3=Itzhak|last4=Michalec|first4=François-Gaël|date=2017-12-26|title=Zooplankton can actively adjust their motility to turbulent flow|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=114|issue=52|pages=E11199–E11207|doi=10.1073/pnas.1708888114|issn=1091-6490|pmc=5748176|pmid=29229858|bibcode=2017PNAS..11411199M |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ribosomal RNA''' ('''rRNA''') '''intergenic spacer analysis''' ('''RISA''') is a method of [[microbial community]] analysis that provides a means of comparing differing environments or treatment impacts without the bias imposed by culture- dependent approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigler|first1=W.V. |first2= J. |last2=Zeyer|date=2002|title=Microbial diversity and activity along the forefields of two receding glaciers |journal=Microb. Ecol. |volume=43|issue=4 |pages=397–407|doi=10.1007/s00248-001-0045-5 |pmid=11953808 |s2cid=1095559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RISA involves [[PCR]] amplification of a region of the [[rRNA]] gene operon between the small ([[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]]) and large ([[23S]]) subunits called the [[intergenic spacer|intergenic spacer region]] ISR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borneman|first1= J. |first2=E.W. |last2=Triplett|date=1997|title=Molecular microbial diversity in soils from eastern Amazonia: evidence for unusual microorganisms and microbial population shifts associated with deforestation. |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=63|issue= 7 |pages=2647–2653|doi= 10.1128/AEM.63.7.2647-2653.1997 |pmid= 9212415 |pmc= 168563 |bibcode= 1997ApEnM..63.2647B |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using [[Oligonucleotide|oligonucleotide primers]] targeted to conserved regions in the 16S and 23S genes, RISA fragments can be generated from most of the dominant [[bacteria]] in an environmental sample. While the majority of the rRNA operon serves a structural function, portions of the 16S-23S intergenic region can encode [[Transfer RNA|tRNAs]] depending on the bacterial species. However the taxonomic value of the ISR lies in the significant heterogeneity in both length and nucleotide sequence. In RISA, we attempt to exploit the length heterogeneity of the ISR, which has been shown to range between 150 and 1500 bp with the majority of the ISR lengths being between 150 and 500 bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigler|first1=W.V.|first2=S|last2=Crivii|first3=J|last3=Zeyer|date=2002|title=Bacterial succession in glacial forefield soils characterized by community structure, activity and opportunistic growth dynamics|journal=Microb.

The resulting PCR product will be a mixture of fragments contributed by several dominant community members. This product is electrophoresed in a [[polyacrylamide gel]], and the DNA is visualized following staining. The result is a complex banding pattern that provides a community-specific profile, with each DNA band corresponding to a bacterial population on the original assemblage.

[[File:Inocybe rimosa WF6 (2).jpg|alt=Rimose mushroom|thumb|Rimose mushroom (''Inosperma rimosum'')|150x150px]]
'''''Rimose''''' is an [[adjective]] used to describe a surface that is cracked or fissured.&lt;ref name="AGBGLG"&gt;[http://www.anbg.gov.au/glossary/webpubl/lichglos.htm Lichen Glossary, Australian Botanic Garden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206070827/http://www.anbg.gov.au/glossary/webpubl/lichglos.htm |date=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is often used in describing [[crustose lichen|crustose]] [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref name="AGBGLG" /&gt; A rimose surface of a lichen is sometimes contrasted to the surface being [[areolate lichen|areolate]].&lt;ref name="AGBGLG" /&gt; Areolate is an extreme form of being rimose, where the cracks or fissures are so deep that they create island-like pieces called [[areoles]], which look the "islands" of mud on the surface of a [[dry lake bed]].&lt;ref name="AGBGLG" /&gt; Rimose and areolate are contrasted with being [[verrucose]], or "warty".&lt;ref name="AGBGLG" /&gt; Verrucose surfaces have warty bumps which are distinct, but not separated by cracks.&lt;ref name="AGBGLG" /&gt;

'''RNA therapeutics''' are a new class of [[medication]]s based on [[RNA|ribonucleic acid (RNA)]]. Research has been working on [[clinical use]] since the 1990s, with significant success in [[cancer therapy]] in the early 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=mRNA-based therapeutics – developing a new class of drugs|year=2014|pmid=25233993|last1=Sahin|first1=U.|last2=Karikó|first2=K.|last3=Türeci|first3=Ö.|journal=Nature Reviews.

The main types of RNA therapeutics are those based on [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), [[antisense RNA]] (asRNA), [[RNA interference]] (RNAi), and RNA [[aptamer]]s. Of the four types, mRNA-based therapy is the only type which is based on triggering [[Protein biosynthesis|synthesis of proteins]] within cells, making it particularly useful in vaccine development.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DeFrancesco L | title = The 'anti-hype' vaccine | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–197 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28244993 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3812 | s2cid = 3606308 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisense RNA is complementary to coding mRNA and is used to trigger mRNA inactivation to prevent the mRNA from being used in protein translation.&lt;ref name="Iida_2008" /&gt; RNAi-based systems use a similar mechanism, and involve the use of both [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) and [[MicroRNA|micro RNA]] (miRNA) to prevent mRNA translation.&lt;ref name="Nikam_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartel_2009" /&gt; However, RNA aptamers are short, single stranded RNA molecules produced by [[directed evolution]] to bind to a variety of biomolecular targets with high affinity thereby affecting their normal ''in vivo'' activity.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaur_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

RNA is synthesized from template DNA by RNA polymerase with [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) serving as the intermediary biomolecule between [[DNA]] expression and [[Translation (biology)|protein translation]]. Because of its unique properties (such as its typically single-stranded nature and its 2' OH group) and its ability to adopt many different secondary/tertiary structures, both coding and noncoding RNAs have attracted attention in medicine. Research has begun to explore RNAs potential to be used for therapeutic benefit, and unique challenges have occurred during drug discovery and implementation of RNA therapeutics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pmid = 31342441  | vauthors = Coutinho MF, Matos L, Santos JI, Alves S   |date=2019 | title = The mRNA Metabolism in Human Disease| journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |volume=1157|pages=133–177| veditors = Romão L |place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-19966-1_7|isbn=978-3-030-19965-4 | s2cid = 198491788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== mRNA ==
Messenger RNA ([[mRNA]]) is a single-stranded [[RNA]] molecule that is complementary to one of the [[DNA]] strands of a [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Messenger RNA (mRNA)|url=https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/messenger-rna|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Genome.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; An mRNA molecule transfers a portion of the DNA code to other parts of the cell for making proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2016-11-25|title=mRNA|url=https://biologydictionary.net/mrna/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Biology Dictionary|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA therapeutics needs access to the nucleus to be transcribed into RNA, and its functionality depends on nuclear envelope breakdown during cell division. However, mRNA therapeutics do not need to enter into the nucleus to be functional since it will be translated immediately once it has reached to the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Herndon MK, Quirk CC, Nilson JH | chapter = Chapter 2 - Control of Hormone Gene Expression|date= January 2016 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-323-18907-1.00002-0 |title =Endocrinology: Adult and Pediatric | edition= Seventh |pages=16–29.e2| veditors = Jameson JL, De Groot LJ, de Kretser DM, Giudice LC |place=Philadelphia|publisher=W.B.

=== Discovery and development ===
In 1953, [[Alfred Hershey|Alfred Day Hershey]] reported that soon after infection with [[Bacteriophage|phage]], bacteria produced a form of RNA at a high level and this RNA was also broken down rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershey AD | title = Nucleic acid economy in bacteria infected with bacteriophage T2 | journal = The Journal of General Physiology | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–23 | date = September 1953 | pmid = 13084888 | doi = 10.1085/jgp.37.1.1 | pmc = 2147426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first clear indication of mRNA was from the work of Elliot Volkin and Lazarus Astrachan in 1956 by infecting [[''Escherichia coli''|''E.coli'']] with [[Enterobacteria phage T2|T2 bacteriophages]] and putting them into the medium with [[Phosphorus-32|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Elliot Volkin Obituary (2012) Knoxville News Sentinel|url=https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/knoxnews/name/elliot-volkin-obituary?pid=155312935|access-date=2021-07-01|website=Legacy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|date=2003-08-02|title=Lazarus Astrachan, 78, Conducted RNA Studies|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/02/us/lazarus-astrachan-78-conducted-rna-studies.html|access-date=2021-07-01|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found out that the protein synthesis of ''E.coli'' was stopped and phage proteins were synthesized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Astrachan L, Colowick CP, Kaplan NO |date= April 1956 |title=Phosphorus incorporation in ''Escherichia coli'' ribonucleic acid after infection with bacteriophage T2 |journal=Virology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=149–161|doi=10.1016/0042-6822(56)90016-2 |pmid= 13312220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in May 1961, their collaborated researchers Sydney Brenner, François Jacob, and Jim Watson announced the isolation of mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner S, Jacob F, Meselson M | title = An unstable intermediate carrying information from genes to ribosomes for protein synthesis | journal = Nature | volume = 190 | issue = 4776 | pages = 576–581 | date = May 1961 | pmid = 20446365 | doi = 10.1038/190576a0 | bibcode = 1961Natur.190..576B | s2cid = 4200865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gros F, Hiatt H, Gilbert W, Kurland CG, Risebrough RW, Watson JD|author6-link=James D.

However, in 1990, Jon A. Wolff demonstrated the idea of nucleic acid-encoded drugs by direct injecting in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA or plasmid DNA (pDNA) into the skeletal muscle of mice which expressed the encoded protein in the injected muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JA, Malone RW, Williams P, Chong W, Acsadi G, Jani A, Felgner PL | title = Direct gene transfer into mouse muscle in vivo | journal = Science | volume = 247 | issue = 4949 Pt 1 | pages = 1465–8 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 1690918 | doi = 10.1126/science.1690918 | bibcode = 1990Sci...247.1465W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sahin U, Karikó K, Türeci Ö | title = mRNA-based therapeutics--developing a new class of drugs | journal = Nature Reviews.

Once IVT mRNA has reached the cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated instantly. Thus, it does not need to enter the nucleus to be functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karikó K | title = In vitro-Transcribed mRNA Therapeutics: Out of the Shadows and Into the Spotlight | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 691–692 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30905578 | pmc = 6453554 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.03.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it does not integrate into the genome and therefore does not have the risk of insertional mutagenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandl CW, Aberle JH, Aberle SW, Holzmann H, Allison SL, Heinz FX | title = In vitro-synthesized infectious RNA as an attenuated live vaccine in a flavivirus model | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 12 | pages = 1438–40 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9846585 | doi = 10.1038/4031 | s2cid = 22676794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, IVT mRNA is only transiently active and is completely degraded via physiological metabolic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoerr I, Obst R, Rammensee HG, Jung G | title = In vivo application of RNA leads to induction of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and antibodies | journal = European Journal of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10602021 | doi = 10.1002/1521-4141(200001)30:1&lt;1::aid-immu1&gt;3.0.co;2-# | s2cid = 196606232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these reasons, IVT mRNA has undergone extensive preclinical investigation.

=== Mechanisms ===
In vitro transcription (IVT) is performed on a linearized DNA plasmid template containing the targeted coding sequence. Then, naked mRNA or mRNA complexed in a nanoparticle will be delivered systemically or locally. Subsequently, a part of the exogenous naked mRNA or complexed mRNA will go through cell-specific mechanisms. Once in the cytoplasm, the IVT mRNA is translated by the protein synthesis machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Hoecke L, Roose K | title = How mRNA therapeutics are entering the monoclonal antibody field | journal = Journal of Translational Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 54 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 30795778 | pmc = 6387507 | doi = 10.1186/s12967-019-1804-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang C, Maruggi G, Shan H, Li J | title = Advances in mRNA Vaccines for Infectious Diseases | language = en | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 10 | pages = 594 | date = 2019 | pmid = 30972078 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594 | pmc = 6446947 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two identified RNA sensors, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the RIG-I-like receptor family. TLRs are localized in the endosomal compartment of cells, such as DCs and macrophages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hua Z, Hou B | title = TLR signaling in B-cell development and activation | journal = Cellular &amp; Molecular Immunology | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–6 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23241902 | doi = 10.1038/cmi.2012.61 | pmc = 4003046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RIG-I-like family is as a [[pattern recognition receptor]] (PRR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kato H, Oh SW, Fujita T | title = RIG-I-Like Receptors and Type I Interferonopathies | journal = Journal of Interferon &amp; Cytokine Research | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 207–213 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28475461 | pmc = 5439449 | doi = 10.1089/jir.2016.0095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the immune response mechanisms and process of mRNA vaccine recognition by cellular sensors and the mechanism of sensor activation are still unclear.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

In 1995, Robert Conry demonstrated that [[intramuscular injection]] of naked RNA encoding [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] elicited antigen-specific antibody responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conry RM, LoBuglio AF, Wright M, Sumerel L, Pike MJ, Johanning F, Benjamin R, Lu D, Curiel DT | display-authors = 6 | title = Characterization of a messenger RNA polynucleotide vaccine vector | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 55 | issue = 7 | pages = 1397–400 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7882341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, it was elaborated by demonstrating that [[dendritic cell]]s(DCs) exposed to mRNA coding for specific antigens or to total mRNA extracted from tumor cells and injected into tumor-bearing mice induced T cell immune responses and inhibited the growth of tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boczkowski D, Nair SK, Snyder D, Gilboa E | title = Dendritic cells pulsed with RNA are potent antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 184 | issue = 2 | pages = 465–72 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8760800 | doi = 10.1084/jem.184.2.465 | pmc = 2192710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, researchers started to approach mRNA transfected DCs using vaccines based on [[ex vivo]] IVT mRNA-transfected DCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nair SK, Heiser A, Boczkowski D, Majumdar A, Naoe M, Lebkowski JS, Vieweg J, Gilboa E | display-authors = 6 | title = Induction of cytotoxic T cell responses and tumor immunity against unrelated tumors using telomerase reverse transcriptase RNA transfected dendritic cells | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 1011–7 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10973321 | doi = 10.1038/79519 | s2cid = 6109427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Argos Therapeutics had initiated a Phase III clinical trial using DCs with advanced [[renal cell carcinoma]] in 2015 (NCT01582672) but it was terminated due to the lack of efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Argos Therapeutics|date=2018-06-13|title=An International Phase 3 Randomized Trial of Autologous Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy (AGS-003) Plus Standard Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (ADAPT)|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01582672 |website=ClinicalTrials |access-date=30 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For further application, IVT mRNA was optimized for [[in situ]] transfections of DCs [[in vivo]]. It improved the translation efficiency and stability of IVT mRNA and enhanced the presentation of the mRNA-encoded antigen on [[MHC class I]] and [[MHC class II|II]] molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kreiter S, Konrad T, Sester M, Huber C, Türeci O, Sahin U | title = Simultaneous ex vivo quantification of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses using in vitro transcribed RNA | journal = Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy | volume = 56 | issue = 10 | pages = 1577–87 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17361438 | doi = 10.1007/s00262-007-0302-7 | s2cid = 23374448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kreiter S, Selmi A, Diken M, Sebastian M, Osterloh P, Schild H, Huber C, Türeci O, Sahin U | display-authors = 6 | title = Increased antigen presentation efficiency by coupling antigens to MHC class I trafficking signals | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 180 | issue = 1 | pages = 309–18 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18097032 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.180.1.309 | s2cid = 83698413 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, they found out that the direct injection of naked IVT mRNA into lymph nodes was the most effective way to induce [[T cell]] responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn AN, Diken M, Kreiter S, Selmi A, Kowalska J, Jemielity J, Darzynkiewicz E, Huber C, Türeci O, Sahin U | display-authors = 6 | title = Phosphorothioate cap analogs increase stability and translational efficiency of RNA vaccines in immature dendritic cells and induce superior immune responses in vivo | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 961–71 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20410931 | doi = 10.1038/gt.2010.52 | s2cid = 647837 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this discovery, first-in-human testing of the injection of naked IVT mRNA encoding cancer antigens by [[BioNTech]] has started with patients with melanoma (NCT01684241).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals GmbH|date=2020-01-14|title=Clinical First-in-human Dose Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of Intranodal Administration of an RNA-based Cancer Vaccine Targeting Two Tumor-associated Antigens in Patients With Advanced Melanoma|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01684241 |website=ClinicalTrials |access-date=30 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the new cancer immunotherapy, the combining of self-delivering RNA(sd-rxRNA) and [[adoptive cell transfer]](ACT) therapy, was invented by [[RXi Pharmaceuticals]] and the [[Karolinska Institute]]. In this therapy, the sd-rxRNA eliminated the expression of immunosuppressive receptors and proteins in therapeutic immune cells so it improved the ability of immune cells to destroy the tumor cells. Then, the [[Programmed cell death protein 1|PD-1]] targeted sd-rxRNA helped increasing the anti-tumor activity of [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes]] (TIL) against melanoma cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ligtenberg MA, Pico de Coaña Y, Shmushkovich T, Yoshimoto Y, Truxova I, Yang Y, Betancur-Boissel M, Eliseev AV, Wolfson AD, Kiessling R | display-authors = 6 | title = Self-Delivering RNAi Targeting PD-1 Improves Tumor-Specific T Cell Functionality for Adoptive Cell Therapy of Malignant Melanoma | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 1482–1493 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29735366 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.04.015 | pmc = 5986970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lian S, Xie R, Ye Y, Xie X, Li S, Lu Y, Li B, Cheng Y, Katanaev VL, Jia L | display-authors = 6 | title = Simultaneous blocking of CD47 and PD-L1 increases innate and adaptive cancer immune responses and cytokine release | journal = EBioMedicine | volume = 42 | pages = 281–295 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30878596 | doi = 10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.03.018 | pmc = 6491392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this idea, the mRNA-4157 has been tested and passed phase I clinical trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mRNA-4157 {{!}} Moderna, Inc.|url=https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline/mrna-4157|access-date=2020-11-30|website=www.modernatx.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cytosol]]ic nucleic acid-sensing pathways can enhance immune response to cancer. [[RIG-I]] agonist, stem loop RNA (SLR) 14. Tumor growth was significantly delayed and extended survival in mice. SLR14 improved antitumor efficacy of anti-[[PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors|PD1 antibody]] over single-agent treatment. SLR14 was absorbed by [[Integrin alpha M|CD11b+]] [[myeloid cells]] in the [[tumor microenvironment]]. Genes associated with immune defense were significantly up-regulated, along with increased [[CD8+]] [[T lymphocytes]], [[Natural killer cell|NK cells]], and CD11b+ cells. SLR14 inhibited nonimmunogenic [[B16 Melanoma|B16]] tumor growth, leaving immune memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Xiaodong|last2=Muthusamy|first2=Viswanathan|last3=Fedorova|first3=Olga|last4=Kong|first4=Yong|last5=Kim|first5=Daniel J.|last6=Bosenberg|first6=Marcus|last7=Pyle|first7=Anna Marie|last8=Iwasaki|first8=Akiko|date=2019-12-02|title=Intratumoral delivery of RIG-I agonist SLR14 induces robust antitumor responses|journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine|volume=216|issue=12|pages=2854–2868|doi=10.1084/jem.20190801|issn=1540-9538|pmc=6888973|pmid=31601678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vaccines ====
{{Main|RNA vaccine}}
In 1993, the first success of an [[mRNA vaccine]] was reported in [[mice]], by using [[liposome]]-encapsulated IVT mRNA which is encoding the [[nucleoprotein]] of influenza that induced virus-specific T cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinon F, Krishnan S, Lenzen G, Magné R, Gomard E, Guillet JG, Lévy JP, Meulien P | display-authors = 6 | title = Induction of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo by liposome-entrapped mRNA | journal = European Journal of Immunology | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 1719–22 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8325342 | doi = 10.1002/eji.1830230749 | s2cid = 42640967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, IVT mRNA was formulated with synthetic lipid nanoparticles and it induced protective antibody responses against the [[respiratory syncytial virus]](RSV) and [[influenza virus]] in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hekele A, Bertholet S, Archer J, Gibson DG, Palladino G, Brito LA, Otten GR, Brazzoli M, Buccato S, Bonci A, Casini D, Maione D, Qi ZQ, Gill JE, Caiazza NC, Urano J, Hubby B, Gao GF, Shu Y, De Gregorio E, Mandl CW, Mason PW, Settembre EC, Ulmer JB, Craig Venter J, Dormitzer PR, Rappuoli R, Geall AJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Rapidly produced SAM(®) vaccine against H7N9 influenza is immunogenic in mice | journal = Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = e52 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 26038486 | pmc = 3821287 | doi = 10.1038/emi.2013.54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few different types of IVT mRNA-based vaccine development for infectious diseases. One of the successful types is using self-amplifying IVT mRNA that has sequences of positive-stranded RNA viruses. It was originally developed for a [[flavivirus]] and it was workable with [[Intradermal injection|intradermal]] injection. One of the other ways is injecting a two-component vaccine which is containing an mRNA [[adjuvant]] and naked IVT mRNA encoding influenza [[hemagglutinin]] antigen only or in combination with [[neuraminidase]] encoding IVT mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petsch B, Schnee M, Vogel AB, Lange E, Hoffmann B, Voss D, Schlake T, Thess A, Kallen KJ, Stitz L, Kramps T | display-authors = 6 | title = Protective efficacy of in vitro synthesized, specific mRNA vaccines against influenza A virus infection | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1210–6 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23159882 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2436 | s2cid = 12488462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for the HIV treatment, vaccines are using DCs transfected with IVT mRNA that is encoding HIV proteins. There are a few phase I and II clinical trials using IVT mRNA encoding combinations and it shows that antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses can be induced. However, no antiviral effects have been observed in the clinical trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Routy JP, Boulassel MR, Yassine-Diab B, Nicolette C, Healey D, Jain R, Landry C, Yegorov O, Tcherepanova I, Monesmith T, Finke L, Sékaly RP | display-authors = 6 | title = Immunologic activity and safety of autologous HIV RNA-electroporated dendritic cells in HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy | journal = Clinical Immunology | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19889582 | doi = 10.1016/j.clim.2009.09.009 | pmc = 2818410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Gulck E, Vlieghe E, Vekemans M, Van Tendeloo VF, Van De Velde A, Smits E, Anguille S, Cools N, Goossens H, Mertens L, De Haes W, Wong J, Florence E, Vanham G, Berneman ZN | display-authors = 6 | title = mRNA-based dendritic cell vaccination induces potent antiviral T-cell responses in HIV-1-infected patients | journal = AIDS | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = F1-12 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22156965 | doi = 10.1097/qad.0b013e32834f33e8 | s2cid = 205988884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the other [[COVID-19 vaccine|mRNA vaccines is for COVID-19]]. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 ([[Coronavirus disease 2019|SARS-CoV-2]]) outbreaks in December 2019 and spread all over the world, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Helmy YA, Fawzy M, Elaswad A, Sobieh A, Kenney SP, Shehata AA | title = The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comprehensive Review of Taxonomy, Genetics, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Control | journal = Journal of Clinical Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 1225 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32344679 | doi = 10.3390/jcm9041225 | pmc = 7230578 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Moderna COVID-19 vaccine]], manufactured by [[Moderna]] since 2020, is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike(S)-2P antigen of SARS-CoV-2 with a [[Transmembrane protein|transmembrane]] anchor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug|url=https://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/life-with-pf/clinical-trials/pipeline/drug/covid-19/mrna-1273|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Default}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson LA, Anderson EJ, Rouphael NG, Roberts PC, Makhene M, Coler RN, McCullough MP, Chappell JD, Denison MR, Stevens LJ, Pruijssers AJ, McDermott A, Flach B, Doria-Rose NA, Corbett KS, Morabito KM, O'Dell S, Schmidt SD, Swanson PA, Padilla M, Mascola JR, Neuzil KM, Bennett H, Sun W, Peters E, Makowski M, Albert J, Cross K, Buchanan W, Pikaart-Tautges R, Ledgerwood JE, Graham BS, Beigel JH | display-authors = 6 | title = An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 - Preliminary Report | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 383 | issue = 20 | pages = 1920–1931 | date = November 2020 | pmid = 32663912 | pmc = 7377258 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa2022483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anti-viral ====
In 2021, SLR14 was reported to prevent infection in the lower [[respiratory tract]] and severe disease in an [[interferon type I]] (IFN-I)–dependent manner in mice. [[Immunodeficiency|Immunodeficient]] mice with chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced near-sterilizing innate immunity with no help from the [[adaptive immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mao|first1=Tianyang|last2=Israelow|first2=Benjamin|last3=Lucas|first3=Carolina|last4=Vogels|first4=Chantal B.F.|last5=Gomez-Calvo|first5=Maria Luisa|last6=Fedorova|first6=Olga|last7=Breban|first7=Mallery I.|last8=Menasche|first8=Bridget L.|last9=Dong|first9=Huiping|last10=Linehan|first10=Melissa|last11=Yale SARS-CoV-2 Genome Surveillance Initiative|date=2021-11-10|title=A stem-loop RNA RIG-I agonist protects against acute and chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice|url=https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20211818|journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine|volume=219|issue=1|pages=e20211818|doi=10.1084/jem.20211818|pmid=34757384|pmc=8590200|issn=0022-1007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tissue regeneration ====
A 2022 study by researchers from the [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Maastricht University]], and Ethris GmBH, a biotech company that focuses on RNA therapeutics, found that [[chemically modified mRNA]] encoding BMP-2 promoted dosage-dependent healing of [[Femur|femoral]] [[Osteotomy|osteotomies]] in male rats. The mRNA molecules were complexed within nonviral [[Lipid nanoparticles|lipid particles]], loaded onto sponges, and surgically implanted into the bone defects. They remained localized around the site of application. Compared to receiving rhBMP-2 directly, bony tissues regenerated after mRNA treatment displayed superior strength and less formation of massive callus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=De La Vega |first1=Rodolfo E. |last2=van Griensven |first2=Martijn |last3=Zhang |first3=Wen |last4=Coenen |first4=Michael J. |last5=Nagelli |first5=Christopher V. |last6=Panos |first6=Joseph A. |last7=Peniche Silva |first7=Carlos J. |last8=Geiger |first8=Johannes |last9=Plank |first9=Christian |last10=Evans |first10=Christopher H. |last11=Balmayor |first11=Elizabeth R. |date=2022-02-18 |title=Efficient healing of large osseous segmental defects using optimized chemically modified messenger RNA encoding BMP-2 |journal=Science Advances |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=eabl6242 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.abl6242 |issn=2375-2548 |pmc=8849297 |pmid=35171668|bibcode=2022SciA....8.6242D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
There are many challenges for the successful translation of mRNA into drugs because mRNA is a very large and heavy molecule(10^5 ~ 10^6 Da). Moreover, mRNA is unstable and easily degraded by nucleases, and it also activates the immune systems.&lt;ref name = "Houseley_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Houseley J, Tollervey D | title = The many pathways of RNA degradation | journal = Cell | volume = 136 | issue = 4 | pages = 763–76 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19239894 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.019 | s2cid = 17570967 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, mRNA has a high negative charge density and it reduces the permeation of mRNA across cellular membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kowalski PS, Rudra A, Miao L, Anderson DG | title = Delivering the Messenger: Advances in Technologies for Therapeutic mRNA Delivery | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 710–728 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30846391 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.02.012 | pmc = 6453548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these reasons, without the appropriate delivery system, mRNA is degraded easily and the half-life of mRNA without a delivery system is only around 7 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharova LV, Sharov AA, Nedorezov T, Piao Y, Shaik N, Ko MS | title = Database for mRNA half-life of 19 977 genes obtained by DNA microarray analysis of pluripotent and differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = DNA Research | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–58 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19001483 | doi = 10.1093/dnares/dsn030 | pmc = 2644350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though some degrees of challenges could be overcome by [[Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA|chemical modifications]], delivery of mRNA remains an obstacle. The methods that have been researched to improve the delivery system of mRNA are using [[microinjection]], RNA patches (mRNA loaded in a dissolving micro-needle), [[gene gun]], [[protamine]] condensation, RNA [[adjuvant]]s, and encapsulating mRNA in nanoparticles with lipids.&lt;ref name = "Houseley_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deering RP, Kommareddy S, Ulmer JB, Brito LA, Geall AJ | title = Nucleic acid vaccines: prospects for non-viral delivery of mRNA vaccines | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 885–99 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24665982 | doi = 10.1517/17425247.2014.901308 | s2cid = 33489182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Golombek S, Pilz M, Steinle H, Kochba E, Levin Y, Lunter D, Schlensak C, Wendel HP, Avci-Adali M | display-authors = 6 | title = Intradermal Delivery of Synthetic mRNA Using Hollow Microneedles for Efficient and Rapid Production of Exogenous Proteins in Skin | journal = Molecular Therapy: Nucleic Acids | volume = 11 | pages = 382–392 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29858073 | doi = 10.1016/j.omtn.2018.03.005 | pmc = 5992458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though In Vitro Translated (IVT) mRNA with delivery agents showed improved resistance against degradation, it needs more studies on how to improve the efficiency of the delivery of naked mRNA [[in vivo]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

== Antisense RNA ==

[[Antisense RNA]] is the non-coding and single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a coding sequence of mRNA. It inhibits the ability of mRNA to be translated into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2017-06-06|title=7.19A: RNA Regulation and Antisense RNA|url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Book%3A_Microbiology_(Boundless)/7%3A_Microbial_Genetics/7.19%3A_RNA-Based_Regulation/7.19A%3A_RNA_Regulation_and_Antisense_RNA|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Biology LibreTexts|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short antisense RNA transcripts are produced within the nucleus by the action of the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves double-stranded RNA precursors into 21–26 nucleotide long RNA species.&lt;ref name="Iida_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iida T, Nakayama J, Moazed D | title = siRNA-mediated heterochromatin establishment requires HP1 and is associated with antisense transcription | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–89 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18657501 | pmc = 2575423 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2008.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an antisense-based discovery strategy, rationale and design of screening assays, and the application of such assays for screening of natural product extracts and the discovery of [[fatty acid]] condensing enzyme inhibitors.&lt;ref name="pmid17436551"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh SB, Phillips JW, Wang J | title = Highly sensitive target-based whole-cell antibacterial discovery strategy by antisense RNA silencing | journal = Current Opinion in Drug Discovery &amp; Development | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–6 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17436551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisense RNA is used for treating cancer and inhibition of [[metastasis]] and vectors for antisense sequestration.

Non-viral vectors, virus vectors and liposomes have been used to deliver the antisense RNA through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm and nucleus.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} It has been found that the viral vector based delivery is the most advantageous among different delivery systems because it has a high transfection efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farooqi AA, Rehman ZU, Muntane J | title = Antisense therapeutics in oncology: current status | journal = OncoTargets and Therapy | volume = 7 | pages = 2035–42 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25395862 | doi = 10.2147/ott.s49652 | pmc = 4224095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult to deliver antisense RNA only to the targeted sites.

=== Discovery and development ===
Aptamers were originally discovered in 1990 when Lary Gold and Craig Tuerk utilized a method of directed evolution known as [[Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment|SELEX]] to isolate a small single stranded RNA molecule that was capable of binding to T4 bacteriophage DNA polymerase.&lt;ref name="Kaur_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuerk C, Gold L | title = Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4968 | pages = 505–10 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2200121 | doi = 10.1126/science.2200121 | bibcode = 1990Sci...249..505T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the term “aptamer” was coined by Andrew Ellington, who worked with Jack Szostak to select an RNA aptamer that was capable of tight binding to certain organic dye molecules.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellington AD, Szostak JW | title = In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands | journal = Nature | volume = 346 | issue = 6287 | pages = 818–22 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 1697402 | doi = 10.1038/346818a0 | bibcode = 1990Natur.346..818E | s2cid = 4273647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself is a conglomeration of the Latin “aptus” or “to fit” and the Greek “meros” or “part."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

RNA aptamers are not so much “created” as “selected.” To develop an RNA aptamer capable of selective binding to a molecular target, a method known as [[Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment|Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment]] (SELEX) is used to isolate a unique RNA aptamer from a pool of ~10^13 to 10^16 different aptamers, otherwise known as a library.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaur_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The library of potential aptamer oligonucleotides is then incubated with a non-target species so as to remove aptamers that exhibit non-specific binding.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt; After subsequent removal of the non-specific aptamers, the remaining library members are then exposed to the desired target, which can be a protein, peptide, cell type, or even an organ (in the case of live animal-based SELEX).&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo KT, Ziemer G, Paul A, Wendel HP | title = CELL-SELEX: Novel perspectives of aptamer-based therapeutics | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 668–78 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 19325777 | pmc = 2635693 | doi = 10.3390/ijms9040668 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Ohuchi S |date=2012|title=Cell-SELEX Technology| journal=BioResearch Open Access|volume=1|issue=6|pages=265–272|doi=10.1089/biores.2012.0253|pmid=23515081|pmc=3559206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Cerchia L, Giangrande PH, McNamara JO, de Franciscis V | title = Nucleic Acid and Peptide Aptamers | chapter = Cell-specific aptamers for targeted therapies | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 535 | pages = 59–78 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19377980 | pmc = 4443708 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-59745-557-2_5 | publisher = Humana Press | isbn = 978-1-59745-557-2 | place = Totowa, NJ | veditors = Mayer G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tang_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang Z, Shangguan D, Wang K, Shi H, Sefah K, Mallikratchy P, Chen HW, Li Y, Tan W | display-authors = 6 | title = Selection of aptamers for molecular recognition and characterization of cancer cells | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 13 | pages = 4900–7 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17530817 | doi = 10.1021/ac070189y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao Z, Shangguan D, Cao Z, Fang X, Tan W | title = Cell-specific internalization study of an aptamer from whole cell selection | journal = Chemistry | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 1769–75 | date = 2008-02-18 | pmid = 18092308 | doi = 10.1002/chem.200701330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips JA, Lopez-Colon D, Zhu Z, Xu Y, Tan W | title = Applications of aptamers in cancer cell biology | journal = Analytica Chimica Acta | volume = 621 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–8 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18573375 | doi = 10.1016/j.aca.2008.05.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the RNA aptamers which were bound to the target are transcribed to [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] which then is amplified through [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], and the PCR products are then re-transcribed to RNA.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These new RNA transcripts are then used to repeat the selection cycle many times, thus eventually producing a homogeneous pool of RNA aptamers capable of highly specific, high-affinity target binding.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt;

For instance, by conjugating the RNA aptamer to a drug compound, the RNA aptamer can act as a targeted delivery system for that drug.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt; Such RNA aptamers are known as ApDCs.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt; Additionally, through conjugation to [[Radionuclide|radioisotope]] or a [[Fluorophore|fluorescent dye]] molecule, RNA aptamers may be useful in diagnostic imaging.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shi H, He X, Wang K, Wu X, Ye X, Guo Q, Tan W, Qing Z, Yang X, Zhou B | display-authors = 6 | title = Activatable aptamer probe for contrast-enhanced in vivo cancer imaging based on cell membrane protein-triggered conformation alteration | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 10 | pages = 3900–5 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21368158 | pmc = 3054025 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1016197108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.3900S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Smaga LP, Satyavolu NS, Chan J, Lu Y | title = DNA Aptamer-Based Activatable Probes for Photoacoustic Imaging in Living Mice | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 139 | issue = 48 | pages = 17225–17228 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29028325 | pmc = 5724028 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.7b07913  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the SELEX process utilized to select RNA aptamers, RNA aptamers can be generated for many potential targets. By directly introducing the RNA aptamers to the target during SELEX, a very selective, high-affinity, homogeneous pool of RNA aptamers can be produced. As such, RNA aptamers can be made to target small peptides and proteins, as well as cell fragments, whole cells, and even specific tissues.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mi J, Liu Y, Rabbani ZN, Yang Z, Urban JH, Sullenger BA, Clary BM | title = In vivo selection of tumor-targeting RNA motifs | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–4 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19946274 | pmc = 2795795 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shangguan D, Li Y, Tang Z, Cao ZC, Chen HW, Mallikaratchy P, Sefah K, Yang CJ, Tan W | display-authors = 6 | title = Aptamers evolved from live cells as effective molecular probes for cancer study | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 32 | pages = 11838–43 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16873550 | pmc = 1567664 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0602615103 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tang_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen HW, Medley CD, Sefah K, Shangguan D, Tang Z, Meng L, Smith JE, Tan W | display-authors = 6 | title = Molecular recognition of small-cell lung cancer cells using aptamers | journal = ChemMedChem | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 991–1001 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18338423 | pmc = 3544301 | doi = 10.1002/cmdc.200800030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of RNA aptamer molecular targets and potential targets include [[vascular endothelial growth factor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gragoudas ES, Adamis AP, Cunningham ET, Feinsod M, Guyer DR | title = Pegaptanib for neovascular age-related macular degeneration | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 27 | pages = 2805–16 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15625332 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042760 | s2cid = 10050130 | url = http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/pegaptanib-for-neovascular-agerelated-macular-degeneration(1a482e79-2a38-4336-85b2-eef4b6e507a9).html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[osteoblast]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang C, Guo B, Wu H, Shao N, Li D, Liu J, Dang L, Wang C, Li H, Li S, Lau WK, Cao Y, Yang Z, Lu C, He X, Au DW, Pan X, Zhang BT, Lu C, Zhang H, Yue K, Qian A, Shang P, Xu J, Xiao L, Bian Z, Tan W, Liang Z, He F, Zhang L, Lu A, Zhang G | display-authors = 6 | title = Aptamer-functionalized lipid nanoparticles targeting osteoblasts as a novel RNA interference-based bone anabolic strategy | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–94 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25665179 | pmc = 5508976 | doi = 10.1038/nm.3791 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and C-X-C Chemokine Ligand 12 ([[Stromal cell-derived factor 1|CXCL2]]).&lt;ref name="Zhu_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaur_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoellenriegel J, Zboralski D, Maasch C, Rosin NY, Wierda WG, Keating MJ, Kruschinski A, Burger JA | display-authors = 6 | title = The Spiegelmer NOX-A12, a novel CXCL12 inhibitor, interferes with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell motility and causes chemosensitization | journal = Blood | volume = 123 | issue = 7 | pages = 1032–9 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24277076 | pmc = 4123413 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2013-03-493924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
While the high-selectivity and tight-binding of RNA aptamers have generated interest in their use as pharmaceuticals, there are many problems which have prevented them from being successful ''in vivo''. For one, without modifications RNA aptamers are degraded after being introduced into the body by [[nuclease]]s in the span of a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Kaur_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Healy_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Healy JM, Lewis SD, Kurz M, Boomer RM, Thompson KM, Wilson C, McCauley TG | title = Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of novel aptamer compositions | journal = Pharmaceutical Research | volume = 21 | issue = 12 | pages = 2234–46 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15648255 | doi = 10.1007/s11095-004-7676-4 | s2cid = 25786376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abeydeera ND, Egli M, Cox N, Mercier K, Conde JN, Pallan PS, Mizurini DM, Sierant M, Hibti FE, Hassell T, Wang T, Liu FW, Liu HM, Martinez C, Sood AK, Lybrand TP, Frydman C, Monteiro RQ, Gomer RH, Nawrot B, Yang X | display-authors = 6 | title = Evoking picomolar binding in RNA by a single phosphorodithioate linkage | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = 17 | pages = 8052–64 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27566147 | pmc = 5041495 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, due to their small size, RNA aptamers can be removed from the bloodstream by the renal system.&lt;ref name="Kaur_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Healy_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Because of their negative charge, RNA aptamers are additionally known to bind proteins in the bloodstream, leading to non-target tissue delivery and toxicity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henry SP, Giclas PC, Leeds J, Pangburn M, Auletta C, Levin AA, Kornbrust DJ | title = Activation of the alternative pathway of complement by a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide: potential mechanism of action | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 281 | issue = 2 | pages = 810–6 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9152389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farman CA, Kornbrust DJ | title = Oligodeoxynucleotide studies in primates: antisense and immune stimulatory indications | journal = Toxicologic Pathology | volume = 31 Suppl | pages = 119–22 | date = 2016-11-17 | pmid = 12597439 | doi = 10.1080/01926230390174995 | s2cid = 22520922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Care must also be taken when isolating the RNA aptamers, as aptamers which contain repeated Cytosine-Phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sequences will cause immune system activation through the [[Toll-like receptor]] pathway.&lt;ref name="Kaur_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Avci-Adali M, Steinle H, Michel T, Schlensak C, Wendel HP | title = Potential capacity of aptamers to trigger immune activation in human blood | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = e68810 | date = 2013-07-23 | pmid = 23935890 | pmc = 3720859 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0068810 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...868810A | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mena A, Nichani AK, Popowych Y, Godson DL, Dent D, Townsend HG, Mutwiri GK, Hecker R, Babiuk LA, Griebel P | display-authors = 6 | title = Innate immune responses induced by CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide stimulation of ovine blood mononuclear cells | journal = Immunology | volume = 110 | issue = 2 | pages = 250–7 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14511239 | pmc = 1783041 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2567.2003.01722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to combat some of the ''in vivo'' limitations of RNA aptamers, [[Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA|various modifications can be added to the nucleotides]] to aid in efficacy of the aptamer.

{{Genetics sidebar}}
'''Ribonucleic acid''' ('''RNA''') is a [[polymer]]ic molecule essential in various biological roles in [[Genetic code|coding]], [[Translation (biology)|decoding]], [[Regulatory RNA|regulation]] and [[Gene expression|expression]] of [[gene]]s. RNA and deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]) are [[nucleic acid]]s. Along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[carbohydrate]]s, nucleic acids constitute one of the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the [[nucleobase|nitrogenous bases]] of [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].

Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the [[ribosome]], where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.

==Comparison with DNA==

&lt;div style="overflow:hidden"&gt;
The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of [[DNA]], but differs in three primary ways:
* Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is usually a single-stranded molecule (ssRNA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/basics/rna/ | title =RNA: The Versatile Molecule | publisher =[[University of Utah]] | year =2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/notes/notes_14C_nucacids.pdf | title=Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids | publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]] | access-date=2015-08-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202511/http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/notes/notes_14C_nucacids.pdf | archive-date=2015-09-23 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[RNA#Double-stranded RNA|double-stranded RNA]] (dsRNA) can form and (moreover) a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in tRNA.
* While the sugar-phosphate "backbone" of DNA contains ''[[deoxyribose]]'', RNA contains ''[[ribose]]'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-UKCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=dna+contains+deoxyribose+rna+ribose&amp;pg=PT386 | title =Analysis of Chromosomes | vauthors = Shukla RN | isbn =978-93-84568-17-7| date =2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ribose has a [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] group attached to the pentose ring in the [[nucleic acid nomenclature|2']] position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically [[Lability|labile]] than DNA by lowering the [[activation energy]] of [[hydrolysis]].
* The complementary base to [[adenine]] in DNA is [[thymine]], whereas in RNA, it is [[uracil]], which is an [[methylation|unmethylated]] form of thymine.&lt;ref name=Biochemistry/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including [[mRNA]], [[tRNA]], [[rRNA]], [[snRNA]]s, and other [[non-coding RNA]]s, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tinoco I, Bustamante C | title = How RNA folds | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 293 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–81 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10550208 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1999.3001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.

In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical [[catalysis]] (like enzymes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Higgs PG | title = RNA secondary structure: physical and computational aspects | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 199–253 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 11191843 | doi = 10.1017/S0033583500003620 | s2cid = 37230785 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, determination of the structure of the ribosome—an RNA-protein complex that catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.&lt;ref name=ribosome_activity&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nissen P, Hansen J, Ban N, Moore PB, Steitz TA | title = The structural basis of ribosome activity in peptide bond synthesis | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5481 | pages = 920–30 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10937990 | doi = 10.1126/science.289.5481.920 | bibcode = 2000Sci...289..920N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piwi-siRNA-basepairing.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Watson-Crick base pairs in a [[siRNA]] (hydrogen atoms are not shown)]]
Each [[nucleotide]] in RNA contains a [[ribose]] sugar, with carbons numbered 1' through 5'. A base is attached to the 1' position, in general, [[adenine]] (A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), or [[uracil]] (U). Adenine and guanine are [[purine]]s, cytosine and uracil are [[pyrimidine]]s. A [[phosphate]] group is attached to the 3' position of one ribose and the 5' position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each, making RNA a charged molecule (polyanion). The bases form [[hydrogen bond]]s between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil.&lt;ref name="pmid15561141"/&gt; However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=RNA biochemistry and biotechnology| vauthors= Barciszewski J, Frederic B, Clark C | date = 1999 | pages = 73–87 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-0-7923-5862-6 | oclc = 52403776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RNA chemical structure.GIF|thumb|left|Structure of a fragment of an RNA, showing a guanosyl subunit.]]
An important structural component of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a [[hydroxyl]] group at the 2' position of the [[Ribose|ribose sugar]].

[[File:Ciliate telomerase RNA.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Secondary structure]] of a [[telomerase RNA]].]]
RNA is transcribed with only four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical gene analysis and manipulation: Tools, techniques and troubleshooting|vauthors=Jankowski JA, Polak JM|date=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/clinicalgeneanal0000unse/page/14 14]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47896-0|oclc=33838261|url=https://archive.org/details/clinicalgeneanal0000unse/page/14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these bases and attached sugars can be modified in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. [[Pseudouridine]] (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and [[5-methyluridine|ribothymidine]] (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of [[tRNA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu Q, Morrow CD | title = Identification of critical elements in the tRNA acceptor stem and T(Psi)C loop necessary for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infectivity | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 75 | issue = 10 | pages = 4902–6 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11312362 | pmc = 114245 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.75.10.4902-4906.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable modified base is [[hypoxanthine]], a deaminated adenine base whose [[nucleoside]] is called [[inosine]] (I). Inosine plays a key role in the [[wobble hypothesis]] of the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott MS, Trewyn RW | title = Inosine biosynthesis in transfer RNA by an enzymatic insertion of hypoxanthine | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 259 | issue = 4 | pages = 2407–10 | date = February 1984 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(17)43367-9 | pmid = 6365911 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is notable that, in ribosomal RNA, many of the post-transcriptional modifications occur in highly functional regions, such as the peptidyl transferase center &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tirumalai MR, Rivas M, Tran Q, Fox GE | title = The Peptidyl Transferase Center: a Window to the Past. | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 85 | issue = 4 | pages = e0010421 | date = November 2021 | pmid = 34756086 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00104-21 | pmc = 8579967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subunit interface, implying that they are important for normal function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = King TH, Liu B, McCully RR, Fournier MJ | title = Ribosome structure and activity are altered in cells lacking snoRNPs that form pseudouridines in the peptidyl transferase center | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 425–35 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12620230 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00040-6 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific [[RNA Tertiary Structure|tertiary structure]]. The scaffold for this structure is provided by [[secondary structure|secondary structural]] elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable "domains" of secondary structure like [[hairpin loop]]s, bulges, and [[internal loop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathews DH, Disney MD, Childs JL, Schroeder SJ, Zuker M, Turner DH | title = Incorporating chemical modification constraints into a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 19 | pages = 7287–92 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15123812 | pmc = 409911 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401799101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.7287M | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order create, i.e., design, a RNA for any given secondary structure, two or three bases would not be enough, but four bases are enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burghardt B, Hartmann AK |

s2cid = 17574854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely why nature has "chosen" a four base alphabet: less than four does not allow to create all structures, while more than four bases are  not necessary. Since RNA is charged, metal ions such as [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] are needed to stabilise many secondary and [[RNA Tertiary Structure|tertiary structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan ZJ, Chen SJ | title = Salt dependence of nucleic acid hairpin stability | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 738–52 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18424500 | pmc = 2440479 | doi = 10.1529/biophysj.108.131524 | bibcode = 2008BpJ....95..738T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturally occurring [[enantiomer]] of RNA is &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-RNA composed of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-ribonucleotides. All chirality centers are located in the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-ribose.

Like other structured [[biopolymer]]s such as proteins, one can define topology of a folded RNA molecule. This is often done based on arrangement of intra-chain contacts within a folded RNA, termed as [[circuit topology]].

==Synthesis==
Synthesis of RNA is usually catalyzed by an enzyme—[[RNA polymerase]]—using DNA as a template, a process known as [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequence in the DNA (usually found "upstream" of a gene). The DNA double helix is unwound by the [[helicase]] activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nudler E, Gottesman ME | title = Transcription termination and anti-termination in E. coli | journal = Genes to Cells | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 755–68 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12167155 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00563.x | s2cid = 23191624 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary transcript]] RNAs are often [[Post-transcriptional modification|modified]] by enzymes after transcription. For example, a [[poly(A) tail]] and a [[5' cap]] are added to eukaryotic [[pre-mRNA]] and [[intron]]s are removed by the [[spliceosome]].

There are also a number of [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]]s that use RNA as their template for synthesis of a new strand of RNA. For instance, a number of [[Orthornavirae|RNA viruses]] (such as poliovirus) use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen JL, Long AM, Schultz SC | title = Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus | journal = Structure | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = 1109–22 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9309225 | doi = 10.1016/S0969-2126(97)00261-X | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is part of the [[RNA interference]] pathway in many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahlquist P | title = RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, viruses, and RNA silencing | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5571 | pages = 1270–73 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12016304 | doi = 10.1126/science.1069132 | bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1270A | s2cid = 42526536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the [[ribosome]], the sites of protein synthesis ([[Translation (biology)|translation]]) in the cell. The mRNA is a copy of DNA.

===In translation===
[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the [[ribosome]]s, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is [[genetic code|coded]] so that every three nucleotides (a [[codon]]) corresponds to one amino acid. In [[eukaryotic]] cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its [[intron]]s—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the [[cytoplasm]], where it is bound to ribosomes and [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into its corresponding protein form with the help of [[tRNA]]. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After a certain amount of time, the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of [[ribonuclease]]s.&lt;ref name=The_Cell/&gt;

[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) is a small RNA chain of about 80 [[nucleotide]]s that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing [[polypeptide]] chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an [[anticodon]] region for [[codon]] recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.&lt;ref name=transcriptome/&gt;

[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) is the catalytic component of the ribosomes. The rRNA is the component of the ribosome that hosts translation. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the [[nucleolus]], and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.&lt;ref name=The_Cell&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|edition=3rd| vauthors = Cooper GC, Hausman RE | date = 2004|pages=261–76, 297, 339–44|publisher=Sinauer|isbn=978-0-87893-214-6|oclc=174924833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.

[[tmRNA|Transfer-messenger RNA]] (tmRNA) is found in many [[bacteria]] and [[plastid]]s. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gueneau de Novoa P, Williams KP | title = The tmRNA website: reductive evolution of tmRNA in plastids and other endosymbionts | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = Database issue | pages = D104–08 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14681369 | pmc = 308836 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulatory RNA ==

The earliest known regulators of [[gene expression]] were proteins known as [[repressor]]s and [[Activator (genetics)|activators]] – regulators with specific short binding sites within [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] regions near the genes to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacob F, Monod J | year = 1961 | title = Genetic Regulatory Mechanisms in the Synthesis of Proteins | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 318–56 | doi = 10.1016/s0022-2836(61)80072-7 | pmid = 13718526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Later studies have shown that RNAs also regulate genes. There are several kinds of RNA-dependent processes in eukaryotes regulating the expression of genes at various points, such as [[RNA interference|RNAi]] repressing genes [[Post-transcriptional regulation|post-transcriptionally]],  [[long non-coding RNA]]s shutting down blocks of [[chromatin]] [[epigenetically]], and [[enhancer RNA]]s inducing increased gene expression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris K, Mattick J | year = 2014 | title = The rise of regulatory RNA | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 423–37 | doi = 10.1038/nrg3722 | pmid = 24776770 | pmc = 4314111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prokaryote|Bacteria and archaea]]  have also been shown to use regulatory RNA systems such as [[bacterial small RNA]]s and [[CRISPR]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gottesman S | year = 2005 | title = Micros for microbes: non-coding regulatory RNAs in bacteria | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 21 | issue = 7| pages = 399–404 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2005.05.008 | pmid = 15913835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for discovering [[microRNA]]s  (miRNAs), specific short RNA molecules that can base-pair with mRNAs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2006".

=== RNA interference by miRNAs ===
{{See also|RNA interference}}

Post-transcriptional expression levels of many genes can be controlled by [[RNA interference]], in which [[miRNA]]s, specific short RNA molecules, pair with mRNA regions and target them for degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fire  | display-authors = etal | year = 1998 | title = Potent and Specific Genetic Interference by double stranded RNA in Ceanorhabditis elegans | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6669| pages = 806–11 | doi = 10.1038/35888 | pmid = 9486653 | bibcode = 1998Natur.391..806F | s2cid = 4355692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[Antisense RNA|antisense]]-based process involves steps that first process the RNA so that it can [[Base pair|base-pair]] with a region of its target mRNAs. Once the base pairing occurs, other proteins direct the mRNA to be destroyed by [[nuclease]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Long non-coding RNAs ===
{{See also|Long non-coding RNA|l1=Long Non-coding RNA}}

Next to be linked to regulation were [[XIST|Xist]] and other [[long noncoding RNA]]s associated with [[X chromosome inactivation]].&amp;nbsp; Their roles, at first mysterious, were shown by [[Jeannie T. Lee]] and others to be the [[RNA silencing|silencing]] of blocks of chromatin via recruitment of [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]] complex so that messenger RNA could not be transcribed from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao J, Sun BK, Erwin JA, Song JJ, Lee JT | year = 2008 | title = Polycomb proteins targeted by a short repeat RNA to the mouse X chromosome | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5902| pages = 750–56 | pmid = 18974356 | doi = 10.1126/science.1163045 | pmc = 2748911 | bibcode = 2008Sci...322..750Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional lncRNAs, currently defined as RNAs of more than 200 base pairs that do not appear to have coding potential,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rinn JL, Chang HY | year = 2012 | title = Genome regulation by long noncoding RNAs | journal = Annu.

=== Enhancer RNAs ===
{{See also|Enhancer RNA}}

The third major group of regulatory RNAs is called [[enhancer RNA]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It is not clear at present whether they are a unique category of RNAs of various lengths or&amp;nbsp;constitute a distinct subset of lncRNAs.&amp;nbsp; In any case, they are transcribed from [[enhancers]], which are known regulatory sites in the DNA near genes they regulate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taft RJ, Kaplan CD, Simons C, Mattick JS | year = 2009 | title = Evolution, biogenesis and function of promoter- associated RNAs | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 8 | issue = 15| pages = 2332–38 | doi = 10.4161/cc.8.15.9154 | pmid = 19597344 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;They up-regulate the transcription of the gene(s) under control of the enhancer from which they are transcribed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orom UA, Derrien T, Beringer M, Gumireddy K, Gardini A | display-authors = etal | year = 2010 | title = 'Long noncoding RNAs with enhancer-like function in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 143 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | pmid = 20887892 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2010.09.001 | pmc = 4108080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulatory RNA in prokaryotes ===
At first, regulatory RNA was thought to be a eukaryotic phenomenon, a part of the explanation for why so much more transcription in higher organisms was seen than had been predicted. But as soon as researchers began to look for possible RNA regulators in bacteria, they turned up there as well, termed as small RNA (sRNA).&lt;ref&gt;EGH Wagner, P Romby. (2015). "Small RNAs in bacteria and archaea: who they are, what they do, and how they do it". ''Advances in genetics'' (Vol. 90, pp. 133–208).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Currently, the ubiquitous nature of systems of RNA regulation of genes has been discussed as support for the [[RNA World]] theory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Nelson, R.R. Breaker (2017) "The lost language of the RNA World."''Sci. Signal''.'''10''',eaam8812 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacterial small RNA]]s generally act via [[Antisense RNA|antisense]] pairing with mRNA to down-regulate its translation, either by affecting stability or affecting cis-binding ability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Riboswitch]]es have also been discovered. They are cis-acting regulatory RNA sequences acting [[Allosteric regulation|allosterically]].  They change shape when they bind [[metabolite]]s so that they gain or lose the ability to bind chromatin to regulate expression of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winklef WC | year = 2005 | title = Riboswitches and the role of noncoding RNAs in bacterial metabolic control | journal = Curr.

== In RNA processing ==
[[File:Synthesis of Pseudouridine.svg|thumb|Uridine to pseudouridine is a common RNA modification.]]
Many RNAs are involved in modifying other RNAs.
[[Intron]]s are [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]] out of [[pre-mRNA]] by [[spliceosome]]s, which contain several [[small nuclear RNA]]s (snRNA),&lt;ref name=Biochemistry/&gt; or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steitz TA, Steitz JA | title = A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 90 | issue = 14 | pages = 6498–502 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8341661 | pmc = 46959 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.14.6498 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.6498S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
RNA can also be altered by having its nucleotides modified to  nucleotides other than [[adenosine|A]], [[cytidine|C]], [[guanosine|G]] and [[uridine|U]].
In eukaryotes, modifications of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by [[small nucleolar RNA]]s (snoRNA; 60–300&amp;nbsp;nt),&lt;ref name=transcriptome&gt;{{cite book|title=Mining the transcriptome&amp;nbsp;– methods and applications|url=http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:10803/FULLTEXT01 | vauthors = Wirta W |date=2006|isbn=978-91-7178-436-0|publisher=School of Biotechnology, Royal Institute of Technology|location=Stockholm|oclc=185406288}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the [[nucleolus]] and [[Cajal body|cajal bodies]]. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA.

==RNA genomes==
Like DNA, RNA can carry genetic information. [[RNA virus]]es have [[genome]]s composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. [[Viroid]]s are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daròs JA, Elena SF, Flores R | title = Viroids: an Ariadne's thread into the RNA labyrinth | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–98 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16741503 | pmc = 1479586 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In reverse transcription===
Reverse transcribing viruses replicate their genomes by [[Reverse transcription|reverse transcribing]] DNA copies from their RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA. [[Retrotransposon]]s also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalendar R, Vicient CM, Peleg O, Anamthawat-Jonsson K, Bolshoy A, Schulman AH | title = Large retrotransposon derivatives: abundant, conserved but nonautonomous retroelements of barley and related genomes | journal = Genetics | volume = 166 | issue = 3 | pages = 1437–50 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15082561 | pmc = 1470764 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.166.3.1437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[telomerase]] contains an [[Telomerase RNA component|RNA that is used as template]] for building the ends of [[Eukaryotic chromosome structure|eukaryotic chromosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Podlevsky JD, Bley CJ, Omana RV, Qi X, Chen JJ | title = The telomerase database | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 36 | issue = Database issue | pages = D339–43 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18073191 | pmc = 2238860 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkm700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double-stranded RNA ==
[[File:Double-stranded RNA.gif|thumb|Double-stranded RNA]]
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA with two complementary strands, similar to the DNA found in all cells, but with the replacement of thymine by uracil and the adding of one oxygen atom. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some [[virus]]es ([[double-stranded RNA viruses]]). Double-stranded RNA, such as viral RNA or [[siRNA]], can trigger [[RNA interference]] in [[eukaryote]]s, as well as [[interferon]] response in [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blevins T, Rajeswaran R, Shivaprasad PV, Beknazariants D, Si-Ammour A, Park HS, Vazquez F, Robertson D, Meins F, Hohn T, Pooggin MM | title = Four plant Dicers mediate viral small RNA biogenesis and DNA virus induced silencing | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = 6233–46 | date = 2006 | pmid = 17090584 | pmc = 1669714 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl886 }}

== Circular RNA ==
{{main|Circular RNA}}

In the late 1970s, it was shown that there is a single stranded covalently closed, i.e. circular form of RNA expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdom (see [[Circular RNA|circRNA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu MT, Coca-Prados M | title = Electron microscopic evidence for the circular form of RNA in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 280 | issue = 5720 | pages = 339–40 | date = July 1979 | pmid = 460409 | doi = 10.1038/280339a0 | bibcode = 1979Natur.280..339H | s2cid = 19968869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; circRNAs are thought to arise via a "back-splice" reaction where the [[spliceosome]] joins a upstream 3' acceptor to a downstream 5' donor splice site. So far the function of circRNAs is largely unknown, although for few examples a microRNA sponging activity has been demonstrated.

Research on RNA has led to many important biological discoveries and numerous [[Nobel Prize]]s. [[Nucleic acid]]s were discovered in 1868 by [[Friedrich Miescher]], who called the material 'nuclein' since it was found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahm R | title = Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 278 | issue = 2 | pages = 274–88 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15680349 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.028 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature | vauthors = Caspersson T, Schultz J | title = Pentose nucleotides in the cytoplasm of growing tissues|date=1939|volume=143|doi=10.1038/143602c0|pages=602–03|issue=3623|bibcode=1939Natur.143..602C| s2cid = 4140563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Severo Ochoa]] won the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] (shared with [[Arthur Kornberg]]) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Ochoa S | title = Enzymatic synthesis of ribonucleic acid|work=Nobel Lecture|date=1959|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/ochoa-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa ([[polynucleotide phosphorylase]]) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rich A, Davies D |title=A New Two-Stranded Helical Structure: Polyadenylic Acid and Polyuridylic Acid|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1956|volume=78|issue=14|doi=10.1021/ja01595a086|pages=3548–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of the 77 nucleotides of a yeast tRNA was found by [[Robert W. Holley]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holley RW, Apgar J, Everett GA, Madison JT, Marquisee M, Merrill SH, Penswick JR, Zamir A | title = Structure of a ribonucleic acid | journal = Science | volume = 147 | issue = 3664 | pages = 1462–65 | date = March 1965 | pmid = 14263761 | doi = 10.1126/science.147.3664.1462 | bibcode = 1965Sci...147.1462H | s2cid = 40989800 | display-authors = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; winning Holley the [[List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine|1968 Nobel Prize in Medicine]] (shared with [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and [[Marshall Nirenberg]]).

In the early 1970s, [[retrovirus]]es and [[reverse transcriptase]] were discovered, showing for the first time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, [[David Baltimore]], [[Renato Dulbecco]] and [[Howard Temin]] were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.
In 1976, [[Walter Fiers]] and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence of an RNA virus genome, that of [[bacteriophage MS2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiers W, Contreras R, Duerinck F, Haegeman G, Iserentant D, Merregaert J, Min Jou W, Molemans F, Raeymaekers A, Van den Berghe A, Volckaert G, Ysebaert M | title = Complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage MS2 RNA: primary and secondary structure of the replicase gene | journal = Nature | volume = 260 | issue = 5551 | pages = 500–07 | date = April 1976 | pmid = 1264203 | doi = 10.1038/260500a0 | bibcode = 1976Natur.260..500F | s2cid = 4289674 | display-authors = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[intron]]s and [[RNA splicing]] were discovered in both mammalian viruses and in cellular genes, resulting in a 1993 Nobel to [[Philip A. Sharp|Philip Sharp]] and [[Richard J. Roberts|Richard Roberts]].
Catalytic RNA molecules ([[ribozyme]]s) were discovered in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to [[Thomas Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]]. In 1990, it was found in ''[[Petunia]]'' that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now known to be a result of [[RNA interference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Napoli C, Lemieux C, Jorgensen R | title = Introduction of a Chimeric Chalcone Synthase Gene into Petunia Results in Reversible Co-Suppression of Homologous Genes in trans | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 279–89 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 12354959 | pmc = 159885 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.2.4.279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dafny-Yelin M, Chung SM, Frankman EL, Tzfira T | title = pSAT RNA interference vectors: a modular series for multiple gene down-regulation in plants | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 145 | issue = 4 | pages = 1272–81 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17766396 | pmc = 2151715 | doi = 10.1104/pp.107.106062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, 22 nt long RNAs, now called [[microRNA]]s, were found to have a role in the [[developmental biology|development]] of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruvkun G | s2cid = 83506718 | title = Molecular biology.

Studies on RNA interference gleaned a Nobel Prize for [[Andrew Z. Fire|Andrew Fire]] and [[Craig Mello]] in 2006, and another Nobel was awarded for studies on the transcription of RNA to [[Roger Kornberg]] in the same year. The discovery of gene regulatory RNAs has led to attempts to develop drugs made of RNA, such as [[siRNA]], to silence genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fichou Y, Férec C | title = The potential of oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 563–70 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17045686 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the Nobel prizes awarded for research on RNA in 2009 it was awarded for the elucidation of the atomic structure of the ribosome to [[Venki Ramakrishnan]], [[Thomas A. Steitz]], and [[Ada Yonath]].

=== Relevance for prebiotic chemistry and abiogenesis ===
In 1968, [[Carl Woese]] hypothesized that RNA might be catalytic and suggested that the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=982323891&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=982323891.pdf|title=Common sequence structure properties and stable regions in RNA secondary structures|date=2006|work=Dissertation, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg im Breisgau|page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309212648/http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=982323891&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=982323891.pdf|archive-date=March 9, 2012|url-status=dead|vauthors=Siebert S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szathmáry E | title = The origin of the genetic code: amino acids as cofactors in an RNA world | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 223–29 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10354582 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(99)01730-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2022, scientists reported that RNA was found to be formed spontaneously on prebiotic [[Volcanic glass|basalt lava glass]] which is presumed to have been abundantly available on the [[early Earth]].&lt;ref name="AST-20220519"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jerome, Craig A. |display-authors=et al. |title=Catalytic Synthesis of Polyribonucleic Acid on Prebiotic Rock Glasses |date=19 May 2022 |journal=[[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=629–636 |doi=10.1089/ast.2022.0027 |pmid=35588195 |pmc=9233534 |bibcode=2022AsBio..22..629J |s2cid=248917871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PO-20220603"&gt;{{cite news |author=Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution |title=Scientists announce a breakthrough in determining life's origin on Earth—and maybe Mars |url=https://phys.org/news/2022-06-scientists-breakthrough-life-earthand-mars.html |date=3 June 2022 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=3 June 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, complex [[DNA]] and RNA [[nucleotide]]s, including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], were reportedly formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starter chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], an [[organic compound]] commonly found in [[meteorite]]s. [[Pyrimidine]], like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), is one of the most carbon-rich compounds found in the [[Universe]] and may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory|title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory|last=Marlaire|first=Ruth | name-list-style = vanc |date=3 March 2015|work=[[NASA]]|access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2022, astronomers reported the discovery of massive amounts of [[Abiogenesis#Producing molecules: prebiotic synthesis|prebiotic molecule]]s, including possible RNA precursors, in the [[Galactic Center]] of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].&lt;ref name="SA-20220708"&gt;{{cite news |last=Starr |first=Michelle |title=Loads of Precursors For RNA Have Been Detected in The Center of Our Galaxy |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-found-a-bunch-of-rna-precursors-in-the-galactic-center |date=8 July 2022 |work=[[ScienceAlert]] |accessdate=9 July 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FASS-20220708"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rivilla, Victor M. |display-authors=et al. |title=Molecular Precursors of the RNA-World in Space: New Nitriles in the G+0.693−0.027 Molecular Cloud |date=8 July 2022 |journal=[[Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences]] |volume=9 |page=876870 |doi=10.3389/fspas.2022.876870 |arxiv=2206.01053 |bibcode=2022FrASS...9.6870R |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rhPCR, the primers are designed with a removable amplification block on the 3’ end.  Amplification of the blocked primer is dependent on the cleavage activity of a [[hyperthermophilic]] [[archaeal]] Type II [[RNase H]] enzyme during hybridization to the complementary target sequence.  This RNase H enzyme possesses several useful characteristics that enhance the PCR.  First, it has very little enzymatic activity at low temperature, enabling a “[[hot start PCR]]” without modifications to the [[DNA polymerase]].    Second, the cleavage efficiency of the enzyme is reduced in the presence of mismatches near the RNA residue.  This allows for reduced [[primer dimer]] formation,&lt;ref name="dobosy_2011"/&gt; detection of [[alternative splicing]] variants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Erin D. |last2=Simpson |first2=Laura J. |last3=Rios |first3=Cydney L. |last4=Ringel |first4=Lando |last5=Lachowicz-Scroggins |first5=Marrah E. |last6=Peters |first6=Michael C. |last7=Wesolowska-Andersen |first7=Agata |last8=Gonzalez |first8=Jeanmarie R. |last9=MacLeod |first9=Hannah J. |last10=Christian |first10=Laura S. |last11=Yuan |first11=Shaopeng |last12=Barry |first12=Liam |last13=Woodruff |first13=Prescott G. |last14=Ansel |first14=K.

== Principle ==
rhPCR [[DNA primer|primers]] consist of three sections.  1) The 5’ DNA section, equivalent in length and melting temperature (Tm) requirements to a standard PCR primer, is extended after cleavage by the RNase HII enzyme.  2) A single RNA base provides the cleavage site for the RNase HII.  3) A short 3’ extension of four or five bases followed by a blocker (usually a short, non-extendable molecule like a [[propanediol]]) prevents extension by a DNA polymerase until removal.  A rhPCR reaction begins with the primers and template free in solution (Figure 1).  While free in solution, these primers are not deblocked by the RNase HII enzyme, as they must be in an RNA:DNA heteroduplex with the template to be cleaved.  Once bound to the template, the rhPCR primers are cleaved by the thermostable RNase HII enzyme.  This removes the block, allowing for the DNA polymerase to extend off of the primers.  The cycling of the PCR reaction continues the process.  rhPCR primers are designed so that after cleavage by the RNase H2 enzyme, the Tm of the primers are still greater than the annealing temperature of PCR reaction.  These primers can be used in both 5’ nuclease [[Taqman]] and [[SYBR Green]] types of [[quantitative PCR]].

== Applications ==
rhPCR can be used for [[quantitative PCR]] and medical or environmental laboratories:

* ''[[Gene expression]]'' assays
* ''[[Alternative splicing]]''
* ''[[SNP genotyping]]''
* ''[[Multiplex PCR]]''

{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}
In [[biology]], '''robustness''' is used to describe a [[taxon]] with a stronger and heavier build ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) when compared to a related [[Gracility|gracile]] taxon. The terms are used in contrast to one another. The term is used by [[biological anthropology|physical anthropologists]] and [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to refer to a big-[[bone]]d and [[skeletal muscle|muscular]] body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/tutorials/pglossary.htm#robust|title = Glossary of Physical Anthropology Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, members of the genus ''[[Sapajus]]'' have robust body types and are called the [[robust capuchin monkey]]s while members of the genus ''[[Cebus]]'' have gracile body types and are called the [[gracile capuchin monkey]]s. Male and female members of the same species may display [[sexual dimorphism]] and have robust and gracile morphologies.

The terms "robust" vs. "gracile" are used in the context of [[human evolution]], to distinguish:
*"robust" vs. "gracile" [[australopithecines]], see ''[[Paranthropus]]''
*"robust" [[archaic humans]] vs. "gracile" [[anatomically modern humans]]
*"robust" [[early modern humans]]  ([[Cro-Magnon]]) vs. "gracile" [[Epipaleolithic]] humans ([[Combe-Capelle]])

[[File:Rattenkoederbox 4521.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Typical rat poison bait station (Germany, 2010)]]
'''Rodenticides''' are [[chemical]]s made and sold for the purpose of killing [[rodent]]s. While commonly referred to as "'''rat poison'''", rodenticides are also used to kill [[mice]], [[squirrels]], [[groundhog|woodchucks]], [[chipmunks]], [[porcupine]]s, [[nutria]], [[beaver]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/rodenticides.html#:~:text=Rodenticides%20are%20pesticides%20that%20kill,they%20may%20sometimes%20require%20control|title = Rodenticides}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vole]]s.&lt;ref name="Tobin1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark E.

Some rodenticides are lethal after one exposure while others require more than one. Rodents are disinclined to gorge on an unknown food (perhaps reflecting an adaptation to their inability to [[emesis|vomit]]),&lt;ref name="Kapoor-et-al-2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kapoor | first1=Harit | last2=Lohani | first2=Kush Raj | last3=Lee | first3=Tommy H. | last4=Agrawal | first4=Devendra K. | last5=Mittal | first5=Sumeet K. | title=Animal Models of Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma-Past, Present, and Future | journal=Clinical and Translational Science | publisher=[[Wiley Publishing|Wiley]] | volume=8 | issue=6 | date=2015-07-27 | doi=10.1111/cts.12304 | pages=841–847| pmid=26211420 | pmc=4703452 }}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to sample, wait and observe whether it makes them or other rats sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smithsonian: Why rodents can't throw up|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-rodents-cant-throw-up-in-case-you-were-wondering-25707720/?no-ist|access-date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratbehavior.org/FoodChoices.htm|title=How do rats choose what to eat?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon of [[poison shyness]] is the rationale for poisons that kill only after multiple doses.

Besides being directly toxic to the mammals that ingest them, including dogs, cats, and humans, many rodenticides present a [[secondary poisoning]] risk to animals that hunt or scavenge the dead corpses of rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/rodenticides.html|title = Rodenticides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes of rodenticides==
[[File:Rat Poison.jpg|thumb|Poison baits infused with peanuts to attract rodents.]]

=== Anticoagulants ===

[[Anticoagulant]]s are defined as chronic (death occurs one to two weeks after ingestion of the lethal dose, rarely sooner), single-dose (second generation) or multiple-dose (first generation) rodenticides, acting by effective blocking of the vitamin-K cycle, resulting in inability to produce essential blood-clotting factors—mainly coagulation factors II ([[prothrombin]]) and VII ([[proconvertin]]).

In addition to this specific metabolic disruption, massive toxic doses of [[4-Hydroxycoumarins|4-hydroxycoumarin]], 4-thiochromenone and [[1,3-indandione]] anticoagulants cause damage to tiny blood vessels ([[capillary|capillaries]]), increasing their permeability, causing internal bleeding. These effects are gradual, developing over several days. In the final phase of the intoxication, the exhausted rodent collapses due to [[hemorrhagic shock]] or severe [[anemia]] and dies calmly. The question of whether the use of these rodenticides can be considered humane has been raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meerburg BG, Brom FW, Kijlstra A |title=The ethics of rodent control |journal=Pest Manag Sci |volume=64 |issue=12 |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/ps.1623 |pmid=18642329 |pages=1205–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main benefit of anticoagulants over other poisons is that the time taken for the poison to induce death means that the rats do not associate the damage with their feeding habits.

* Second-generation agents are far more toxic than those of the first generation. They are generally applied in lower concentrations in baits—usually on the order of 0.001% to 0.005%—are lethal after a single ingestion of bait and are also effective against strains of rodents that became resistant to first-generation anticoagulants; thus, the second-generation anticoagulants are sometimes referred to as "superwarfarins".&lt;ref name="pmid17655702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kotsaftis P, Girtovitis F, Boutou A, Ntaios G, Makris PE |title=Haemarthrosis after superwarfarin poisoning |journal=Eur.

| Indirect
| Sometimes, anticoagulant rodenticides are potentiated by an [[antibiotic]] or [[bacteriostatic agent]], most commonly [[sulfaquinoxaline]]. The aim of this association is that the antibiotic suppresses intestinal [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[microflora]], which are a source of vitamin K. Diminished production of vitamin K by the intestinal microflora contributes to the action of anticoagulants.  Added [[vitamin D]] also has a synergistic effect with anticoagulants.

[[Vitamin K|Vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] has been suggested, and successfully used, as antidote for [[pet]]s or humans accidentally or intentionally exposed to anticoagulant poisons.  Some of these poisons act by inhibiting [[liver]] functions&lt;!--relevance to blood transfusion?--&gt; and in advanced stages of poisoning, several blood-clotting factors are absent, and the volume of circulating blood is diminished, so that a blood transfusion (optionally with the clotting factors present) can save a person who has been poisoned, an advantage over some older poisons.

=== Metal phosphides ===
[[File:5654-Linxia-City-market-rat-poison-vendor.jpg|thumb|Rat poison vendor's stall at a market in [[Linxia City]], China]]
Metal phosphides have been used as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1–3 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually [[zinc phosphide]]) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate toxic [[phosphine]] gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait for a week or two (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2–4 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily).

Zinc phosphide is typically added to rodent baits in a concentration of 0.75% to 2.0%. The baits have strong, pungent garlic-like odor due to the [[phosphine]] liberated by [[hydrolysis]]. The odor attracts (or, at least, does not repel) rodents, but has a repulsive effect on other mammals. Birds, notably [[wild turkey]]s, are not sensitive to the smell, and might feed on the bait, and thus fall victim to the poison.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The tablets or pellets (usually aluminium, calcium or magnesium phosphide for fumigation/gassing) may also contain other chemicals which evolve [[ammonia]], which helps reduce the potential for spontaneous [[combustion]] or [[explosion]] of the [[phosphine]] gas.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Metal phosphides do not accumulate in the tissues of poisoned animals, so the risk of [[secondary poisoning]] is low.

Before the advent of anticoagulants, phosphides were the favored kind of rat poison. During World War II, they came into use in United States because of shortage of [[strychnine]] due to the Japanese occupation of the territories where the [[strychnine tree]] is grown. Phosphides are rather fast-acting rat poisons, resulting in the rats dying usually in open areas, instead of in the affected buildings.

Phosphides used as rodenticides include:
* [[aluminium phosphide]] ([[fumigant]] and bait)
* [[calcium phosphide]]  ([[fumigant]] only)
* magnesium phosphide ([[fumigant]] only)
* [[zinc phosphide]] (bait only)

=== Hypercalcemia (vitamin D overdose)===
[[Cholecalciferol]] (vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[ergocalciferol]] (vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are used as [[Cholecalciferol#Use as rodenticide|rodenticides]]. They are toxic to rodents for the same reason they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate [[homeostasis]] in the body. [[Vitamin D|Vitamins D]] are essential in minute quantities (few [[international unit|IU]]s per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble [[vitamin]]s, they are toxic in larger doses, causing [[hypervitaminosis D]]. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes [[hypercalcemia]], raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into [[ionised]] form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, [CaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), which circulates dissolved in the [[blood plasma]]. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that [[blood vessel]]s, [[kidney]]s, the [[stomach]] wall and [[lung]]s are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and action potential propagation between the atria and ventricles), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol (30,000&amp;nbsp;IU/g)&lt;ref name=vertebratePestProceedings1984&gt;{{cite conference |title=CHOLECALCIFEROL: A UNIQUE TOXICANT FOR RODENT CONTROL |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/vpc11/22/ |conference=Proceedings of the Eleventh Vertebrate Pest Conference (1984) |publisher=University of Nebraska Lincoln |date=March 1984 |quote=''Cholecalciferol is an acute (single-feeding) and/or chronic (multiple-feeding) rodenticide toxicant with unique activity for controlling commensal rodents including anticoagulant-resistant rats.

There is an important feature of calciferols toxicology, that they are [[Synergy#Biological sciences|synergist]]ic with [[anticoagulant]] toxicant. In other words, mixtures of anticoagulants and calciferols in same bait are more toxic than a sum of toxicities of the anticoagulant and the calciferol in the bait, so that a massive hypercalcemic effect can be achieved by a substantially lower calciferol content in the bait, and vice versa, a more pronounced anticoagulant/hemorrhagic effects are observed if the calciferol is present. This synergism is mostly used in calciferol low concentration baits, because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive than effective concentrations of most anticoagulants.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The first application of a calciferol in rodenticidal bait was in the Sorex product Sorexa D (with a different formula than today's Sorexa D), back in the early 1970s, which contained 0.025% warfarin and 0.1% ergocalciferol. Today, Sorexa CD contains a 0.0025% difenacoum and 0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either 0.075-0.1% calciferols (e.g. Quintox) alone or alongside an anticoagulant are marketed.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The Merck Veterinary Manual states the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although this rodenticide [cholecalciferol] was introduced with claims that it was less toxic to nontarget species than to rodents, clinical experience has shown that rodenticides containing cholecalciferol are a significant health threat to dogs and cats. Cholecalciferol produces hypercalcemia, which results in systemic calcification of soft tissue, leading to [[kidney failure]], cardiac abnormalities, hypertension, CNS depression and GI upset. Signs generally develop within 18-36 hours of ingestion and can include depression, anorexia, polyuria and polydipsia. As serum calcium concentrations increase, clinical signs become more severe. ...&amp;nbsp;GI smooth muscle excitability decreases and is manifest by anorexia, vomiting and constipation. ...&amp;nbsp;Loss of renal concentrating ability is a direct result of hypercalcemia. As hypercalcemia persists, mineralization of the kidneys results in progressive renal insufficiency."&lt;ref name=merckd&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.msdvetmanual.com/toxicology/rodenticide-poisoning/cholecalciferol
| title=Merck Veterinary Manual - Cholecalciferol
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additional anticoagulant renders the bait more toxic to pets as well as humans. Upon single ingestion, solely calciferol-based baits are considered generally safer to birds than second generation anticoagulants or acute toxicants. Treatment in pets is mostly supportive, with [[intravenous]] fluids and [[pamidronate]] disodium. The hormone [[calcitonin]] is no longer commonly used.&lt;ref name=merckd/&gt;

===Combinations===
In some countries, fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e., anticoagulant + antibiotic + vitamin D, are used. Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with an antibiotic and/or vitamin D are considered to be effective even against most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely brodifacoum and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025% to 0.005% are so toxic that resistance is unknown, and even rodents resistant to other rodenticides are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.

==Low-toxicity/Eco-friendly rodenticides==
[[Powdered corn cob]] and [[corn meal gluten]] have been developed as rodenticides. They were approved in the EU and patented in the US in 2013. These preparations rely on dehydration and electrolyte imbalance to cause death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU approves powdered corn cob as biocidal active|url=http://chemicalwatch.com/16094/eu-approves-powdered-corn-cob-as-biocidal-active|access-date=22 August 2013|newspaper=Chemical Watch: Global Risk &amp; Regulation News|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFI Claims Patent Services (Google)|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US8574638|access-date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inert gas killing of burrowing pest animals is another method with no impact on scavenging wildlife. One such method has been commercialized and sold under the brand name [[Rat Ice]].

==Non-target issues==

===Secondary poisoning and risks to wildlife===

One of the potential problems when using rodenticides is that dead or weakened rodents may be eaten by other wildlife, either predators or scavengers. Members of the public deploying rodenticides may not be aware of this or may not follow the product's instructions closely enough.

The faster a rodenticide acts, the more critical this problem may be. For the fast-acting rodenticide bromethalin, for example, there is no diagnostic test or antidote.&lt;ref name=vetnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/dvm/Rodenticide-manufacturer-defies-EPA-requests-heari/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/809906|title=Rodenticide manufacturer defies EPA, requests hearing on anticoagulant use|access-date=4 April 2015|archive-date=12 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112024319/http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/dvm/Rodenticide-manufacturer-defies-EPA-requests-heari/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/809906|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led environmental researchers to conclude that low strength, long duration rodenticides (generally first generation anticoagulants) are the best balance between maximum effect and minimum risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poisons used to kill rodents have safer alternatives|date=15 January 2013|url=http://www.audubonmagazine.org/articles/conservation/poisons-used-kill-rodents-have-safer-alternatives|access-date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed US legislation change===
In 2008, after assessing human health and ecological effects, as well as benefits,&lt;ref name="urlFinal Risk Mitigation Decision for Ten Rodenticides | Pesticides | US EPA" /&gt; the US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) announced measures to reduce risks associated with ten rodenticides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/rodenticides/rodent-control-pesticide-safety-review Rodent Control Pesticide Safety Review]&lt;/ref&gt; New restrictions by sale and distribution restrictions, minimum package size requirements, use site restriction, and tamper resistant products would have taken effect in 2011. The regulations were delayed pending a legal challenge by manufacturer Reckitt-Benkiser.&lt;ref name=vetnews /&gt;{{update after|2012}}

==Notable rat eradications==
The entire rat populations of several islands have been eradicated, most notably [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|New Zealand's Campbell Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZ Government: Campbell Island conservation sanctuary rat free|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/campbell-island-conservation-sanctuary-rat-free|access-date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawadax Island]], Alaska (formerly known as Rat Island),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borrell|first=Brendan|title=Where eagles die|journal=Nature|date=18 January 2011|doi=10.1038/news.2011.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macquarie Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|title=Pests eradicated from Macquarie Island|url=https://www.antarctica.gov.au/magazine/issue-26-june-2014/science/pests-eradicated-from-macquarie-island/|access-date=3 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canna, Scotland]] (declared rat-free in 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=27 April 2010|title=Island which spent £600,000 getting rid of rats over-run with rabbits|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/7634896/Island-which-spent-600000-getting-rid-of-rats-over-run-with-rabbits.html|access-date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Friends of South Georgia Island (www.fosgi.org), all of the rats have been eliminated from South Georgia Island (which is about the size of Long Island, New York).

An example of Rosa's rule is that the number of [[Trilobite#Thorax|thoracic]] [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]] in adults (or [[Trilobite#Development|holaspids]]) may vary in [[Cambrian]] [[trilobite]] species, while from the [[Ordovician]] the number of thoracic segments is constant in entire genera, families, and even suborders.&lt;ref name='Hughes'&gt;{{cite journal|first= Nigel C.|last= Hughes|year= 1994|title= Ontogeny, Intraspecific Variation, and Systematics of the Late Cambrian Trilobite Dikelocephalus|journal= Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology|volume= 79|issue= 79|pages= 89|accessdate= 2014-03-07|url= http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Paleobiology/pdf_hi/SCtP-0079.pdf|doi=10.5479/si.00810266.79.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a trend of decreasing trait variation between individuals of a taxon as the taxon develops across evolutionary time can be observed. The rule is named for Italian paleontologist [[Daniele Rosa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UM4XViDlrf0C&amp;pg=PA358&amp;lpg=PA358&amp;dq=%22progressive+reduction+of+variability%22+%22daniele+rosa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aH2T4YBOav&amp;sig=7myRW8Rw8A84ylw8yg4E6a8HrDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OWNBU5azArjIsASsm4GIAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22progressive%20reduction%20of%20variability%22%20%22daniele%20rosa%22&amp;f=false Life's Splendid Drama: Evolutionary Biology and the Reconstruction of Life's Ancestry, 1860-1940], by [[Peter J.

The '''Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh''' was a learned society based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] "for the cultivation of the physical sciences".&lt;ref name = RPS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~rsgs/ifa/hdms/rpse/provlist.htm |title=Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh |publisher=Images for All |access-date= 8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was founded in 1771 as the '''Physico-Chirurgical Society''' but soon after changed its name to the '''Physical Society'''. After being granted a Royal Charter in 1778 it became the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=RPSE&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1771rpse.html |title= Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh |publisher= Scholarly Societies Project |accessdate= 8 November 2015 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150717122346/http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1771rpse.html |archive-date= 17 July 2015 |df= dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

It absorbed a number of other societies over the next fifty years, including the '''Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society''' in 1782 (not to be confused with the extant Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, founded in 1821),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmedchi.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to The Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh |website=www.edmedchi.co.uk |access-date=2020-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''American Physical Society''' in 1796 (not to be confused with the extant [[American Physical Society]], founded in 1899), the '''Hibernian Medical Society''' in 1799, the '''Chemical Society''' in 1803, the '''Natural History Society''' in 1812 and the '''Didactic Society''' in 1813.&lt;ref name= RPSE/&gt;

The society occupied a lecture hall in Nicholson Street, Edinburgh, complete with library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia perthensis, or, Universal dictionary of the arts ..., Volume 21 |page=124}} &lt;/ref&gt; From 1854 to 1965, it published the journal ''Proceedings of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh'', devoted to articles on experimental biology and natural history.&lt;ref name= RPS/&gt;

Members of the society were known as Fellows and permitted to use the post-nominal letters FRPSE. Presidents were elected at intervals, sometimes more than one for each year.

Some of the records of the Society, for the period 1828–1884, are maintained by the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]].

The '''Royal Society Africa Prize'''  (formerly known as the '''Royal Society Pfizer Prize''') has been awarded by the [[Royal Society]] since 2006 to African-based researchers at the start of their career who are making innovative contributions to the biological sciences in Africa. £60,000 is awarded as a grant for the recipient to carry out a research project that is linked to an African centre of scientific excellence, normally a University or equivalent research centre, and a further £5,000 is given directly to the prizewinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://royalsociety.org/Pfizer-Award/|title = The Royal Society Pfizer Award|publisher = The Royal Society|accessdate = 14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final award under the Pfizer name was made in 2016, after which the award was renamed the Royal Society Africa Prize, and consists of a grant of £11,000 and a gift of £1000.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/africa-prize/|title=Royal Society Africa Prize |publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 16 June 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses}}
{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}
In a group of animals (usually a [[Litter (animal)|litter]] of animals born in multiple births), a '''runt''' is a member which is significantly smaller or weaker than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?runt | title = Cancer | contribution = Runt | publisher = NCL | place = UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its small size, a runt in a litter faces obvious disadvantage, including difficulties in competing with its siblings for survival and possible rejection by its mother. Therefore, in the wild, a runt is less likely to survive [[infancy]].

Even among [[domestic animals]], runts often face rejection. They may be placed under the direct care of an experienced animal breeder, although the animal's size and weakness coupled with the lack of natural parental care make this difficult. Some tamed animals are the result of reared runts.

Not all litters have runts. All animals in a litter will naturally vary slightly in size and weight, but the smallest is not considered a "runt" if it is healthy and close in weight to its littermates. It may be perfectly capable of competing with its siblings for nutrition and other resources. A runt is specifically an animal who suffered in utero from deprivation of nutrients by comparison to its siblings, or from a genetic defect, and thus is born underdeveloped or less fit than expected.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
* [[Wilbur (Charlotte's Web)|Wilbur]], the pig from ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', is the runt of his litter.
* Orson, the pig in Jim Davis' ''[[U.S. Acres]]'', is a runt who was bullied by his normal siblings. The strip changed direction when he was moved to a different farm and settled in with a supporting cast of oddball animals.
* Shade the bat from ''[[Silverwing (novel)|Silverwing]]'' is a runt.
* Fiver and Pipkin from ''[[Watership Down]]'' are runts, and their names in the [[Lapine language]], ''Hrairoo'' and ''Hlao-roo'', reflect this fact (the suffix ''-roo'' means "Small" or "undersized").
* [[Clifford the Big Red Dog]] was born a runt, but inexplicably began to grow explosively until he became 25 feet tall. 
* [[Cadpig]], a female [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] puppy in Dodie Smith's children's novels ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and ''[[The Starlight Barking]]'', is the runt of her litter and is thought to be stillborn, until Mr. Dearly revives her. 
*[[Ruth (dragon)|Ruth]], the hero [[Dragons (Pern)|Pernese dragon]]net from [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s novel [[the White Dragon (novel)|''The White Dragon'']], is a runt whose egg is smaller and has a harder shell than all others in the clutch. He would have died save for the intervention of young [[Jaxom]].
* [[The Sheep-Pig|Babe]], the eponymous piglet hero of [[Dick King-Smith]]'s book (and the [[Babe (film)|film]] based on the novel), is a runt. In fact, he was chosen for the competition at which Farmer Hoggett won him essentially ''because'' he was a runt - his runt status therefore saving his life and shaping his destiny.
* Scourge from the ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' book series was a runt. 
* The title character from the novel ''[[Runt (novel)|Runt]]'', as the name implies, is the smallest of his wolf litter.
*Little Ann from ''[[Where The Red Fern Grows]]'' was the runt of her litter, and smaller than her brother Old Dan.
*Daggie Dogfoot from ''Pigs Might Fly'' by [[Dick King-Smith|Dick King Smith]] was the runt of his litter, and it was because he was born a runt he was taken away and came back. He later learns to swim and then saves his pig herd from a flood.
*The Big Friendly Giant from [[Roald Dahl]]'s children's book ''[[The BFG]]'' is nicknamed "Runt" by other giants who are much bigger and stronger.

===Film and television===
* [[Goliath II]], in the Disney film of the same name, was a runt elephant. Hardly bigger than a mouse, he was an embarrassment to his father, Goliath I, who was a giant, and resented by the other elephants of the herd, who had to avoid stepping on him. He redeemed himself when he proved to be unafraid of a mouse.
*In both the [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|1961 version]] and [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|1996 version]] of Dodie Smith's 101 Dalmatians, the character of Lucky is portrayed as the runt of the litter (instead of Cadpig). However, the accompanying [[101 Dalmatians: The Series|TV series]] portrayed Cadpig as the runt again.
*The [[dire wolf]] named Ghost, in HBO's adaptation of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' book series, was the runt of his litter of six pups, as well as an [[albino]]. In the book, he was the biggest of the six in the litter.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], Chapter 7, Arya I.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Runt, an omega wolf from ''[[Alpha and Omega (film)|Alpha and Omega]]'' series, is a runt among his pack and family.
*Patchi, the main character from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs (film)|Walking with Dinosaurs]]'', is the runt of a clutch of [[pachyrhinosaurus]] eggs.
*Arlo, the main character from ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'', is the runt of his siblings, but born from a big egg.
*[[Mr. Peanutbutter]], a main character from ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', is one of the runts from his litter. His brother, Captain Peanutbutter, tells Mr. Peanutbutter that he is his favorite runt of the litter.
*Rex, the title character of ''[[Rex the Runt]]'', is a runt.
*Chief, the main character from [[Wes Anderson|Wes Anderson's]] ''[[Isle of Dogs (film)|Isle of Dogs]]'', is the runt of his litter.
*Bhoot, the wolf cub of the 2018 film [[Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle]], is the runt of the Akela pack. He becomes Mowgli's best friend.
*Shaun the Sheep, from the eponymous [[Shaun the Sheep|TV series]] and the ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' film "[[A Close Shave]]", is the smallest but most intelligent of all the adult sheep in the flock, with only the lamb Timmy being smaller.
*In ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]'', the titular character is referred to as "Runt" by the other giants due to him being the smallest out of all the giants.
*In the [[Chicken Little (2005 film)|2005 Disney adaptation]] of [[Henny Penny|Chicken Little]], a character named Runt of the Litter is a large pig that towers over the other characters, but is small compared to the rest of his family.

===Real-life instances===
* [[Jock of the Bushveld|Jock]] was the runt of a litter of Staffordshire Bull Terriers who was saved from drowning by [[Sir Percy Fitzpatrick]], who later wrote about his life with the dog in [[Jock of the Bushveld]].
*Popular [[YouTube]] Channel "[[The Dodo (website)|The Dodo]]" has many episodes which focus on runts of the litter, most being abandoned either by breeders or their parents, and later revived by rescuers.
* "Runt" was an early career moniker (ca. 1970) for [[Todd Rundgren]], his band, and the title of his/their eponymous first album.

[[File:Medical sampling equipment.jpg|thumb]]
In [[medicine]], '''sampling''' is gathering of [[matter]] from the body to aid in the process of a [[medical diagnosis]] and/or evaluation of an [[indication (medicine)|indication]] for treatment, further [[medical test]]s or other procedures. In this sense, the '''sample''' is the gathered matter, and the '''sampling tool''' or '''sampler''' is the person or material to collect the sample.

Sampling is a prerequisite for many [[medical test]]s, but generally not for [[medical history]], [[physical examination]] and [[radiologic test]]s.

*Obtaining excretions or materials that leave the body anyway, such as [[urine]], [[Feces|stool]], [[sputum]], or [[vomitus]], by direct collection as they exit.  A sample of [[saliva]] can also be collected from the mouth.  
[[Surgery#Types of surgery|Excision]] (cutting out), a surgical method for the removal of solid or soft tissue samples. 
*{{anchor|aspiration}}Puncture (also called ''centesis'') followed by aspiration is the main method used for sampling of many types of tissues and body fluids. Examples are [[thoracocentesis]] to sample [[pleural fluid]], and [[amniocentesis]] to sample [[amniotic fluid]]. The main method of centesis, in turn, is [[fine needle aspiration]], but there are also somewhat differently designed needles, such as for [[bone marrow aspiration]]. Puncture ''without'' aspiration may suffice in, for example, [[capillary blood sampling]].
* Scraping or swiping. In a [[Pap test]], cells are scraped off a [[uterine cervix]] with a special [[spatula]] and brush or a special broom device that is inserted through a vagina without having to puncture any tissue. [[Epithelial cell]]s for [[DNA]] testing can be obtained by swiping the inside of a cheek in a mouth with a swab.

===Biopsy or cytopathology===
In terms of sampling technique, a [[biopsy]] generally refers to a preparation where the normal tissue structure is preserved, availing for examination of both individual cells and their organization for the study of [[histology]], while a sample for [[cytopathology]] is prepared primarily for the examination of individual cells, not necessarily preserving the tissue structure. Examples of biopsy procedures are [[bone marrow biopsy]], [[brain biopsy]], [[skin biopsy]] and [[liver biopsy]].

==By sampled matter==
Different types of matter that are sampled can be categorized by solidness versus fluidity, such as:
*Solid tissue, such as in [[bone marrow biopsy]]
*Soft tissue, such as in a [[muscle biopsy]]
*[[Body fluid]]s such as [[blood]]

===Body fluid sampling===
[[Body fluid#Sampling|Body fluid sampling]] includes:
*{{anchor|blood}} [[Blood|Blood sampling]] for any [[blood test]], including:
**[[Arterial blood]] sampling, such as by [[radial artery puncture]].  This can be done for [[arterial blood gas]] analysis. 
**[[Capillary blood sampling]], generally by using a [[blood lancet]] for puncture, followed by sampling by [[capillary action]] with a test strip or small pipe.  This is common for routine [[diabetic]] monitoring for [[glucose]].
**[[Venous]] blood sampling, also called ''phlebotomy''. It is generally done by [[venipuncture]] (which can also be used for [[intravenous therapy]]). Other than routine diabetic monitoring for glucose, the majority of [[blood test]]s are done on samples of venous blood taken by a [[health professional]], including [[phlebotomist]]s who are specifically trained in venipuncture. Such samples are commonly collected in capped [[test tube]]s, often with a small amount of some sort of preservative.  
*[[Cerebrospinal fluid]] sampling, generally by [[lumbar puncture]]
*[[Pleural fluid]] sampling, generally by [[thoracocentesis]] 
*[[Amniotic fluid]] sampling, generally by [[amniocentesis]]
*[[Peritoneal fluid]] sampling, generally by [[peritoneocentesis]] (also called ''laparocentesis''). It can be used for [[Cytopathology|cytology]] to detect spread of [[gynecologic cancer]]s.

==By component of interest==
The sampled matter can be analyzed for various components, for example:
*[[Electrolytes]]
*[[Protein]]s
*[[Cell (biology)|cells]], such as [[white blood cell]]s in blood sampling
*Microbiological agents, such as bacteria or fungi

===Microbiological sampling===
[[File:Infektionsschutzzentrum im Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum, Köln-6306 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Demonstration of throat swab collection]]
''[[Medical microbiology|Microbiological]] sampling'' include:
*''Blood sampling'' for [[blood culture]]s, performed similarly as that for tests on the fluid itself above
*{{anchor|swab}}''Throat swab'' for [[throat culture]]. It is performed by applying a [[cotton swab]] to the surface of the [[throat]].
*{{anchor|brush}}Sampling of [[sputum]] from the [[lungs]] for [[sputum culture]]. It can be performed by special techniques of coughing, or by a ''protected specimen brush'' (PSB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''San Marino Scale''' is a suggested scale for assessing risks associated with [[Active SETI|deliberate transmissions from Earth]] aimed to possible [[extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial intelligent life]]. The scale evaluates the significance of transmissions from Earth as a function of signal intensity and information content. The scale was suggested by [[Iván Almár]] at a conference in [[San Marino]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="san-marino-scale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iaaseti.org/en/san-marino-scale/ |publisher=IAA SETI Permanent Study Group |title=The San Marino Scale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hecht |first1=Jeff |journal= Acta Astronautica|title=The San Marino Scale: A new analytical tool for assessing transmission risk |date=24 October 2006 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.04.012 |volume=60 |pages=57–59 |last2=Paulshuch |first2=H |issue=1 |bibcode=2007AcAau..60...57A}}

The radio output of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune is not considered in the model.
The San Marino Scale was subsequently adopted by the SETI Permanent Study Group of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] at its 2007 meeting in Hyderabad, India.

== Calculation ==
In the original presentation given by Almár, the San Marino Index, '''SMI''', of a given event is calculated as the sum of two terms.

:&lt;math&gt; SMI = I + C &lt;/math&gt;

The first term, '''I''', is based on the intensity of the signal relative to the background noise in the same frequency band. This term is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], and calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; I {{=}} \log_{10}\left(\frac {\text{signal intensity}} { \text{background intensity}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a signal which is 100 times more intense than the background noise at the same frequency and bandwidth would have an I value of two.

The second term, '''C''', is more subjective and relates to the content, aiming, timing, and character of the signal.&lt;ref name="quantifying"/&gt; A C rating of one is something like a stray radar pulse, lacking any information content and randomly directed. A C rating of five is a deliberate reply to an extraterrestrial signal.

[[File:Sarfus.DNABiochip.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|3D Sarfus image of a [[DNA]] [[biochip]].]]
'''Sarfus''' is an optical quantitative imaging technique based on the association of:
*an upright or inverted [[optical microscope]] in crossed polarization configuration and
*specific supporting plates – called surfs – on which the sample to observe is deposited.

Sarfus visualization is based on the perfect control of the reflection properties of polarized light on a surface, which leads to an increase in the axial sensitivity of [[optical microscope]] by a factor of around 100 without reducing its lateral resolution. Thus this new technique increases the sensitivity of standard [[optical microscope]] to a point that it becomes possible to directly visualize thin films (down to 0.3 micrometer) and isolated nano-objects in real-time, be it in air or in water.

==Principles==
[[File:Sarfus LBLayers.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|Observation with standard optical microscope between cross polarizers of [[Langmuir–Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett]] layers (bilayer thickness: 5.4 nm) on silicon wafer and on surf]]
[[File:Sarfus PolarisationState.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Light polarisation after reflexion on a surf (0) and on nanoscale sample on a surf (1).]]

A recent study on polarized light coherence leads to the development of new supports – the surfs – having contrast amplification properties for standard optical microscopy in cross polarizers mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ausserré D |author2=Valignat MP |journal=Nano Letters|year=2006|volume=6|pages=1384–1388|doi=10.1021/nl060353h|pmid=16834416|title=Wide-field optical imaging of surface nanostructures|issue=7|bibcode = 2006NanoL...6.1384A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of optical layers on an opaque or transparent substrate, these supports do not modify the light polarization after reflection even if the numerical aperture of the incident source is important. This property is modified when a sample is present on a surf, a non-null light component is then detected after the analyzer rendering the sample visible.

The performances of these supports are estimated from the measurement of the contrast (C) of the sample defines by: C = (I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/(I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) where I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represent the intensities reflected by the bare surf and by the analyzed sample on the surf, respectively. For a one nanometer-film thickness, the surfs display a contrast 200 times higher than on silicon wafer.

This high contrast increase allows the visualization with standard optical microscope of films with thicknesses down to 0.3&amp;nbsp;nm, as well as nano-objects (down to 2&amp;nbsp;nm diameter) and this, without any kind of sample labelling (neither fluorescence, nor radioactive marker). An illustration of the contrast enhance is given hereafter with the observation in optical microscopy between cross polarizers of a [[Langmuir–Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett]] structure on a silicon wafer and on a surf.

In addition to visualization, recent developments have allowed accessing to the thickness measurement of the analyzed sample. A colorimetric correspondence is carried out between a calibration standard made of nano-steps and the analyzed sample. Indeed, due to optical interference, a correlation exists between RGB (red, green, blue) parameters of the sample and its optical thickness. This leads to 3D-representation of the analyzed samples, the measurement of profile sections, roughness and other topological measurements.

==Experimental setup==
The experimental set-up is simple: the sample to be characterized is deposited by usual deposit techniques such as dip-coating, spin-coating, deposit pipette, evaporation... on a surf instead of the traditional microscope slide. The support is then placed on the microscope stage.

==Synergy with existing equipment==
The sarfus technique can be integrated in existing analysis equipment ([[atomic force microscope]] (AFM), [[Raman spectroscopy]], etc.) to add new functionalities, such as optical image, thickness measurement, kinetic study, and also for sample pre-localization to save time and consumables (AFM tips, etc.).

==Applications==
[[File:Sarfus ExamplesVisu.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Sarfus images of nanostructures: 1. Copolymer film microstructuration (73 nm), 2. Carbon nanotube bundles, 3. Lipid vesicles in aqueous solutions, 4. Nanopatterning of gold dots (50 nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).]]

==Advantages==
Optical microscopy has several advantages compared to the usual techniques of nanocharacterization. It is easy-to-use and directly visualizes the sample. The analysis in real-time allows kinetic studies (real-time crystallization, dewetting, etc.). The broad choice of magnification (2.5 to 100x) allows fields of view from several mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to a few tens µm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Observations can be performed in controlled atmosphere and temperature.

      <text bytes="4751" xml:space="preserve">The '''SAT Subject Test in Biology''' was the name of a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] given on [[biology]] by the [[College Board]]. A [[student]] chose whether to take the test depending upon [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools in which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests; and from 1995 until January 2005, they were known as SAT IIs. Of all [[SAT Subject Tests|SAT subject tests]], the Biology E/M test was the only SAT II that allowed the test taker a choice between the [[Ecology|ecological]] or [[Molecular biology|molecular]] tests. A set of 60 questions was taken by all test takers for Biology and a choice of 20 questions was allowed between either the E or M tests. This test was graded on a scale between 200 and 800. The average for Molecular is 630 while Ecological is 591.&lt;ref name=SATsubjectpercentile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/SubjTestPercentileRanks.pdf |title=SAT Subject Test Percentile Ranks |accessdate=July 28, 2008 |publisher=[[The College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 19 2021, [[College Board|the College Board]] discontinued all [[SAT Subject Tests|SAT Subject tests]], including the SAT Subject Test in Biology E/M. This was effective immediately in the United States, and the tests were to be phased out by the following summer for international students.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Anderson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/sat-ending-essay-subject-tests/2021/01/19/ac82cdd8-574a-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html College Board is scrapping SAT’s optional essay and subject tests], ''Washington Post'' (January 19, 2021).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=College Board Will No Longer Offer SAT Subject Tests or SAT with Essay – College Board Blog|url=https://blog.collegeboard.org/January-2021-sat-subject-test-and-essay-faq|access-date=2021-02-14|website=blog.collegeboard.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done as a response to changes in college admissions due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aspegren|first1=Elinor|title=Adjusting to 'new realities' in admissions process, College Board eliminates SAT's optional essay and subject tests|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/01/19/sat-eliminates-optional-essay-subject-tests-covid-19-college-board/4220933001/|website=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
This test had 80 multiple-choice questions that were to be answered in one hour. All questions had five answer choices. Students received one point for each correct answer, lost ¼ of a point for each incorrect answer, and received 0 points for questions left blank.&lt;ref name=SATHowtheTestIsScored&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/scores/understanding/howscored.html |title=SAT How the Test Is Scored |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |publisher=[[The College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student's score was based entirely on his or her performance in answering the multiple-choice questions.

The questions covered a broad range of topics in general biology. There were more specific questions related respectively on ecological concepts (such as population studies and general [[Ecology]]) on the E test and molecular concepts such as [[DNA]] structure, [[translation (genetics)|translation]], and biochemistry on the M test.&lt;ref name=SATsubjecttestinbiology/&gt;

==Preparation==
The College Board suggested a year-long course in [[biology]] at the college preparatory level, as well as a one-year course in [[algebra]], and [[laboratory|lab]] experience as preparation for the test. The test required understanding of biological data and concepts, science-related terms, and the ability to effectively synthesize and interpret data from charts, maps, and other [[visual media]].&lt;ref name=SATsubjecttestinbiology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/lc_two/bio/bio.html?bio|title=SAT Subject Test in Biology |accessdate=November 22, 2013 |publisher=[[The College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most questions from this test were derived from, or are similar to, the pre-2012 [[AP Biology]] multiple choice questions.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} By taking an [[Advanced Placement|AP class]] or a class with similar rigor, one's chances at doing well on this test should have improved.

'''Scaffolding''' is a technique used in [[bioinformatics]]. It is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EDAM Ontology of Bioinformatics Operations and Data Formats|url=http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1498?p=terms&amp;conceptid=operation_3216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Link together a non-contiguous series of genomic sequences into a scaffold, consisting of sequences separated by gaps of known length. The sequences that are linked are typically contiguous sequences corresponding to read overlaps.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;When creating a draft genome, individual reads of DNA are second assembled into [[contig]]s, which, by the nature of their assembly, have gaps between them. The next step is to then bridge the gaps between these [[contig]]s to create a scaffold.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waterston|first=Robert|year=2002|title=On the Sequencing of the Human Genome|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=99|issue=6|pages=3712–3716|doi=10.1073/pnas.042692499|pmid=11880605|pmc=122589|bibcode=2002PNAS...99.3712W|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done using either [[Optical mapping|optical mapping]] or mate-pair sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Flot|first1=Jean-François|last2=Marie-Nelly|first2=Hervé|last3=Koszul|first3=Romain|date=2015-10-07|title=Contact genomics: scaffolding and phasing (meta)genomes using chromosome 3D physical signatures|journal=FEBS Letters|volume=589|issue=20 Pt A|pages=2966–2974|doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.034|issn=1873-3468|pmid=25935414|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assembly software ==

The sequencing of the ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' genome marked the advent of scaffolding. That project generated a total of 140 contigs, which were oriented and linked using paired end reads. The success of this strategy prompted the creation of the software, Grouper, which was included in genome assemblers. Until 2001, this was the only scaffolding software.{{cn|date=February 2020}} After the [[Human Genome Project]] and Celera proved that it was possible to create a large draft genome, several other similar programs were created. Bambus was created in 2003 and was a rewrite of the original grouper software, but afforded researchers the ability to adjust scaffolding parameters. This software also allowed for optional use of other linking data, such as contig order in a reference genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pop|first1=Mihai|last2=Kosack|first2=Daniel S.|last3=Salzberg|first3=Steven L.|date=2004-01-01|title=Hierarchical Scaffolding With Bambus|journal=Genome Research|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=149–159|doi=10.1101/gr.1536204|issn=1088-9051|pmc=314292|pmid=14707177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithms used by assembly software are very diverse, and can be classified as based on iterative marker ordering, or graph based. Graph based applications have the capacity to order and orient over 10,000 markers, compared to the maximum 3000 markers capable of iterative marker applications.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fierst JL (2015) Using linkage maps to correct and scaffold de novo genome assemblies: methods, challenges, and computational tools. In: Frontiers in Genetics. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2015.00220/full&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 7 Apr 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms can be further classified as greedy, non greedy, conservative, or non conservative. Bambus uses a greedy algorithm, defined as such because it joins together contigs with the most links first. The algorithm used by Bambus 2 removes repetitive contigs before orienting and ordering them into scaffolds. SSPACE also uses a greedy algorithm that begins building its first scaffold with the longest contig provided by the sequence data. SSPACE is the most commonly cited assembly tool in biology publications, likely due to the fact that it is rated as a significantly more intuitive program to install and run than other assemblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = M | last2 = Newbold | first2 = C | last3 = Berriman | first3 = M | last4 = Otto | first4 = TD | year = 2014 | title = A comprehensive evaluation of assembly scaffolding tools | journal = Genome Biology | volume =  15| issue = 3| page =  R42| doi = 10.1186/gb-2014-15-3-r42 | pmid = 24581555 | pmc = 4053845 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been an advent of new kinds of assemblers capable of integrating linkage data from multiple types of linkage maps. ALLMAPS is the first of such programs and is capable of combining data from genetic maps, created using SNPs or recombination data, with physical maps such as optical or synteny maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = H | last2 = Zhang | first2 = X | last3 = Miao | first3 = C |display-authors=etal | year = 2015 | title = ALLMAPS: robust scaffold ordering based on multiple maps | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | page = 3 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-014-0573-1 | pmid = 25583564 | pmc = 4305236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software, like ABySS and SOAPdenovo, contain gap filling algorithms which, although they do not create any new scaffolds, serve to decrease the gap length between contigs of individual scaffolds. A standalone program, GapFiller, is capable of closing a larger amount of gaps, using less memory than gap filling algorithms contained within assembly programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boetzer | first1 = M | last2 = Pirovano | first2 = W | year = 2012 | title = Toward almost closed genomes with GapFiller | journal = Genome Biology | volume =  13| issue = 6| page =  R56| doi = 10.1186/gb-2012-13-6-r56 | pmid = 22731987 | pmc = 3446322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utturkar et al. investigated the utility of several different assembly software packages in combination with hybrid sequence data. They concluded that the ALLPATHS-LG and [[SPAdes (software)|SPAdes]] algorithms were superior to other assemblers in terms of the number of, maximum length of, and N50 length of contigs and scaffolds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utturkar | first1 = SM | last2 = Klingeman | first2 = DM | last3 = Land | first3 = ML |display-authors=etal | year = 2014 | title = Evaluation and validation of ''de novo'' and hybrid assembly techniques to derive high-quality genome sequences | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 30 | issue = 19| pages = 2709–2716 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu391 | pmid = 24930142 | pmc = 4173024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scaffolding and next generation sequencing ==

Most high-throughput, next generation sequencing platforms produce shorter read lengths compared to [[Sanger sequencing]]. These new platforms are able to generate large quantities of data in short periods of time, but until methods were developed for de novo assembly of large genomes from short read sequences, Sanger sequencing remained the standard method of creating a reference genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Ruiqiang|last2=Zhu|first2=Hongmei|last3=Ruan|first3=Jue|last4=Qian|first4=Wubin|last5=Fang|first5=Xiaodong|last6=Shi|first6=Zhongbin|last7=Li|first7=Yingrui|last8=Li|first8=Shengting|last9=Shan|first9=Gao|date=2017-02-09|title=De novo assembly of human genomes with massively parallel short read sequencing|journal=Genome Research|volume=20|issue=2|pages=265–272|doi=10.1101/gr.097261.109|issn=1088-9051|pmc=2813482|pmid=20019144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Illumina platforms are now able to generate mate pair reads with average lengths of 150bp, they were originally only able to generate reads of 75bp or less, which caused many people in the science community to doubt a reliable [[reference genome]] could ever be constructed with short read technology. The increased difficulty of contig and scaffold assembly associated with the new technologies has created a demand for powerful new computer programs and algorithms capable of making sense of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pareek|first1=Chandra Shekhar|last2=Smoczynski|first2=Rafal|last3=Tretyn|first3=Andrzej|date=2017-02-09|title=Sequencing technologies and genome sequencing|journal=Journal of Applied Genetics|volume=52|issue=4|pages=413–435|doi=10.1007/s13353-011-0057-x|issn=1234-1983|pmc=3189340|pmid=21698376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One strategy that incorporates high-throughput next generation sequencing is hybrid sequencing, wherein several sequencing technologies are used at different levels of coverage, so that they can complement each other with their respective strengths. The release of the SMRT platform, from Pacific Biosciences, marked the beginning of single molecule sequencing and long read tech. It has been shown that 80-100X coverage with SMRT technology, which generates average read with lengths of 5456bp, is usually sufficient to create a finished de novo assembly for prokaryotic organisms. When the funds for that level of coverage are not available to a researcher, they might decide to use a hybrid approach.

Goldberg et al. evaluated the effectiveness of combining high throughput pyrosequencing with traditional Sanger sequencing. They were able to greatly increase N50 contig length and decrease gap length, and even to close one microbial genome with this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldberg | first1 = Susanne M. D. |display-authors=etal | year = 2006| title = A Sanger/Pyrosequencing Hybrid Approach for the Generation of High-Quality Draft Assemblies of Marine Microbial Genomes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 30| pages = 11240–11245 | jstor=30049789 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0604351103 | pmid = 16840556 | pmc = 1544072 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..10311240G | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optical mapping ==
It has been shown that integration of linkage maps can aid de novo assemblies with long range, chromosome scale recombination data, without which, assemblies can be subject to macro ordering errors. Optical mapping is the process of immobilizing the DNA on a slide and digesting it with restriction enzymes. The fragment ends are then fluorescently tagged and stitched back together. For the last two decades, optical mapping has been prohibitively expensive, but recent advances in technology have reduced cost significantly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chaisson|first1=Mark|last2=Wilson|first2=Richard|last3=Eichler|first3=Evan|date=7 October 2015|title=Genetic variation and the de novo assembly of human genomes|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=16|issue=11|pages=627–640|doi=10.1038/nrg3933|pmid=26442640|pmc=4745987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scotobiology''' is the study of [[biology]] as directly and specifically affected by [[darkness]], as opposed to [[photobiology]], which describes the biological effects of [[light]].

==Overview==
The science of scotobiology gathers together under a single descriptive heading a wide range of approaches to the study of the biology of darkness.  This includes work on the effects of darkness on the behavior and [[metabolism]] of animals, plants, and [[microorganism|microbe]]s.  Some of this work has been going on for over a century, and lays the foundation for understanding the importance of dark [[night skies]], not only for humans but for all biological species.

The great majority of biological systems have evolved in a world of alternating day and night and have become irrevocably adapted to and dependent on the daily and seasonally changing patterns of light and darkness. Light is essential for many biological activities such as [[visual perception|sight]] and [[photosynthesis]].  These are the focus of the science of photobiology. But the presence of uninterrupted periods of darkness, as well as their alternation with light, is just as important to biological behaviour. Scotobiology studies the positive responses of [[systems biology|biological systems]] to the presence of darkness, and not merely the negative effects caused by the absence of light.

==Effects of darkness==
Many of the biological and behavioural activities of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s (including [[bird]]s and [[amphibian]]s), [[insect]]s, and [[microorganism]]s are either adversely affected by [[light pollution]] at night or can only function effectively either during or as the consequence of nightly darkness. Such activities include [[foraging]], [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] and [[social behavior]] in higher animals, amphibians, and insects, which are all affected in various ways if light pollution occurs in their environment.&lt;ref name="goering"/&gt; These are not merely photobiological phenomena; light pollution acts by interrupting critical dark-requiring processes. 
 
But perhaps the most important scotobiological phenomena relate to the regular periodic alternation of light and darkness. These include breeding behavior in a range of animals, the control of [[flower]]ing and the induction of winter [[dormancy]] in many plants, and the operational control of the human [[immune system]]. In many of these biological processes the critical point is the length of the dark period rather than that of the light. For example, "short-day" and "long-day" plants are, in fact, "long-night" and "short-night" respectively. That is to say, plants do not measure the length of the light period, but of the dark period.&lt;ref name="bidwell"&gt;Bidwell, R.G.S. 1979. Plant Physiology, MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of artificial light pollution &lt;ref name="rich"&gt;"Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting", edited by Catherine Rich and Travis Longcore, Published by Island Press, 2006, 458pp, {{ISBN|1-55963-129-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is that even brief periods of relatively bright light during the night may prevent plants or animals (including humans) from measuring the length of the dark period, and therefore from behaving in a normal or required manner. This is a critical aspect of scotobiology, and one of the major areas in the study of the responses of biological systems to darkness.

In discussing scotobiology, it is important to remember that darkness (the absence of light) is seldom absolute. An important aspect of any scotobiological phenomenon is the level and quality ([[wavelength]]) of light that is below the threshold of detection for that phenomenon and in any specific organism. This important variable in scotobiological studies is not always properly noted or examined. There are substantial levels of natural light pollution at night, of which [[moonlight]] is usually the strongest.  For example, plants that rely on night length to program their behaviour have the capacity to ignore full moonlight during an otherwise dark night. If this ability had not evolved, plants would not be able to respond to changing night-length for such behavioural programs as the initiation of flowering and the onset of dormancy. On the other hand, some animal behavioural patterns are strongly responsive to moonlight. It is thus most important in any scotobiological study to determine the threshold level of light that may be required to interfere with or negate the normal pattern of [[nocturnality|dark-night activity]].

==Etymology==
In 2003, at a symposium on the [[Ecology]] of the Night held in [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]], [[Canada]], discussion centered around the many effects of night-time [[light pollution]] on the [[biology]] of a wide range of organisms, but it went far beyond this in describing darkness as a biological imperative for the functioning of biological systems.&lt;ref name="goering"&gt;The Ecology of the Night. An International Symposium: Darkness as a Biological Imperative. Muskoka, Canada, 22–24 September 2003; Chair, Peter L.E. Goering. Proceedings are available online at www.muskokaheritage.org/ecology-night/&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations focused on the absolute requirement of darkness for many aspects of normal behaviour and metabolism of many organisms and for the normal progression of their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s. Because there was no suitable term to describe the Symposium's main focus, the term ''scotobiology'' was introduced.  The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''scotos'', σκότος, "dark," and relates to [[photobiology]], which describes the biological effects of light (φῶς, ''phos''; root: φωτ-, ''phot-''). The term scotobiology appears not to have been used previously, although related terms such as [[phototropism|skototropism]]&lt;ref name="strong"&gt;Strong, D.R. and Ray, T.S. (1975). Science 190, #4216, pp 804–806.&lt;/ref&gt; and scotophyle&lt;ref name="bunning"&gt;Work of E. Bunning reported in (4), also of K.C. Hamner, reviewed in Evans, L.T. (1963). Environmental Control of Plant Growth, Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared in the literature.

In [[ecology]], '''scramble competition''' (or '''complete symmetric competition''' or '''exploitation competition''') refers to a situation in which a resource is accessible to all [[biological competition|competitors]] (that is, it is not monopolizable by an individual or group). However, since the particular resource is usually finite, scramble competition may lead to decreased [[survival rate]]s for all competitors if the resource is used to its [[carrying capacity]]. Scramble competition is also defined as "[a] [[finite resource]] [that] is shared equally amongst the competitors so that the quantity of food per individual declines with increasing [[population density]]".&lt;ref name="DenBerg"&gt;Den Berg, V., Rossing, W., and Grasman, J. (2006). "Contest and Scramble Competition and the Carry-Over Effect in Globodera spp. In Potato-Based Crop Rotations Using an Extended Ricker Model". Journal of Nematology, 38(2):210-220.&lt;/ref&gt; A further description of scramble competition is "competition for a resource that is inadequate for the needs of all, but which is partitioned equally among contestants, so that no competitor obtains the amount it needs and all would die in extreme cases."

==Types of intraspecific competition==
Researchers recognize two main forms of [[intraspecific competition]], where members of a species are all using a shared resource in short supply.&lt;ref name="Heying"&gt;{{cite web|work=Heying |year=2004 |title=Competition |url= http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/ftts/downloads/hehlect5.pdf |access-date= February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are contest competition and scramble competition.&lt;ref name="DenBerg"/&gt;

===Contest competition===
[[Contest competition]] is a form of competition where there is a winner and a loser and where resources can be attained completely or not at all. Contest competition sets up a situation where "each successful competitor obtains all resources it requires for survival or reproduction".&lt;ref name="DenBerg"/&gt; Here "contest" refers to the fact that physical action plays an active role in securing the resource. Contest competition involves resources that are stable, i.e. food or mates. Contests can be for a ritual objective such as territory or status, and losers may return to the competition another day to try again.&lt;ref name="Loki"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=loki.stockton.edu|author=&lt;!-- (n.d) --&gt; |title=Intraspecific Competition and Social Systems |url= http://loki.stockton.edu/~cromartj/populationbio/socialsystems.htm| access-date= February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scramble competition===
In scramble competition resources are limited, which may lead to group member [[starvation]].&lt;ref name="Loki"/&gt;
Contest competition is often the result of aggressive social domains, including hierarchies or [[social chain]]s.&lt;ref name="Berryman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berryman|first= Alan |year=1997|title=Intraspecific Competition|url= http://classes.entom.wsu.edu/529/IntraCompet.htm |website=classes.entom.wsu.edu |access-date= February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, scramble competition is what occurs by accident when competitors naturally want the same resources.&lt;ref name="Berryman"/&gt;  These two forms of competition can be interwoven into one another. Some researchers have noted parallels between intraspecific behaviors of competition and cooperation.&lt;ref name="Berryman"/&gt; These two processes can be evolutionarily adopted and they can also be accidental, which makes sense given the aggressive competition and collaborative cooperation aspects of social behavior in humans and animals.&lt;ref name="Berryman"/&gt; To date, few studies have looked at the interplay between contest and scramble competition, despite the fact that they do not occur in isolation.  There appears to be little understanding of the interface between contest competition and scramble competition in insects.&lt;ref name="Rank"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rank | first1 = N. E. | last2 = Yturralde | first2 = K. | last3 = Dahlhoff | first3 = E. P. | doi = 10.1007/s10905-006-9051-2 | title = Role of Contests in the Scramble Competition Mating System of a Leaf Beetle | journal = Journal of Insect Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 699 | year = 2006 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.419.6609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much research still needs to be conducted concerning the overlap of contest and scramble competition systems.&lt;ref name="Rank"/&gt; Contests can arise within a scramble competition system and conversely, scramble competition "may play a role in a system characterized by interference".&lt;ref name="Rank"/&gt;

==Population effects==
[[Population]] can be greatly affected by scramble competition (and contest competition). [[Intraspecific]] competition normally leads to a decline of organisms.&lt;ref name="Berryman"/&gt; For example, the more time that an individual spends seeking food and reproduction opportunities, the less energy that organism naturally has to defend oneself against predators, resulting in a "[[zero-sum game]]".&lt;ref name="Heying" /&gt; Competition is a density dependent effect, and scramble competition is no exception. Scramble competition usually involves interactions among individuals of the same species, which makes competition balanced and often leads to a decline of population growth rate as the amount of resources depletes.&lt;ref name="Sharov"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharov |first= Alexei |year=1997|title=11.1 Intra-specific Competition |url=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/popecol/lec11/intra.html |website=ma.utexas.edu|access-date= February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ricker model|Ricker Model]],&lt;ref name="DenBerg"/&gt; is used to model scramble competition. It was originally formulated to study the growth of [[salmon]] populations and is given by the equation P&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; = R(P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;r(1-P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/k)&lt;/sup&gt;, where P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the population at the nth time period, r is the [[Malthusian growth|Malthusian growth rate]], and k is the carrying capacity of the population. The Ricker model, and a few other well-known population models, can be explicitly derived from individual-level processes assuming scramble competition and a random distribution of individuals among resources.&lt;ref name="Brannstrom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brännström |first1= A. |last2=Sumpter |first2=DJT |year=2005 |title=The role of competition and clustering in population dynamics |url=http://www.math.uu.se/~david/web/BrannstromSumpter05a.pdf |work=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 275:2065-2072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have noted that in certain species, such as the [[horseshoe crab]], males are most successful at mating when they are able to practice scramble competition polygyny where they do not defend their territory but rather mate and move on, thus providing the highest likelihood of species survival and reproductive prowess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=faculty.vassar.edu |author=&lt;!-- n.d. --&gt;|title=Polygyny|url= http://faculty.vassar.edu/suter/1webistes/bejones/mateseleciton/files/polygyny.htm |access-date= February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
There are many examples of scramble competition within the environment.  For example, [[cow]]s grazing in a grassland could be operating under a scramble competition.   This illustration of cows eating grass is scramble competition because there are limited resources, there is only so much grass to be eaten before all the food resource is depleted.  Additionally, there is no way that others can limit the amount of resources or the access to resources that the other cows receive.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite web|website=life.bio.sunysb.edu |author= &lt;!-- n.d. --&gt;|title=Social Relationships |url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/bio359/4_26_02.html |access-date= February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example of scramble competition is forest defoliators.  If their larvae can find shelter and food then survival is possible, but when all the foliage is destroyed then the population decreases.  Their synchronized life cycle increases competition for specific resources; this greatly affects their ability to receive resources including food and shelter due to the overwhelming population increase at certain times of the year.&lt;ref name="Sharov"/&gt; 
 
[[File:red-spotted newt (N. v. viridescens).jpg|thumb|The [[Eastern newt|red spotted newt]] exhibits [[sexual dimorphism]]]]
Scramble competition can also be seen with the example of [[eastern newt|red spotted newts]]. [[Charles Darwin]] (1871) first explored the concept of "[[sexual dimorphism]]" which states that, "most sexually dimorphic species are also the most polygynous" which would enable males to "outcompete other males through female choice, combat, or scrambles to encounter females would be favored by selection, and sexual dimorphism would result".&lt;ref name="able"&gt;Able, D. (1999). "Scramble competition selects for greater tailfin size in male red-spotted news (Amphibia:Salmandriade)" Behavior Ecological Sociobiological 46: 423-428.&lt;/ref&gt; The key to red-spotted newts increased success in scramble competition is the newts enhanced or strengthened tailfins.&lt;ref name="able"/&gt; 

Another example of scramble competition is the success of small [[beetle]]s over large beetles.&lt;ref name="MoyaLarano"&gt;MoyaLarano, J., Tigani El-Sayyid, M., and Fox, C. (2007). "Smaller beetles are better scramble competitors at cooler temperatures". Biol Lett. 22; 3(5): 475-478.&lt;/ref&gt; While larger beetles, similar to larger animals in general, tend to win more often in contest competition, the opposite can be true in a scramble competition.&lt;ref name="MoyaLarano"/&gt; Specifically with beetles, scramble competition is dependent on male movement and locomotion so that the beetle that can move faster is more likely to be successful in attaining resources, mates and food. Smaller beetles fare better in scramble competition for shelter, which could one day lead to the evolutionary adaptation of smaller beetle structures for survival purposes. The flux of contest and scramble competition in this example is important to note because it truly depends on the context of each individual to determine which type of competition is most suitable.

Scramble competition also exists in [[lepidoptera]]ns. For example, male [[mourning cloak]] butterflies will fly around in search for widely dispersed females.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, N., Krebs, J., &amp; West, S. (2012). An introduction to behavioral ecology. (4th ed.). West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of scramble competition exists in [[Latrodectus hesperus|Lactrodectus hesperus]], the western black widow spider. There is a male-bias or skew within the sexually active population of this species, which means that females are a finite "resource". So, while no male has a monopoly over the females, the males who reach the female first will come out on top in the world of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Łomnicki|first=A.|title=Competition and Behavior|date=2008-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080454054000057|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Ecology|pages=695–700|editor-last=Jørgensen|editor-first=Sven Erik|place=Oxford|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|isbn=978-0-08-045405-4|access-date=2020-12-14|editor2-last=Fath|editor2-first=Brian D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="10419" xml:space="preserve">SEA-PHAGES stands for '''Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science'''; it was formerly called the National Genomics Research Initiative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was the first initiative launched by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] (HHMI) Science Education Alliance (SEA) by their director [[Tuajuanda C. Jordan]] in 2008 to improve the retention of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hhmi.org/developing-scientists/science-education-alliance|title=Science Education Alliance {{!}} HHMI.org|website=www.hhmi.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEA-PHAGES is a two-semester undergraduate research program administered by the [[University of Pittsburgh|University of Pittsburgh's]] [[Graham Hatfull]]'s group and the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute|Howard Hughes Medical Institute's]] Science Education Division. Students from over 100 universities nationwide engage in authentic individual research that includes a [[Wet lab|wet-bench laboratory]] and a [[bioinformatics]] component.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seaphages.org/|title=SEA-PHAGES|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum ==
During the first semester of this program, classes of around 18-24 undergraduate students work under the supervision of one or two university faculty members and a graduate student assistant—who have completed two week-long training workshops—to isolate and characterize their own personal [[bacteriophage]] that infects a specific bacterial host cell from local soil samples.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan TC, Burnett SH, Carson S, Caruso SM, Clase K, DeJong RJ, Dennehy JJ, Denver DR, Dunbar D, Elgin SC, Findley AM, Gissendanner CR, Golebiewska UP, Guild N, Hartzog GA, Grillo WH, Hollowell GP, Hughes LE, Johnson A, King RA, Lewis LO, Li W, Rosenzweig F, Rubin MR, Saha MS, Sandoz J, Shaffer CD, Taylor B, Temple L, Vazquez E, Ware VC, Barker LP, Bradley KW, Jacobs-Sera D, Pope WH, Russell DA, Cresawn SG, Lopatto D, Bailey CP, Hatfull GF | display-authors = 6 | title = A broadly implementable research course in phage discovery and genomics for first-year undergraduate students | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e01051-13 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24496795 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.01051-13 | pmc = 3950523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once students have successfully isolated a phage, they are able to classify them by visualizing them through [[Electron microscope|Electron microscope (EM) images]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, [[DNA]] is extracted and purified by the students, and one sample is sent for sequencing to be ready for the second semester's curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second semester consists of the annotation of the [[genome]] the class sent to be sequenced. In that case, students work together to evaluate the genes for start-stop coordinates, [[ribosome-binding site]]s, and possible functions of those [[protein]]s in which the sequence codes. Once the annotation is completed, it is submitted to the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]'s (NCBI) DNA sequence database [[GenBank]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If there is still time in the semester or the sent DNA was not able to be sequenced, the class could request genome file from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] that had yet to be sequenced. In addition to the laboratory and bioinformatic skills acquired, students have the opportunity to publish their work in academic journals and attend the national SEA-PHAGES conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] or a regional symposium.

== Online Databases and Bioinformatic Programs Used ==

=== PhagesDB ===
All of the details regarding each student's phage is made public by entering it into the online database [[PhagesDB]] to expand the knowledge of the SEA-PHAGES community as a whole.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=Daniel A.|last2=Hatfull|first2=Graham|date=December 6, 2016|title=PhagesDB: the actinobacteriophage database|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=33|issue=5|pages=784–786|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btw711|pmid=28365761|pmc=5860397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Starterator ====
Starterator creates a report by comparing the called start sites of genes in the same Pham in annotated phage genomes and other drafts; therefore, students can suggest an appropriate start for the auto-annotated genes in their actinobacteriophage genome.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is not usually a primary source for calling a gene start because it is not always supported by the information from other programs or the start-stop coordinates are not the same for a gene called by DNA Master.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Local Blast and Blastp ====
These compare the amino acid sequence of a gene to other sequenced or annotated phage genomes within the database for students in the SEA-PHAGES community to predict starts and functions of their proteins.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phagesdb.org/|title=The Actinobacteriophage Database {{!}} Home|website=phagesdb.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GeneMark ====
This software generates a report with its algorithm that shows the coding potential for the six possible open reading frames of a specific genome, so the probability of a gene's existence can be assessed during annotation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== DNA Master ===
DNA Master is a free software tool that students can download on a Windows computer that utilizes the programs [[GLIMMER]], [[GeneMark]], Aragorn, and tRNAscan-SE to auto-annotate a genome that is uploaded as a [[FASTA format]] file.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since this is done by a computer algorithm that only uses three programs and may not be as updated as the online versions, each suggested gene has to be confirmed by student annotations. These go through several rounds of peer-review before it is accepted to be reviewed by experts from PhagesDB, then it can be submitted to [[GenBank]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== GLIMMER ====
These programs are used by DNA Master to predict the starts of the genes by assessing the probability of the six open reading frames (ORFs) and the ribosome binding site (RBS) signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelley DR, Liu B, Delcher AL, Pop M, Salzberg SL | title = Gene prediction with Glimmer for metagenomic sequences augmented by classification and clustering | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = e9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22102569 | pmc = 3245904 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, [[GLIMMER]] and [[GeneMark]] agree on the predictions during the auto-annotation, but sometimes they give different starts which have to be assessed during manual annotation; GLIMMER is currently the most updated software and is usually used for the final start coordinate.

==== Aragorn ====
This algorithm is utilized by DNA Master, and there is an online version that can be used to cross-reference the calls made by the software.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It shows definitive [[Transfer RNA|tRNAs]] and [[Transfer-messenger RNA|tmRNAs]] within a genome by looking for very specific sequences that would fold into the distinctive cloverleaf secondary structure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laslett D, Canback B | title = ARAGORN, a program to detect tRNA genes and tmRNA genes in nucleotide sequences | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–6 | date = 2004 | pmid = 14704338 | pmc = 373265 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this algorithm is considered very accurate considering how fast it produces results, it can miss some tRNAs that are not exactly within its search parameters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== tRNAscan-SE ====
This program allows students the ability to identify possible coding regions for tRNAs in sequence that would have been missed by Aragorn because it includes detection for unusual tRNA homologues; although, both programs have sensitivities between 99-100%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowe TM, Eddy SR | title = tRNAscan-SE: a program for improved detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 955–64 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9023104 | pmc = 146525 | doi=10.1093/nar/25.5.955}}&lt;/ref&gt; tRNAscan-SE does not detect tRNAs itself, but instead outputs the results of the information processed from three independent tRNA prediction programs: tRNAscan, EufindtRNA, and tRNA covariance model search.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Phamerator ===
Phamerator shows a visual representation of the genes and their similarity to other selected phage genomes by marking them with colored rectangles based on the Phamily or Pham it groups it in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Students can then view, compare, save, and print color-coded genome maps during their annotations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Possible insertions or deletions can be seen through connecting lines between the selected phage genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cresawn SG, Bogel M, Day N, Jacobs-Sera D, Hendrix RW, Hatfull GF | title = Phamerator: a bioinformatic tool for comparative bacteriophage genomics | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 12 | pages = 395 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21991981 | pmc = 3233612 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-12-395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the nucleotide and protein sequences can be accessed through this program; however, the starts and stops do not always match that of DNA Master so the sequences may be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phamerator.org/|title=Phamerator|website=phamerator.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCBI Blast and HHPred ===
These online programs are used to predict the functions of proteins by comparison of the amino acid or nucleotide sequences of all genomes sequenced, not just that of phages. HHPred detects homology in the sequences with other proteins that have had their functions called in any organism.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Also, if the protein has been identified in another sequence, the computer-generated structure might be provided to visualize the possible folding of the amino acids.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhpred|title=Bioinformatics Toolkit|website=toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seaport Centre''' is a [[high-tech]] [[business park]] located in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[California]], United States, and as of 2007 is one of the largest biotechnology research complexes in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

The property consists of {{convert|623000|sqft|m2|-2}} of developed building area, and is situated in proximity to the [[Port of Redwood City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cutland|first1=Laura|title=Peninsula biotech gets a boost|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2005/07/11/story1.html|publisher=Silicon Valley Business Journal|accessdate=6 December 2016|date=7 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property is classified as [[Class A office space]] and is constructed as a series of separate buildings.  The original lands of the Seaport Centre were used as [[salt evaporation pond]]s on tidal lands of the [[San Francisco Bay]], a land use that started sometime prior to 1940. As of 2002 leasing rates at Seaport Centre were in the range of $27 per square foot  per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ginsberg|first1=Steve|title=Low-profile projects help Catellus in `lumpy' 2002|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2002/02/25/newscolumn5.html|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=San Francisco Business Times|date=24 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[Slough Estates]], a United Kingdom-based [[REIT]], purchased the entirety of Seaport Centre to develop it as a [[biotechnology]] research center to compete with the existing biotech hubs in [[Silicon Valley]] and [[South San Francisco]].

The Seaport Centre is located on generally level ground at approximately {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} above [[mean sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schemel|first1=Laurence E.|title=Supporting Data For Hydrologic Studies in San Francisco Bay|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/ofr02231/OFR95-327.pdf|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=6 December 2016|date=June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stormwater [[surface runoff]] is pumped from Seaport Centre to discharge into [[Redwood Creek, San Mateo County|Redwood Creek]].

==Aerial photographic history==
Due to the large scale of this area and its historical lack of accessibility, the area history can be revealed well with aerial photographic records. In 1989, the firm of Earth Metrics Incorporated conducted a review of historic aerial photographs dating back to 1956.(Earth Metrics, 1989)  The Seaport Centre site and its environs, as of the 1956 aerial stereo photo, were essentially undeveloped, although extensive [[salt evaporation pond]]s were evident on site.  Redwood City Planning Department records confirm that the site was used for salt evaporation since sometime prior to [[World War II]].

Analysis of five sets of time staged stereo pairs of aerial photos reveal that the Seaport Centre site remained undeveloped until 1982; up until that time, city records show that the site was zoned as "Tidal Plain", a designation not allowing urban development.  Area land use gradually changed from 1956 until 1982, in the form of gradual building development in the local area.  As early as 1956 a [[rail tracks|rail spur]] is evident, which served the loading of raw [[sea salt]] for export from the area.  No [[agriculture|agricultural]] history is associated with the site, other than the [[salt]] harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Conomos | first=T. John | title=San Francisco Bay : The Urbanized Estuary | publisher=The Division | location=San Francisco, Calif | year=1979 | isbn=0-934394-01-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/sanfranciscobayu00conorich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Since development of Seaport Centre in the early 1980s there has been a consistent trend of the property's use as a research and development hub for the biotech industry. In a 1989 tenant survey, some of the principal tenants present were: Vascualar Interventions Inc., Genelabs Incorporated, Precision Images Inc., Invitron, Charles Evans Inc., ICT Corporation, Resound Incorporated, Ideon Corporation, [[Cygnus_Inc|Cygnus Research Corp]], Color Prep, Aurora Systems Inc., [[Ross_Video|Abekas Video Systems Inc.]], [[Personics|Personics Inc.]], Instor Corporation and Visucom, Inc.

A number of these early firms utilized a variety of [[hazardous material]]s in their normal processes.  These substances included a variety of toxic [[solvent]]s and other [[organic chemical]]s such as [[acetone]], [[benzene]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]] and [[toluene]].  Use of such chemicals on site is considered a risk, since the [[brackish]] groundwater at the Seaport Centre is shallow.

Current tenants still largely focus on the medical and health fields and include: AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, [[Bavarian Nordic]], [[Codexis]], [[Genomic Health]], Guardant Health, Gynesonics, Minerva Surgical, [[OncoMed]], [[Stem Cell Theranostics]], and [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]].

'''SeaSeep''' is a combination of 2D seismic data (a group of seismic lines acquired individually, as opposed to multiple closely space lines&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;),  high resolution multibeam sonar which is an evolutionary advanced form of [[side-scan sonar]], navigated piston coring (one of the more common sea floor sampling methods&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), heat flow sampling (which serve a critical purpose in oil exploration and production&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and possibly gravity and magnetic data (refer to Dick Gibson's  Primer on Gravity and Magnetics&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).

The term SeaSeep originally belonged to Black Gold Energy LLC&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and refers to a dataset that combines all of the available data into one integrated package that can be used in [[hydrocarbon exploration]]. With the acquisition of Black Gold Energy LLC by Niko Resources Ltd.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; in December 2009 the term now belongs to [[Niko Resources]]

The concept of a SeaSeep dataset is the modern day offshore derivative of how many oil fields were found in the late 19th and early 20th century;  by finding a large [[anticline]] structure with an associated oil seep. In the [[United States]], many of the first commercial fields in [[California]] were found using this method including the Newhall Field discovered in 1876 and the Kern River Field discovered in 1899&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Seeps have also been used to find offshore fields including the [[Cantarell Field]] in [[Mexico]] in 1976; the largest oil field in [[Mexico]] and one of the largest in the world.  The field is named after a fisherman, Rudesindo Cantarell, who complained to [[PEMEX]] about his fishing nets being stained by oil seeps in the [[Bay of Campeche]].

The biological and geochemical manifestations of seepage leads to distinct bathymetrical features including positive relief mounds, pinnacles, [[mud volcano]]es and negative relief [[pockmark (geology)|pockmark]]s. These features can be detected by multibeam sonar and then sampled by navigated piston coring. Spec and proprietary multibeam [[seep]] mapping and core geochemistry by Texas A&amp;M University's Geochemical &amp; Environmental Research Group&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and later TDI Brooks&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; demonstrated thermogenic charge in deepwater [[Angola]] and deepwater [[Nigeria]] leading to an aggressive exploration program by a number of oil companies and subsequent discoveries. The emphasis on, and marketplace acceptance of, multibeam mapping combined with navigated coring as an improvement over grid-based approaches to geochemical exploration is attributed to AOA Geophysics Inc&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{Biological classification}}

In [[biology]] a '''section''' ({{lang-la|sectio}}) is a [[taxonomic rank]] that is applied differently in [[botany]] and [[zoology]].

==In botany==
{{Main|Section (botany)}}
Within flora (plants), 'section' refers to a ''botanical'' rank below the genus, but above the species:
* [[domain (biology)|Domain]] &gt; [[kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] &gt; [[division (botany)|Division]] &gt; [[class (biology)|Class]] &gt; [[order (biology)|Order]] &gt; [[family (biology)|Family]] &gt; [[tribe (biology)|Tribe]] &gt; [[Genus]] &gt; Subgenus &gt; '''[[Section (botany)|Section]]''' &gt; Subsection &gt; [[Species]]

==In zoology==
Within fauna (animals), 'section' refers to a ''zoological'' rank below the order, but above the family:

* [[domain (biology)|Domain]] &gt; [[kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] &gt; [[Phylum]] &gt; [[class (biology)|Class]] &gt; [[order (biology)|Order]] &gt; '''Section''' &gt; [[family (biology)|Family]] &gt; [[tribe (biology)|Tribe]] &gt; [[Genus]] &gt; [[Species]]

==In bacteriology==
The [[International Code of Nomenclature for Bacteria]] states that the Section rank is an informal one, between the subgenus and species (as in botany).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8808/ |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria: Bacteriological Code, 1990 Revision |chapter = Chapter 3, Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations, Rule 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selection and amplification binding assay (SAAB)''' is a [[molecular biology]] technique typically used to find the [[DNA]] binding site for [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="Blackwell_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell TK, Weintraub H | title = Differences and similarities in DNA-binding preferences of MyoD and E2A protein complexes revealed by binding site selection | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4984 | pages = 1104–10 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2174572 | doi = 10.1126/science.2174572 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1104B }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[T. Keith Blackwell]] and [[Harold M. Weintraub]] in 1990.

== Method ==

SAAB experimental procedure consists of several steps, depending upon the knowledge available about the binding site. A typical SAAB consists of the following steps:

# Synthesis of template with random sequence in binding site: three situations are possible: (i) when both the binding site and the protein are known and available; (ii) when only a consensus binding site is available and the binding protein is not; and (iii) when the protein is available, but the binding site is unknown. When the binding site is not known, the number of random nucleotide positions in the template must be large.
# Incubate labeled double stranded template with protein: usually the protein has to be synthesized in a host cell with fusion techniques. Longer incubation time and large quantity are provided in case of an unspecific binding site.&lt;ref name="Amendt_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amendt BA, Sutherland LB, Russo AF | title = Transcriptional antagonism between Hmx1 and Nkx2.5 for a shared DNA-binding site | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 17 | pages = 11635–42 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10206974 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.17.11635 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Isolate the DNA bound protein by EMSA: the DNA bound protein, migrated in acrylamide gel, is isolated by autoradiography as per an [[Electrophoretic mobility shift assay]] (EMSA) protocol.&lt;ref name="Rienhoff_1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rienhoff HY | title = Identification of a transcriptional enhancer in a mouse amyloid gene | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 264 | issue = 1 | pages = 419–25 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(17)31274-7 | pmid = 2909529 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/264/1/419.full.pdf | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Amplify the bound template by PCR. For positive control, amplify the starting template also; The bound DNA is isolated via gel excision, purified, and amplified using PCR.
# Label amplified binding site and reselect for binding by EMSA. Precede the binding step at least for 5 times with the amplified labeled DNA sample and fusion protein.
# [[DNA sequencing|Sequence the DNA]]: After final step of selection and electrophoresis, clone the DNA into a cloning vector and sequence it. Originally Blackwell used Pyro sequencing, which can be replaced by modern techniques.&lt;ref name="Kim_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TG, Kraus JC, Chen J, Lee Y | title = JUMONJI, a critical factor for cardiac development, functions as a transcriptional repressor | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 43 | pages = 42247–55 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12890668 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M307386200 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications  ==

=== Quox homeodomain  ===

Quox1 is a [[homeobox]] gene involved in the regulation of patterns of development ([[morphogenesis]]) in animals, fungi and plants and was originally isolated from cDNA library of five week [[quail]] embryo. It is the only gene in the hox family that has been found to express in both [[prosencephalon]] and [[mesencephalon]] involved in the differentiation of the central and peripheral nerve cells. The optimal DNA binding site for Quox1 or its mammalian homologs was identified by SAAB in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;not sourced [6]&lt;/ref&gt; The amplified Quox1  DNA fragment obtained from PCR amplification from a human embryo cDNA librarywas digested with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into the SmaI and XhoI restriction site of the expression vector pGEMEXxBal. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 and Quox1 fusion proteins were isolated by chromatographic techniques.

The radio labeled probe was incubated with 25 pmol of purified Quox1 homeodomain fusion protein in binding buffer for EMSA. The protein bound DNA was detected by autoradiography, and the bands representing protein–DNA complexes were excised from the gel and the eluted DNA were amplified by PCR using primers complementary to the 20 bp nonrandom flanking sequences. After 5 set of the same procedure, the purified DNA was cloned into pMD 18T and sequenced. Finally the sequence {{DNA sequence|CAATC}} was identified as the consensus binding sequence for Quox1 homeodomain.

=== Screening ===

By combining the power of random-sequence selection with pooled sequencing, the SAAB imprint assay makes possible simultaneous screening of a large number of binding site mutants.&lt;ref&gt;not sourced [7]&lt;/ref&gt; SAAB also allows the identification of sites with high relative binding affinity since the competition is inherent in the protocol. It can also identify site positions that are neutral or specific bases that can interfere with binding, such as a T at - 4 in the E47 half-site.&lt;ref&gt;not sourced [8]&lt;/ref&gt; We can apply the technique to less affinity binding sequence also, provided to keep high concentration of binding protein at each step of binding. It is also possible to identify the binding site even if both the protein and sequence is not known.&lt;ref name="Blackwell_1990" /&gt;

'''Selective breeding''' (also called '''artificial selection''') is the process by which humans use [[animal breeding]] and [[plant breeding]] to [[Selection (biology)|selectively]] develop particular [[phenotypic trait]]s (characteristics) by choosing which typically [[animal]] or [[plant]] males and females will [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproduce]] and have [[offspring]] together. [[Domestication|Domesticated]] animals are known as [[breed]]s, normally bred by a professional [[breeder]], while domesticated plants are known as [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], [[cultigen]]s, [[cultivar]]s, or breeds.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/breed (Noun definition 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a [[crossbreed]], and crossbred plants are called [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.

In [[animal breeding]], techniques such as [[inbreeding]], [[linebreeding]], and [[outcrossing]] are utilized. In [[plant breeding]], similar methods are used. [[Charles Darwin]] discussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time in his 1859 book, ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Its first chapter discusses selective breeding and [[domestication]] of such animals as [[pigeon]]s, [[cat]]s, [[cattle]], and [[dog]]s. Darwin used artificial selection as a springboard to introduce and support the theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin&lt;/ref&gt;

The deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology.

Selective breeding can be unintentional, for example, resulting from the process of human cultivation; and it may also produce unintended – desirable or undesirable – results. For example, in some grains, an increase in seed size may have resulted from certain ploughing practices rather than from the intentional selection of larger seeds. Most likely, there has been an interdependence between natural and artificial factors that have resulted in plant domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature07895| title=The nature of selection during plant domestication| journal=Nature| volume=457| issue=7231| pages=843–8| year=2009| last1=Purugganan | first1=M.

==History==
Selective breeding of both plants and animals has been practiced since early [[prehistory]]; key species such as [[wheat]], [[rice]], and [[dog]]s have been significantly different from their wild ancestors for millennia, and [[maize]], which required especially large changes from [[teosinte]], its wild form, was selectively bred in [[Mesoamerica]]. Selective breeding was practiced by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Buffum, Burt C. |title=Arid Agriculture; A Hand-Book for the Western Farmer and Stockman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rmbur_Am8vgC&amp;pg=PA232|date=2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4086-6710-1|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatises as much as 2,000 years old give advice on selecting animals for different purposes, and these ancient works cite still older authorities, such as [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago the Carthaginian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lush, Jay L. |title=Animal Breeding Plans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KA-4oOQLgP8C&amp;pg=PA21|date= 2008|publisher=Orchard Press|isbn=978-1-4437-8451-1|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of selective breeding was later expressed by the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muslim]] [[polymath]] [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] in the 11th century. He noted the idea in his book titled ''India'', which included various examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/348801| title = On the Presumed Darwinism of Alberuni Eight Hundred Years before Darwin| journal = Isis| volume = 50| issue = 4| pages = 459–466| year = 1959| last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = J.

Selective breeding was established as a scientific practice by [[Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)|Robert Bakewell]] during the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] in the 18th century.  Arguably, his most important breeding program was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln Longwool]] was improved by Bakewell, and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was [[Polled livestock|hornless]] and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Bakewell (1725–1795)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/bakewell_robert.shtml|publisher=BBC History|access-date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sheep were exported widely, including to [[Australia]] and [[North America]], and have contributed to numerous modern breeds, despite the fact that they fell quickly out of favor as market preferences in meat and textiles changed. Bloodlines of these original New Leicesters survive today as the [[English Leicester]] (or Leicester Longwool), which is primarily kept for wool production.

Bakewell was also the first to breed cattle to be used primarily for beef. Previously, cattle were first and foremost kept for pulling [[plough]]s as [[oxen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trail of the Viking Finger|last=Bean|first=John|publisher=Troubador Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1785893056|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, but he crossed long-horned heifers and a Westmoreland bull to eventually create the [[English Longhorn|Dishley Longhorn]]. As more and more farmers followed his lead, farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality. In 1700, the average weight of a [[bull]] sold for slaughter was 370 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (168&amp;nbsp;kg). By 1786, that weight had more than doubled to 840 pounds (381&amp;nbsp;kg). However, after his death, the Dishley Longhorn was replaced with short-horn versions.

He also bred the Improved Black Cart horse, which later became the [[Shire horse]].

[[Charles Darwin]] coined the term 'selective breeding'; he was interested in the process as an illustration of his proposed wider process of [[natural selection]]. Darwin noted that many domesticated animals and plants had special properties that were developed by intentional [[animal husbandry|animal and]] [[plant breeding]] from individuals that showed desirable characteristics, and discouraging the breeding of individuals with less desirable characteristics.

Darwin used the term "artificial selection" twice in the 1859 first edition of his work ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', in Chapter IV: Natural Selection, and in Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory:

{{quote|Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the co-adaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, p.

==Animal breeding==
{{Main|Animal breeding}}

Animals with homogeneous appearance, behavior, and other characteristics are known as particular breeds or pure breeds, and they are bred through [[culling]] animals with particular traits and selecting for further breeding those with other traits. [[Purebred]] animals have a single, recognizable breed, and purebreds with recorded lineage are called [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]d. [[Crossbreed]]s are a mix of two purebreds, whereas [[mixed breed]]s are a mix of several breeds, often unknown. Animal breeding begins with breeding stock, a group of animals used for the purpose of planned breeding. When individuals are looking to breed animals, they look for certain valuable traits in purebred stock for a certain purpose, or may intend to use some type of [[crossbreeding]] to produce a new type of stock with different, and, it is presumed, superior abilities in a given area of endeavor. For example, to breed chickens, a breeder typically intends to receive eggs, meat, and new, young birds for further reproduction. Thus, the breeder has to study different breeds and types of chickens and analyze what can be expected from a certain set of characteristics before he or she starts breeding them. Therefore, when purchasing initial breeding stock, the breeder seeks a group of birds that will most closely fit the purpose intended.

Purebred breeding aims to establish and maintain stable traits, that animals will pass to the next generation. By "breeding the best to the best," employing a certain degree of [[inbreeding]], considerable culling, and selection for "superior" qualities, one could develop a bloodline superior in certain respects to the original base stock. Such animals can be recorded with a [[breed registry]], the organization that maintains [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s and/or [[stud book]]s. However, single-trait breeding, breeding for only one trait over all others, can be problematic.&lt;ref name="grandin69"&gt;{{cite book|title= Animals in Translation|last= Grandin|first= Temple|author-link= Temple Grandin|author2= Johnson, Catherine|year= 2005|publisher= Scribner|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-7432-4769-6|pages= [https://archive.org/details/animalsintransla00gran/page/69 69–71]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/animalsintransla00gran/page/69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case mentioned by animal behaviorist [[Temple Grandin]], [[rooster]]s bred for fast growth or heavy muscles did not know how to perform typical rooster courtship dances, which alienated the roosters from hens and led the roosters to kill the hens after mating with them.&lt;ref name="grandin69"/&gt; A Soviet attempt to breed lab rats with higher intelligence led to cases of neurosis severe enough to make the animals incapable of any problem solving unless drugs like [[phenazepam]] were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.znanie-sila.ru/golden/issue2print_9.html |title=Жили-были крысы |access-date=9 August 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140809185752/http://www.znanie-sila.ru/golden/issue2print_9.html |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observable phenomenon of [[hybrid vigor]] stands in contrast to the notion of breed purity. However, on the other hand, indiscriminate breeding of crossbred or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animals may also result in degradation of quality. Studies in [[evolutionary physiology]], [[behavioral genetics]], and other areas of organismal biology have also made use of deliberate selective breeding, though longer [[generation time]]s and greater difficulty in breeding can make these projects challenging in such [[vertebrates]] as [[house mice]].&lt;ref name="Swallow"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swallow | first1 = JG | author-link2 = Theodore Garland Jr. | last2 = Garland | first2 = T.

== Plant breeding ==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Carrots of many colors.jpg|thumb|Researchers at the [[USDA]] have selectively bred carrots with a variety of colors.]]
Plant breeding has been used for thousands of years, and began with the domestication of [[Wild type|wild]] plants into uniform and predictable agricultural [[cultigen]]s. [[Crop yield|High-yielding]] varieties have been particularly important in agriculture.

Selective plant breeding is also used in research to produce [[transgenic]] animals that breed "true" (i.e., are [[homozygous]]) for artificially inserted or [[gene knockout|deleted]] genes.&lt;ref name="J&amp;K 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=H. K.|last2=Kharkwal|first2=M. C.|title=Plant breeding - Mendelian to molecular approaches.|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston, London, Dordecht|isbn=978-1-4020-1981-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective breeding in aquaculture==
Selective breeding in aquaculture holds high potential for the genetic improvement of fish and shellfish. Unlike terrestrial livestock, the potential benefits of selective breeding in aquaculture were not realized until recently. This is because high mortality led to the selection of only a few broodstock, causing inbreeding depression, which then forced the use of wild broodstock. This was evident in selective breeding programs for growth rate, which resulted in slow growth and high mortality.&lt;ref name=gb/&gt;

Control of the reproduction cycle was one of the main reasons as it is a requisite for selective breeding programs. Artificial reproduction was not achieved because of the difficulties in hatching or feeding some farmed species such as eel and yellowtail farming.&lt;ref name=g85&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00462124| title = Improvement of productivity through breeding schemes| journal = GeoJournal| volume = 10| issue = 3| pages = 233–241| year = 1985| last1 = Gjedrem | first1 = T. | s2cid = 154519652}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A suspected reason associated with the late realisation of success in selective breeding programs in aquaculture was the education of the concerned people – researchers, advisory personnel and fish farmers. The education of fish biologists paid less attention to quantitative genetics and breeding plans.&lt;ref name=g83&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0044-8486(83)90386-1| title = Genetic variation in quantitative traits and selective breeding in fish and shellfish| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 33| issue = 1–4| pages = 51–72| year = 1983| last1 = Gjedrem | first1 = T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another was the failure of documentation of the genetic gains in successive generations. This in turn led to failure in quantifying economic benefits that successful selective breeding programs produce. Documentation of the genetic changes was considered important as they help in fine tuning further selection schemes.&lt;ref name=gb/&gt;

===Quality traits in aquaculture===
Aquaculture species are reared for particular traits such as growth rate, survival rate, meat quality, resistance to diseases, age at sexual maturation, fecundity, shell traits like shell size, shell colour, etc.
*'''Growth rate''' – growth rate is normally measured as either body weight or body length. This trait is of great economic importance for all aquaculture species as faster growth rate speeds up the turnover of production.&lt;ref name=g83/&gt; Improved growth rates show that farmed animals utilize their feed more efficiently through a positive correlated response.&lt;ref name=g85/&gt;
*'''Survival rate''' – survival rate may take into account the degrees of resistance to diseases.&lt;ref name=g85/&gt; This may also see the stress response as fish under stress are highly vulnerable to diseases.&lt;ref name=g83/&gt; The stress fish experience could be of biological, chemical or environmental influence.
*'''Meat quality''' – the quality of fish is of great economic importance in the market. Fish quality usually takes into account size, meatiness, and percentage of fat, colour of flesh, taste, shape of the body, ideal oil and omega-3 content.&lt;ref name=g85/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshi|first1=Rajesh|last2=Woolliams|first2=John|last3=Meuwissen|first3=Theo MJ|title=Maternal, dominance and additive genetic effects in Nile tilapia; influence on growth, fillet yield and body size traits|journal=Heredity|volume=120|issue=5|pages=452–462|date=Jan 2018|doi=10.1038/s41437-017-0046-x|pmid=29335620|pmc=5889400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Age at sexual maturation''' – The age of maturity in aquaculture species is another very important attribute for farmers as during early maturation the species divert all their energy to gonad production affecting growth and meat production and are more susceptible to health problems (Gjerde 1986).
*'''Fecundity''' – As the fecundity in fish and shellfish is usually high it is not considered as a major trait for improvement. However, selective breeding practices may consider the size of the egg and correlate it with survival and early growth rate.&lt;ref name=g85/&gt;

===Finfish response to selection===

====Salmonids====

Gjedrem (1979) showed that selection of Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'') led to an increase in body weight by 30% per generation. A comparative study on the performance of select Atlantic salmon with wild fish was conducted by AKVAFORSK Genetics Centre in Norway. The traits, for which the selection was done included growth rate, feed consumption, protein retention, energy retention, and feed conversion efficiency. Selected fish had a twice better growth rate, a 40% higher feed intake, and an increased protein and energy retention. This led to an overall 20% better Fed Conversion Efficiency as compared to the wild stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0044-8486(99)00204-5 | title = Feed intake, growth and feed utilization of offspring from wild and selected Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'')| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 180| issue = 3–4| pages = 237–246| year = 1999| last1 = Thodesen | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Grisdale-Helland | first2 = B. | last3 = Helland | first3 = S. L. J. | last4 = Gjerde | first4 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic salmon have also been selected for resistance to bacterial and viral diseases. Selection was done to check resistance to Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV). The results showed 66.6% mortality for low-resistant species whereas the high-resistant species showed 29.3% mortality compared to wild species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.08.011| title = Response to selection for resistance against infectious pancreatic necrosis in Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'' L.)| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 272| pages = S62–S68| year = 2007| last1 = Storset | first1 = A. | last2 = Strand | first2 = C. | last3 = Wetten | first3 = M. | last4 = Kjøglum | first4 = S. | last5 = Ramstad | first5 = A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainbow trout (''S. gairdneri'') was reported to show large improvements in growth rate after 7–10 generations of selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1577/1548-8659(1955)85[93:dortbs]2.0.co;2| title = Development of Rainbow Trout Brood Stock by Selective Breeding| journal = Transactions of the American Fisheries Society| volume = 85| pages = 93–101| year = 1957| last1 = Donaldson | first1 = L.

L.| last2 = Bridges | first2 = W. R.| last3 = von Limbach | first3 = B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 7% increase in growth was recorded per generation for rainbow trout by Kause et al. (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.02.023| title = Genetic trends in growth, sexual maturity and skeletal deformations, and rate of inbreeding in a breeding programme for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 247| issue = 1–4| pages = 177–187| year = 2005| last1 = Kause | first1 = A. | last2 = Ritola | first2 = O. | last3 = Paananen | first3 = T. | last4 = Wahlroos | first4 = H. | last5 = Mäntysaari | first5 = E. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, high resistance to IPNV in rainbow trout has been achieved by selectively breeding the stock. Resistant strains were found to have an average mortality of 4.3% whereas 96.1% mortality was observed in a highly sensitive strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0044-8486(93)90124-h| title = Resistance of a rainbow trout strain to infectious pancreatic necrosis| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 117| issue = 1–2| pages = 71–76| year = 1993| last1 = Okamoto | first1 = N. | last2 = Tayama | first2 = T. | last3 = Kawanobe | first3 = M. | last4 = Fujiki | first4 = N. | last5 = Yasuda | first5 = Y. | last6 = Sano | first6 = T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coho salmon (''Oncorhynchus kisutch'') increase in weight was found to be more than 60% after four generations of selective breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0044-8486(90)90018-i| title = Genetic changes in the growth of coho salmon (''Oncorhynchus kisutch'') in marine net-pens, produced by ten years of selection| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 85| issue = 1–4| pages = 187–197| year = 1990| last1 = Hershberger | first1 = W.

'''Cyprinids'''

Selective breeding programs for the Common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'') include improvement in growth, shape and resistance to disease. Experiments carried out in the USSR used crossings of broodstocks to increase genetic diversity and then selected the species for traits like growth rate, exterior traits and viability, and/or adaptation to environmental conditions like variations in temperature. Kirpichnikov ''et al.'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1016/b978-0-444-81527-9.50006-3| chapter = Selection of Krasnodar common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'' L.) for resistance to dropsy: Principal results and prospects| title = Genetics in Aquaculture| pages = 7| year = 1993| last1 = Kirpichnikov | first1 = V.

The results showed a 30–40% to 77.4% improvement of cold tolerance but did not provide any data for growth rate. An increase in growth rate was observed in the second generation in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0044-8486(93)90064-6| title = Selection of common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'' L.) in Vietnam| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 111| issue = 1–4| pages = 301–302| year = 1993| last1 = Mai Thien Tran| last2 = Cong Thang Nguyen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moav and Wohlfarth (1976) showed positive results when selecting for slower growth for three generations compared to selecting for faster growth. Schaperclaus (1962) showed resistance to the dropsy disease wherein selected lines suffered low mortality (11.5%) compared to unselected (57%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Channel Catfish====

Growth was seen to increase by 12–20% in selectively bred ''Iictalurus punctatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0044-8486(83)90387-3| title = Response to bidirectional selection for body weight in channel catfish| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 33| issue = 1–4| pages = 73–81| year = 1983| last1 = Bondari | first1 = K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the response of the Channel Catfish to selection for improved growth rate was found to be approximately 80%, that is, an average of 13% per generation.

===Shellfish response to selection===

====Oysters====

Selection for live weight of Pacific oysters showed improvements ranging from 0.4% to 25.6% compared to the wild stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0044-8486(02)00621-x| title = Yields of cultured Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas Thunberg improved after one generation of selection| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 220| issue = 1–4| pages = 227–244| year = 2003| last1 = Langdon | first1 = C. | last2 = Evans | first2 = F. | last3 = Jacobson | first3 = D. | last4 = Blouin | first4 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney-rock oysters (''Saccostrea commercialis'') showed a 4% increase after one generation and a 15% increase after two generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0044-8486(96)01328-2| title = Progress in a Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea commercialis (Iredale and Roughley), breeding program| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 144| issue = 4| pages = 295–302| year = 1996| last1 = Nell | first1 = J.

Bonamia ostrea is a protistan parasite that causes catastrophic losses (nearly 98%) in European flat oyster ''Ostrea edulis'' L. This protistan parasite is endemic to three oyster-regions in Europe. Selective breeding programs show that ''O. edulis'' susceptibility to the infection differs across oyster strains in Europe. A study carried out by Culloty et al. showed that ‘Rossmore' oysters in Cork harbour, Ireland had better resistance compared to other Irish strains. A selective breeding program at Cork harbour uses broodstock from 3– to 4-year-old survivors and is further controlled until a viable percentage reaches market size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0044-8486(01)00569-5| title = An investigation into the relative resistance of Irish flat oysters ''Ostrea edulis'' L. to the parasite ''Bonamia ostreae''| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 199| issue = 3–4| pages = 229–244| year = 2001| last1 = Culloty | first1 = S.

Over the years ‘Rossmore' oysters have shown to develop lower prevalence of ''B. ostreae'' infection and percentage mortality. Ragone Calvo et al. (2003) selectively bred the eastern oyster, ''Crassostrea virginica'', for resistance against co-occurring parasites ''Haplosporidium nelson'' (MSX) and ''Perkinsus marinus'' (Dermo). They achieved dual resistance to the disease in four generations of selective breeding. The oysters showed higher growth and survival rates and low susceptibility to the infections. At the end of the experiment, artificially selected ''C. virginica'' showed a 34–48% higher survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0044-8486(02)00399-x| title = Dual disease resistance in a selectively bred eastern oyster, ''Crassostrea virginica'', strain tested in Chesapeake Bay| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 220| issue = 1–4| pages = 69–87| year = 2003| last1 = Ragone Calvo | first1 = L.

====Penaeid shrimps====
Selection for growth in Penaeid shrimps yielded successful results. A selective breeding program for ''Litopenaeus stylirostris'' saw an 18% increase in growth after the fourth generation and 21% growth after the fifth generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goyard | first1 = E. | last2 = Patrois | first2 = J. | last3 = Reignon | first3 = J.-M. | last4 = Vanaa | first4 = V. | last5 = Dufour | first5 = R | last6 = Be | year = 1999 | title = IFREMER's shrimp genetics program | journal = Global Aquaculture Advocate | volume = 2 | issue = 6| pages = 26–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marsupenaeus japonicas'' showed a 10.7% increase in growth after the first generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0044-8486(99)00237-9| title = Response to selection and heritability for growth in the Kuruma prawn, ''Penaeus japonicus''| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 181| issue = 3–4| pages = 215–223| year = 2000| last1 = Hetzel | first1 = D.

(2002) conducted a selective breeding program on the Pacific White Shrimp,'' Litopenaeus vannamei'' at The Oceanic Institute, Waimanalo, USA from 1995 to 1998. They reported significant responses to selection compared to the unselected control shrimps. After one generation, a 21% increase was observed in growth and 18.4% increase in survival to TSV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0044-8486(01)00830-4| title = Selective breeding of Pacific white shrimp (''Litopenaeus vannamei'') for growth and resistance to Taura Syndrome Virus| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 204| issue = 3–4| pages = 447–460| year = 2002| last1 = Argue | first1 = B.

Oceanos S.A. in Colombia selected the survivors of the disease from infected ponds and used them as parents for the next generation. They achieved satisfying results in two or three generations wherein survival rates approached levels before the outbreak of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.09.011| title = Breeding for disease resistance of Penaeid shrimps| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 286| issue = 1–2| pages = 1–11| year = 2009| last1 = Cock | first1 = J. | last2 = Gitterle | first2 = T. | last3 = Salazar | first3 = M. | last4 = Rye | first4 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting heavy losses (up to 90%) caused by Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) caused a number of shrimp farming industries started to selectively breed shrimps resistant to this disease. Successful outcomes led to development of Super Shrimp, a selected line of ''L. stylirostris'' that is resistant to IHHNV infection. Tang et al. (2000) confirmed this by showing no mortalities in IHHNV- challenged Super Shrimp post larvae and juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0044-8486(00)00407-5 | title = Postlarvae and juveniles of a selected line of ''Penaeus stylirostris'' are resistant to infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus infection| journal = Aquaculture| volume = 190| issue = 3–4| pages = 203–210| year = 2000| last1 = Tang | first1 = K.

===Aquatic species versus terrestrial livestock===
Selective breeding programs for aquatic species provide better outcomes compared to terrestrial livestock. This higher response to selection of aquatic farmed species can be attributed to the following:
* High fecundity in both sexes fish and shellfish enabling higher selection intensity.
* Large phenotypic and genetic variation in the selected traits.

Selective breeding in aquaculture provide remarkable economic benefits to the industry, the primary one being that it reduces production costs due to faster turnover rates. This is because of faster growth rates, decreased maintenance rates, increased energy and protein retention, and better feed efficiency.&lt;ref name=gb&gt;Gjedrem, T &amp; Baranski, M. (2009). ''Selective breeding in Aquaculture: An Introduction''. 1st Edition. Springer. {{ISBN|978-90-481-2772-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying such genetic improvement program to aquaculture species will increase productivity to meet the increasing demands of growing populations.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Selective breeding is a direct way to determine if a specific trait can evolve in response to selection. A single-generation method of breeding is not as accurate or direct. The process is also more practical and easier to understand than sibling analysis. Selective breeding is better for traits such as [[physiology]] and behavior that are hard to measure because it requires fewer individuals to test than single-generation testing.

However, there are disadvantages to this process. Because a single experiment done in selective breeding cannot be used to assess an entire group of genetic variances, individual experiments must be done for every individual trait. Also, because of the necessity of selective breeding experiments to require maintaining the organisms tested in a lab or [[greenhouse]], it is impractical to use this breeding method on many organisms. Controlled mating instances are difficult to carry out in this case and this is a necessary component of selective breeding.&lt;ref name="Artificial Selection"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1650:asaptf]2.0.co;2| title=Artificial Selection: A Powerful Tool for Ecologists| journal=Ecology| volume=84| issue=7| pages=1650–1660| year=2003| last1=Conner | first1=J.

[[File:Selenocysteine skeletal 3D.svg|thumb|[[Selenocysteine]] the main organic molecule involving [[Selenium]] in [[humans]]]]
Although it is toxic in large doses, [[selenium]] is an essential [[micronutrient]] for animals. In plants, it sometimes occurs in toxic amounts as [[forage]], e.g. [[locoweed]]. Selenium is a component of the [[amino acid]]s [[selenocysteine]] and [[selenomethionine]]. In humans, selenium is a [[dietary mineral|trace element]] nutrient that functions as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for [[glutathione peroxidase]]s and certain forms of [[thioredoxin reductase]].&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Lippard, J. M. Berg "Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry" University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA; 1994.  {{ISBN|0-935702-73-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium-containing proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of [[Selenophosphate synthetase 1|selenophosphate]] (PSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Se-containing biomolecules==

Selenium is an essential [[micronutrient]] in mammals, but is also recognized as toxic in excess. Selenium exerts its biological functions through [[selenoprotein]]s, which contain the [[amino acid]] [[selenocysteine]]. Twenty-five selenoproteins are encoded in the [[human genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Glutathione peroxidase===
The [[glutathione peroxidase]] family of enzymes (abbreviated GSH-Px) catalyze reduction of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and organic [[hydroperoxide]]s:

:2GSH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   GSSG  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The two H atoms are donated by thiols in a process that begins with oxidation of a [[selenol]] side chain in GSH-Px.  The [[organoselenium compound]] [[ebselen]] is a drug used to supplement the action of GSH-Px.  It functions as a catalyst for the destruction of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bhabak Krishna P., Mugesh Govindasamy | year = 2010 | title = Functional Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase: Bioinspired Synthetic Antioxidants | journal = Acc. Chem. Res. | volume = 43 | issue = 11| pages = 1408–1419 | doi = 10.1021/ar100059g | pmid = 20690615 | last2 = Mugesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related selenium-containing enzyme in some plants and in animals ([[thioredoxin reductase]]) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]] that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.&lt;ref name="Stadtman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stadtman TC |title=Selenocysteine |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=65 |pages=83–100 |year=1996 |pmid=8811175 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.65.070196.000503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deiodinases===
Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the [[thyroid]] gland.  It participates as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for the three [[thyroid hormone]] [[deiodinase]]s.  These enzymes activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ |publisher = Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University |title = Selenium |access-date = 2009-01-05|date = 2014-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may inhibit [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis|Hashimoto's disease]], an auto-immune disease in which the body's own thyroid cells are attacked by the immune system. A reduction of 21% on TPO antibodies was reported with the dietary intake of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg of selenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17696828 |title = Effects of 12 months treatment with L-selenomethionine on serum anti-TPO Levels in Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis |year=2007 |last1=Mazokopakis |first1=EE |last2=Papadakis |first2=JA |last3=Papadomanolaki |first3=MG |last4=Batistakis |first4=AG |last5=Giannakopoulos |first5=TG |last6=Protopapadakis |first6=EE |last7=Ganotakis |first7=ES |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=609–12 |doi=10.1089/thy.2007.0040 |journal=Thyroid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formate dehydrogenase===
Some microorganisms utilize selenium in [[formate dehydrogenase]]. Formate is produced in large amounts in the hepatic (liver cells) mitochondria of embryonic cells and in cancer cells by the folate cycle.&lt;ref&gt;H Frederik Nijhout, et al, In silico experimentation with a model of hepatic mitochondrial folate metabolism, Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, 2006, 3:40, link http://www.tbiomed.com/content/3/1/40/abstract).&lt;/ref&gt;

Formate is reversibly oxidized by the enzyme [[formate dehydrogenase]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reda T., Plugge C. M., Abram N. J., Hirst J. | year = 2008 | title = Reversible interconversion of carbon dioxide and formate by an electroactive enzyme | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = 31| pages = 10654–10658 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0801290105 | pmid = 18667702 | last2 = Plugge | last3 = Abram | last4 = Hirst | pmc = 2491486 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10510654R | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  →   CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Thioredoxin reductase ===
[[Thioredoxin reductase]] uses a cysteine-selenocysteine pair to reduce the [[disulfide]] in [[thioredoxin]]. The selenocysteine  is arranged in an unusual Sec-His-Glu [[catalytic triad]], which tunes its pKa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|pmid=15651042|s2cid=25575160|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicator plants==
Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are ''[[Astragalus]]'' species (including some [[locoweed]]s), prince's plume (''[[Stanleya (plant)|Stanleya]]'' sp.), woody asters (''[[Xylorhiza (plant)|Xylorhiza]]'' sp.), and false goldenweed (''[[Oonopsis]]'' sp.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/54282000/PPClassPPSlides/3-27-08DavisSelenium.pdf |title = Selenium in Plants |access-date = 2008-12-05 |author= Zane Davis, T. |year = 2008 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use of synthetic selenium compounds==
The substance loosely called [[selenium disulfide|selenium sulfide]] (with the approximate formula SeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the active ingredient in some anti-dandruff shampoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pharmacycode.com/Selenium(IV)_sulfide.html |title =Selenium(IV)_sulfide |publisher = Pharmacy Codes |access-date = 2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selenium compound kills the scalp fungus ''[[Malassezia]]'', which causes shedding of dry skin fragments. The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat [[Tinea versicolor]] due to infection by a different species of ''Malassezia'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/selenium.html |title = Selenium sulfide |publisher = DermNet NZ |access-date = 2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several clinical trials have assessed the use of selenium supplements in critically ill adults; however, the effectiveness and potential benefits of selenium supplementation in this context is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Allingstrup|first1=Mikkel|last2=Afshari|first2=Arash|date=2015-07-27|title=Selenium supplementation for critically ill adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD003703|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003703.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6517228|pmid=26214143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection in biological fluids==
Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1416–1420.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
Although selenium is an essential [[dietary mineral|trace element]], it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Tolerable Upper Intake Level]] of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h7 |title = Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium |publisher = National Institutes of Health; Office of Dietary Supplements |access-date = 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 400 microgram ([[Microgram|µg]]) Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids |publisher = Institute of Medicine |date = August 15, 2000 |pages = 314–315 |url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&amp;page=315 |isbn = 978-0-309-06949-6 |author = a report of the Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, Subcommittees on Upper Reference Leves of Nutrients and of Interpretation and Use of Dietary Reference Intakes, and the Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid [[toxicity]], but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;

Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can result in [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pulmonary edema]], and death.&lt;ref name="tp92-c3"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c3.pdf |publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title = Public Health Statement: Health Effects |access-date = 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elemental selenium and most metallic [[selenide]]s have relatively low toxicities because of their low [[bioavailability]]. By contrast, [[selenate]]s and [[Selenite (ion)|selenites]] are very toxic, having an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Wilber |first = C. G. |title = Toxicology of selenium |year = 1980 |journal = Clinical Toxicology |volume = 17 |pages = 171–230 |doi = 10.3109/15563658008985076 |pmid = 6998645|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrogen selenide]] is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.3109/10915818609140736 |title = Selenium Toxicity in Animals with Emphasis on Man |year = 1986 |author = Olson, O.E. |journal = International Journal of Toxicology |volume = 5 |page = 45|s2cid = 74619246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, [[selenomethionine]], [[selenocysteine]] and [[methylselenocysteine]], all of which have high [[bioavailability]] and are toxic in large doses.

[[Selenium Pollution|Selenium poisoning]] of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new "wetlands" as the water evaporates. High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qN0I3husm50C&amp;pg=PA477 |chapter = Ecotoxicology of selenium |title = Handbook of ecotoxicology |first = H.

[[File:Se dose-response curve for juvenile salmon mortality - percent scale.jpg|thumb|Relationship between survival of juvenile salmon and concentration of selenium in their tissues after 90 days (Chinook salmon: Hamilton et al. 1990) or 45 days (Atlantic salmon: Poston et al. 1976) exposure to dietary selenium. The 10% lethality level (LC10=1.84 µg/g) was derived by applying the biphasic model of Brain and Cousens (1989) to only the Chinook salmon data. The Chinook salmon data comprise two series of dietary treatments, combined here because the effects on survival are indistinguishable.]]

In fish and other wildlife, low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity.  For example, in salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue (whole body) is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue (dry weight).  At levels much below that concentration, young salmon die from selenium deficiency;&lt;ref name= Poston. &gt;{{cite journal | last= Poston | first= H. A. |author2= Combs, G.

==Deficiency==
{{main|Selenium deficiency}}
Selenium deficiency can occur in patients with severely compromised [[intestine|intestinal]] function, those undergoing [[total parenteral nutrition]], and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Effect of micronutrient status on natural killer cell immune function in healthy free-living subjects aged &gt;=90 y1 |author = Ravaglia |volume = 71 |issue = 2 |pages = 590–598 |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |pmid = 10648276 |date=1 February 2000 |last2 = Forti |first2 = P |last3 = Maioli |first3 = F |last4 = Bastagli |first4 = L |last5 = Facchini |first5 = A |last6 = Mariani |first6 = E |last7 = Savarino |first7 = L |last8 = Sassi |first8 = S |last9 = Cucinotta |first9 = D|last10 = Lenaz |first10 = G |display-authors = 3 |doi = 10.1093/ajcn/71.2.590 |doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although [[New Zealand]] has low levels of selenium in its soil, adverse health effects have not been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/Sel.htm |work = Prescriber Update Articles |title = Selenium |access-date = 2009-07-13 |publisher = New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |author = MedSafe Editorial Team }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium deficiency as defined by low (&lt;60% of normal) selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues only occurs when a low selenium status is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ralston|first=N.V.C.|author2=Raymond, L.J. |title=Dietary selenium's protective effects against methylmercury toxicity|journal=Toxicology|year=2010|volume=278|issue=1|pages=112–123|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2010.06.004|pmid=20561558}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a result of increased oxidant stress due to vitamin E deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Essentials of Human Nutrition |edition = 2nd |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-19-262756-8 |first1 = Jim |last1 = Mann |first2 = A. Stewart |last2 = Truswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium interacts with other nutrients, such as [[iodide]] and [[vitamin E]]. The interaction is observed in the [[etiology]] of many deficiency diseases in animals, and pure selenium deficiency is rare. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to [[Kashin-Beck disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Selenium and iodine supplementation of rural Tibetan children affected by Kashin-Beck osteoarthropathy |first1 = Rodrigo |last1 =Moreno-Reyes |first2 = Jean |last2 =Mathieu| first3 = Marleen |last3 =Vanderpas| first4 = Françoise |last4 = Begaux| first5 = Carl |last5 =Suetens| first6 = Maria T. |last6 =Rivera| first7 = Jean |last7 =Nève| first8 = Noémi |last8 =Perlmutter |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume = 78 |issue = 1 |pages = 137–144 |year = 2003 |author9=V |pmid=12816783 |doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.1.137 |doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==
The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for selenium in 2000. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for selenium for people ages 14 and up is 45 μg/day. The RDA is 55 μg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 60 μg/day. RDA for lactation is 70 μg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 20 to 40 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of selenium the UL is 400 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name="DRItext"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Medicine | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids | chapter = Selenium | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2000 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 284–324 | doi = 10.17226/9810 | pmid = 25077263 | isbn = 978-0-309-06935-9 | chapter-url = https://www.nap.edu/read/9810/chapter/9| author1-link = Institute of Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 70 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 70 μg/day, for lactation 85 μg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 15 to 55 μg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 300 μg/day, which is lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, selenium deficiency is not common. A federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 89 and 125 μg/day, respectively. For women and men of all ages fewer than 3% consumed less than the EAR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/0102/usualintaketables2001-02.pdf/ What We Eat In America, NHANES 2001–2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106010550/https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/0102/usualintaketables2001-02.pdf |date=2015-01-06 }}.

For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For selenium labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 70 μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 55 μg.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Daily Value Reference of the Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) | website=Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) | url=https://www.dsld.nlm.nih.gov/dsld/dailyvalue.jsp | access-date=16 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]].

==Food sources==
Dietary selenium comes from nuts, [[cereals]], [[meat]], [[mushrooms]], [[fish]], and [[egg (food)|egg]]s. [[Brazil nut]]s are the richest ordinary dietary source and could cause selenium toxicity if consumed regularly – though the actual concentration of selenium (as with any plant-based food sources, such as another selenium-accumulating "paradise nut" [[Lecythis]], belonging to the same family [[Lecythidaceae]]) is soil-dependent and may vary significantly by geographic location. In descending order of concentration, high levels are also found in [[kidney]], [[tuna]], [[crab]], and [[lobster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Barclay |first = Margaret N.

The human body's content of selenium is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.&lt;ref&gt;The most popular web reference for this is [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6424964].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selenium in cancer===
[[File:Selenium paradox.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Selenium at nutritional levels is required for cell [[homeostasis]], playing a role as an [[Antioxidant|anti-oxidant]] through [[selenoprotein]]s, thus, act [[Chemopreventive agent|chemo-preventive]] against cancer. In contrast, supra-nutritional levels act as [[pro-oxidant]] toxic in [[tumour]] cells.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Razaghi|first1=Ali|last2=Poorebrahim|first2=Mansour|last3=Sarhan|first3=Dhifaf|last4=Björnstedt|first4=Mikael|date=September 2021|title=Selenium stimulates the antitumour immunity: Insights to future research|journal=European Journal of Cancer|volume=155|pages=256–267|doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2021.07.013|pmid=34392068|issn=0959-8049|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Selenium]] has bimodal biological action depending on the concentration. At low nutritional doses, selenium acts as an [[Antioxidants &amp; Redox Signaling|antioxidant]] through [[selenoprotein]]s, scavenging [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]], supporting cell survival and growth; while, at supra-nutritional higher pharmacological doses, selenium acts as a [[pro-oxidant]] generating [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] and inducing [[cell death]]. In cancer, studies have been conducted mostly on the benefits of selenium intake in reducing the risk of cancer incidence at the nutritional level; however, fewer studies have explored the effects of supra-nutritional or pharmacological doses of selenium on cancer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"Although an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies, this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and these results should be interpreted with caution... Conflicting results including inverse, null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types... RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results... To date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vinceti|first1=Marco|last2=Filippini|first2=Tommaso|last3=Del Giovane|first3=Cinzia|last4=Dennert|first4=Gabriele|last5=Zwahlen|first5=Marcel|last6=Brinkman|first6=Maree|last7=Zeegers|first7=Maurice Pa|last8=Horneber|first8=Markus|last9=D'Amico|first9=Roberto|date=January 29, 2018|title=Selenium for preventing cancer|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD005195|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005195.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=29376219|pmc=6491296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Selenium in anti-tumour immunity ====
To date, many studies have been conducted on the benefits of selenium intake in reducing the risk of [[cancer incidence]] at the nutritional level, indicating that likely selenium functions as an [[immunostimulator]], i.e. reversing the [[immunosuppression]] in [[Tumor microenvironment|tumour microenvironment]] towards antitumour [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] by activating [[White blood cell|immune cells]] (e.g. [[Macrophage|M1 macrophages]] and [[CD8+ T lymphocyte|CD8+ T-lymphocytes]], the elevated number of [[neutrophil]]s and activated cytotoxic [[Natural killer cell|NK cells]]) and releasing [[pro-inflammatory]] [[cytokine]]s such as [[IFNγ]] and [[Tumor necrosis factor|TNFα]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
[[File:Selenium and anti-tumour immunity.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Selenium can either play a [[pro-oxidant]] role inducing [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]], activating the [[NF-κB pathway|Akt–NF–кB pathway]] or play an [[antioxidant]] role through [[selenoprotein]] synthesis such as [[TXNRD1|TXNRD]] relocating to the nucleus and activating [[NF-κB|NF-кB]], resulting in further activation of [[leukocytes]] and pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] genes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
AIDS appears to involve a slow and progressive decline in levels of selenium in the body. Whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of HIV or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by AIDS patients remains debated. Observational studies have found an association between decreased selenium levels and poorer outcomes in patients with HIV, though these studies were mostly done prior to the currently effective treatments with highly active antiretroviral therapy ([[HAART]]).  Currently there is inadequate evidence to recommend routine selenium supplementation for HIV patients, and further research is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stone CA, Kawai K, Kupka R, Fawzi WW |title=Role of selenium in HIV infection |journal=Nutr. Rev. |volume=68 |issue=11 |pages=671–81 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20961297 |pmc=3066516 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00337.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortality===
Selenium supplementation has no effect on overall mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid =22419320|year =2012|last1 =Bjelakovic|first1 =G|last2 =Nikolova|first2 =D|last3 =Gluud|first3 =LL|last4 =Simonetti|first4 =RG|last5 =Gluud|first5 =C|title =Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases|volume =2012|issue =3|pages =CD007176|doi =10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2|journal =Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|pmc =8407395|editor1-last =Bjelakovic|editor1-first =Goran|type =Submitted manuscript|hdl =10138/136201|hdl-access =free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuberculosis===
As with other types of supplementation, there is no good evidence selenium supplementation helps in the treatment of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grobler L, Nagpal S, Sudarsanam TD, Sinclair D |title=Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=6 |pages=CD006086 |year=2016 |volume=2016 |pmid=27355911 |pmc=4981643 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006086.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes===

A meta-analysis of four RCTs concluded that there is no support for selenium supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Caucasians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mao S, Zhang A, Huang S |title=Selenium supplementation and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Endocrine |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=758–63 |year=2014 |pmid=24858736 |doi=10.1007/s12020-014-0298-7 |s2cid=22669723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human reproductive system===
Abnormally high or low levels of dietary selenium can have an adverse effect on sperm quality, with a consequent lowering of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ahsan U, Kamran Z, Raza I, etal |title=Role of selenium in male reproduction - a review |journal=[[Anim.

===COVID-19===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, some studies tried to correlate between selenium plasma level and severity of COVID-19 cases. 
One study done on 33 patients concluded that low plasma selenium levels were correlated with a high mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. However, the median age of deaths in this study was 89 years old; in contrast, survivors' median age was 69 years old, and the study stated that the causality remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Moghaddam A, Heller RA, Sun Q, et al. Selenium Deficiency Is Associated with Mortality Risk from COVID-19. Nutrients. 2020;12(7):2098. Published 2020 Jul 16. doi:[https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/7/2098 10.3390/nu12072098]&lt;/ref&gt;  
On the other hand, another study revealed that the mean selenium plasma level was within the normal range among all included COVID-19 patients; however, the mean selenium plasma level was elevated among severe cases of COVID-19. This study concluded that there was a significant elevation of selenium serum level among severe cases compared to non-severe cases of COVID-19, and could be correlated with the disease severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/20905068.2020.1870788|title=Correlation between Micronutrient plasma concentration and disease severity in COVID-19 patients|year=2021|last1=Alkattan|first1=Abdullah|last2=Alabdulkareem|first2=Khaled|last3=Kamel|first3=Amr|last4=Abdelseed|first4=Heba|last5=Almutairi|first5=Yousef|last6=Alsalameen|first6=Eman|journal=Alexandria Journal of Medicine|volume=57|pages=21–27|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution in biology and biosynthetic considerations==

Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine,&lt;ref name="glady"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladyshev VN, Hatfield DL |title=Selenocysteine-containing proteins in mammals |journal=Journal of Biomedical Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=151–60 |year=1999 |pmid=10343164 |doi=10.1007/BF02255899|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biochemgladyshev/77 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules [[glutathione]] and [[thioredoxin]].

Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, [[vanadium]], [[magnesium]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]], may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas.&lt;ref name="glady" /&gt; Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Zhang Y, Sengupta A, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN |title=Evolutionary dynamics of eukaryotic selenoproteomes: large selenoproteomes may associate with aquatic life and small with terrestrial life |journal=Genome Biology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=R198 |year=2007 |pmid=17880704 |pmc=2375036 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The selenium content of SEPP1 versus selenium requirements in vertebrates|journal = PeerJ|pmc = 4699779|pmid = 26734501|volume = 3|pages = e1244|doi = 10.7717/peerj.1244|first1 = Sam|last1 = Penglase|first2 = Kristin|last2 = Hamre|first3 = Ståle|last3 = Ellingsen|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of "new" endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C), [[polyphenol]]s (including flavonoids), [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late [[Jurassic]] period.

About 200 Mya, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Castellano S, Novoselov SV, Kryukov GV, etal |title=Reconsidering the evolution of eukaryotic selenoproteins: a novel nonmammalian family with scattered phylogenetic distribution |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14710190 |pmc=1298953 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kryukov GV, Gladyshev VN |title=The prokaryotic selenoproteome |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=538–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15105824 |pmc=1299047 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilting R, Schorling S, Persson BC, Böck A |title=Selenoprotein synthesis in archaea: identification of an mRNA element of Methanococcus jannaschii probably directing selenocysteine insertion |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=266 |issue=4 |pages=637–41 |year=1997 |pmid=9102456 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1996.0812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Fomenko DE, Gladyshev VN |title=The microbial selenoproteome of the Sargasso Sea |journal=Genome Biology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=R37 |year=2005 |pmid=15833124 |pmc=1088965 |doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-4-r37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], a '''self-limiting''' organism or colony of organisms limits its own growth by its actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Self-limitation as an explanation for species' relative abundances and the long-term persistence of rare species |last1=Yenni |first1=Glenda Marie |type=PhD dissertation |publisher=Utah State University |date=2013|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2944&amp;context=etd |doi=10.26076/7381-023c}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a single organism may have a maximum size determined by [[genetics]], or a colony of organisms may release waste which is ultimately toxic to the colony once it exceeds a certain [[population]]. In some cases, the self-limiting nature of a colony may be advantageous to the continued survival of the colony, such as in the case of [[parasite]]s.  If their numbers became too high, they would kill the [[host (biology)|host]], and thus themselves. In other cases, self-limitation restricts the viability of predators, thus ensuring the long-term survival of rare species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A computational functional genomics based self-limiting self-concentration mechanism of cell specialization as a biological role of jumping genes|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ib/c5ib00203f|journal=Integrative Biology|first1=Jörn |last1=Lötsch|first2=Alfred |last2=Ultschc|date=2016|issue=1|volume=8|doi=10.1039/C5IB00203F|pmid=26679724|pages=91–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], the term may imply that a condition would run its course without the need of external influence, especially any medical treatment.

==The mechanism==

SEPTIC utilizes [[bacteriophage]]s as indicators to trigger an ionic response by the bacteria during phage infection.&lt;ref name=jbpc&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ece.tamu.edu/%7Enoise/research_files/King_et_al_JBPC.pdf | title = M. Dobozi-King, S. Seo, J.U. Kim, R. Young, M. Cheng, L.B. Kish, "Rapid detection and identification of bacteria: SEnsing of Phage-Triggered Ion Cascade (SEPTIC)", ''Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry'' '''5''' (2005) 3–7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fnl_1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ece.tamu.edu/%7Enoise/research_files/Kish_septic.pdf | title = L.B.

The electrode pair in the electrolyte with different local ion concentrations at the vicinity of electrodes form an [[electrochemical cell]] that produces a voltage depending on the instantaneous ratio of local concentrations.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite arXiv | eprint = 1004.0147 | title = G. Schmera, L.B. Kish, "Bacteria Identification by Phage Induced Impedance Fluctuation Analysis (BIPIF)", ''US Navy patent pending''; to be published | author1 = Gabor Schmera | author2 = Kish | class = physics.ins-det | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concentrations are fluctuating, an alternating random voltage difference will appear between the electrodes. According to the experimental studies, whenever there is an ongoing phage infection, the power density spectrum of the measured [[Noise (electronics)|''electronic noise'']] will have a {{nowrap| 1/''f'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[Spectral density|noise spectrum]] while, without phage infection, it is a [[1/f noise]] spectrum. In order to have a high sensitivity, a DC electrical field attracts the infected bacteria (which are charged due to ion imbalance) to the electrode with the relevant polarization.&lt;ref name=fnl_2/&gt;

==Advantages==

The advantages of SEPTIC are the specificity and speed (needs only a few minutes) offered by the characteristics of phage infection, the sensitivity due to [[fluctuation-enhanced sensing]], and durability originating from the robustness of phages. An idealistic SEPTIC device may be as small as a pen and maybe able to identify a library of different bacteria within a few minutes measurement window.

==History==

The SEPTIC concept was first conceived by [[Laszlo B. Kish]] and Maria Dobozi-King&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; in 2004, and developed and demonstrated at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in collaboration with Mosong Cheng, Ry Young, [[Sergey M. Bezrukov]] (NIH), and Bob Biard.&lt;ref name=nanotech&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nanotechwire.com/news.asp?nid=1678 | title = Featuring SEPTIC in Nanotechwire  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new, related scheme, BIPIF,&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt; that has recently been conceived and analyzed by [[Laszlo B. Kish]] and Gabor Schmera (SPAWAR, [[United States Navy]]) utilizes the AC impedance fluctuations at related arrangements, and it promises higher sensitivity and less dependence on the electrodes.

'''Sentinel cells''' refer to cells in the body's ''first line of defense'', which embed themselves in [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] such as [[skin]].&lt;ref name="Cope with cytokines - sentinel cells"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=sentinel%20cells | title=sentinel cells | accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sentinel cells can refer to specific [[antigen-presenting cell]]s, such as:
*'''[[Macrophage]]s'''
**[[Kupffer cell]]s - ''in the [[liver]]''
**[[Langerhans cell]]s - ''in the [[skin]] and [[mucosa]] (*these are a form of dendritic cells)''
**[[Alveolar macrophage]]s - ''in the [[human lung|lungs]]
**[[Microglia]] - ''in the [[brain]]''
*'''[[Dendritic cell]]s'''
'''Sentinel cells''' can also refer to cells that are normally not specialized antigen-presenting cells such as:&lt;ref name="Cope with cytokines - sentinel cells"/&gt;
*[[Mast cell]]s
*''Specialized'' [[T cell]]s
Sometimes [[somatic cell|tissue cells]] not part of the [[immune system]] such as are also referred to as '''Sentinel cells''':&lt;ref name="Cope with cytokines - sentinel cells"/&gt;
*[[Fibroblast]]s

The '''Séralini affair''' was the controversy surrounding the publication, retraction, and republication of a [[journal article]] by French [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]] [[Gilles-Éric Séralini]]. First published by ''[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]] '' in September 2012, the article presented a two-year feeding study in rats, and reported an increase in [[tumor]]s among rats fed [[genetically modified maize|genetically modified corn]] and the [[herbicide]] [[RoundUp]]. Scientists and regulatory agencies subsequently concluded that the study's design was flawed and its findings unsubstantiated. A chief criticism was that each part of the study had too few rats to obtain statistically useful data, particularly because the strain of rat used, [[Sprague Dawley rat|Sprague Dawley]], develops tumors at a high rate over its lifetime.&lt;ref name=Hayes2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=CassasusNatureNews25June2014/&gt;

The publicity surrounding publication of the article also attracted criticism, with science writer Declan Butler calling it "a tightly orchestrated media offensive".&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/490158a |title=Hyped GM maize study faces growing scrutiny |date=10 October 2012 |last1=Butler |first1=Declan |journal=Nature |volume=490 |issue=7419 |pages=158 |pmid=23060167|bibcode=2012Natur.490..158B |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a [[news embargo]], Séralini required journalists to sign an unusual [[confidentiality agreement]] in exchange for advance access to the article, prohibiting them from conferring with other scientists before the [[Science by press conference|press conference]] announcing publication.{{refn|group=n|[[Agence France-Presse]], 20 September 2012: "Breaking with a long tradition in scientific journalism, the authors allowed a selected group of reporters to have access to the paper, provided they signed confidentiality agreements that prevented them from consulting other experts about the research before publication."&lt;ref name=AFP20Sept2012/&gt;}} At the press conference, Séralini emphasized the study's potential cancer implications, and photographs from the article of treated rats with large tumors were widely circulated by the media.&lt;ref name=AFP20Sept2012&gt;{{cite web|title=France orders probe after rat study links genetically modified corn to cancer|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/750751/france-orders-probe-after-rat-study-links-genetically-modified-corn-to-cancer|publisher=Agence France-Presse|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Society of Toxicologic Pathology pointed out that, because such tumors are commonly found in older rats, the inclusion in the article of those images from treated rats, without also showing control rats, was misleading.&lt;ref name=Barale-ThomasMarch2013/&gt; Séralini also released a book and documentary film about the study in conjunction with the press conference.&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Butler, Declan|title=Rat study sparks GM furore|journal=Nature News|volume=489|issue=7417|pages=484|date=25 September 2012|doi=10.1038/489484a|pmid=23018942|bibcode=2012Natur.489..484B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following widespread criticism by scientists, ''Food and Chemical Toxicology'' retracted the paper in November 2013 after the authors refused to withdraw it.&lt;ref name=Elsevier2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier Announces Article Retraction from Journal Food and Chemical Toxicology|url=http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology|publisher=Elsevier|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor-in-chief said that the article was retracted because its data were inconclusive and its conclusions unreliable.&lt;ref name=Hayes2014/&gt; In June 2014 an amended version of the article was republished in ''[[Environmental Sciences Europe]]'',&lt;ref name="SeraliniRepublish2014" /&gt; and the raw data were made public. According to writer Nathanael Johnson, not all of the raw data were, in fact, released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Nathanael|title=Retracted Roundup-fed rat research republished|url=https://grist.org/food/retracted-roundup-fed-rat-research-republished/|access-date=4 April 2018|publisher=Grist|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal did not conduct any further [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]]; reviewers checked only that the scientific content of the paper had not changed.&lt;ref name=CassasusNatureNews25June2014&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15463|last1=Cassasus|first1=Barbara|title=Paper claiming GM link with tumours republished|journal=Nature|date=25 June 2014|s2cid=155666600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Gilles-Éric Séralini}}


Séralini, a professor of molecular biology at the [[University of Caen]], is president of the scientific advisory board of the Committee of Research and Independent Information on Genetic Engineering (CRIIGEN), which opposes [[genetically modified food]] (GM food).

== 2012 study ==

=== Study background ===
On 19 September 2012, the journal ''[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]]'' published a peer-reviewed paper entitled "Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize."&lt;ref name=Seralini2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Séralini | first1 = Gilles-Eric | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 50 | issue = 11| pages = 4221–4231 | doi=10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.005 | pmid=22999595| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012" /&gt; The two-year toxicity study, which cost €3.2 million, was conducted at the University of Caen by Séralini and seven colleagues. It had been funded by and run with the collaboration of CRIIGEN.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianSeralini/&gt;

The study used 100 male and 100 female [[Sprague Dawley]] rats, divided into twenty groups with 10 rats each. Ten diets were tested separately on the males and females. The diets comprised 11 percent, 22 percent and 33 percent genetically modified corn (NK603) and the rest standard laboratory rat food; NK603 corn that had been treated with Roundup, also at 11, 22 and 33 percent; and corn that had not been genetically modified, accompanied by differing concentrations of Roundup in the water. A control group was fed 33 percent non-GMO corn; the rest of their diet was standard laboratory rat food.&lt;ref name=VIB&gt;[http://www.vib.be/en/news/Documents/20121008_EN_Analyse%20rattenstudie%20S%C3%A9ralini%20et%20al.pdf "A scientific analysis of the rat study conducted by Gilles Eric Séralini et al."], Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie, 19 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

The paper's abstract stated: "In females, all treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable."

=== Publication strategy ===
Séralini held a [[Science by press conference|press conference]] on the day the study was released in which he "promoted the cancer results as the study's major finding."&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012"/&gt; At the press conference he also announced the release of a book and film about the study.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tous Cobayes !: OGM, pesticides et produits chimiques  |first=Gilles-Eric |last=Séralini  |publisher=Editions Flammarion |year=2012 |isbn=978-2-08-126236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2411114/ |title=Tous cobayes? (2012) – IMDb |work=[[IMDb]] |publisher=IMDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected journalists were given early access to the paper on condition they sign a confidentiality agreement, which meant they were unable to confer with other scientists before the [[Embargo (academic publishing)|embargo]] expired.&lt;ref name=AFP20Sept2012/&gt; In contrast, embargo guidelines by journals such as [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] allow reporters to check their stories with independent experts.{{refn|group=n|''[[Nature Geoscience]]'' editorial, December 2011: "Giving the media advance notice of upcoming papers and full access to them several days before publication allows reporters time to research a story, and ask independent experts to comment on the full peer-reviewed paper."&lt;ref name="naturepre"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Embargoes on the web|date=22 December 2011|volume=5|doi=10.1038/ngeo1365|page=1|journal=Nature Geoscience|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seralini's approach was widely criticized. A [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] editorial called it "a public-relations offensive." The result of the confidentiality agreement, the journal said, was that critical commentary was absent from the first round of stories, the ones most likely to be remembered.{{refn|group=n|[[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], September 2012: "With such strong claims and the predictably large effect they will have on public opinion, researchers should take care how they present their findings to the public and the media. They should spell out their results clearly; emphasize the limitations and caveats; and make it clear that the data still need to be assessed, and replicated, by the scientific community. That didn't happen. The paper was promoted in a public-relations offensive, with a related book and film set for release this week. Furthermore, journalists wishing to report the research had to sign confidentiality agreements that prevented them from contacting other scientists for comment on the paper until after the embargo had expired. Some, to their credit, refused, or accepted and then revisited the story critically once their hands were no longer tied by these outrageous restrictions. The result was the exclusion of critical comment in many of the breaking stories — the ones that most people will remember."&lt;ref name="NatureOnSeralini2012"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Poison postures | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7417 | page = 474 |date=September 2012 | pmid = 23025010 | doi = 10.1038/489474a | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The press conference and publication occurred weeks before the vote on [[California Proposition 37 (2012)|California Proposition 37]], which called for labeling [[genetically modified food]]. The study was cited by supporters of the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/09/20129257471016420.html|title=California's Prop 37: Monsanto, GMO labelling and the public interest|publisher=Al Jazeera|first=Charlotte|last=Silver|date=26 September 2012|access-date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics committee of the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] wrote that Seralini's public-relations approach was "inappropriate for a high-quality and objective scientific debate."&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012" /&gt; Science journalist [[Carl Zimmer]] criticized the science journalists who participated.&lt;ref&gt;On the Media Radio Show, 2012 Sep 28 [http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/sep/28/manipulating-science-reporting/ Manipulating Science Reporting]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cosmos Magazine]]''{{'s}} [[Elizabeth Finkel]] said that the confidentiality clause had allowed Seralini's story to "prance unfettered" before second opinions arrived.&lt;ref name=cosmos&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130610121733/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/gm-corn-and-cancer-seralini-affair/ GM Corn and Cancer: the Seralini Affair]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Scientific evaluation ===
The study was criticized by various regulatory authorities and scientists. With few exceptions, the scientific community dismissed the study and called for a more rigorous peer-review system in scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinelli|first1=L|last2=Karbarz|first2=M|last3=Siipi|first3=H|title=Science, safety, and trust: the case of transgenic food.|journal=Croatian Medical Journal|date=February 2013|volume=54|issue=1|pages=91–6|doi=10.3325/cmj.2013.54.91|pmid=23444254|pmc=3584506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many said that Séralini's conclusions were impossible to justify given the [[statistical power]] of the study. Sprague-Dawley rats have a lifespan of about two years and have a high risk of cancer over their lifespan (one study concluded that over eighty percent of males and over seventy percent of females developed cancer under normal conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=521452 |year=1979 |last1=Suzuki |first1=H |last2=Mohr |first2=U |last3=Kimmerle |first3=G |title=Spontaneous endocrine tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=187–96 |journal=Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology |doi=10.1007/BF00401012|s2cid=33262883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huntingdon_sprague_dawley_data/&gt;&lt;ref name=harlan_sprague_dawley_data/&gt; The Séralini experiment covered the normal lifespan of these rats. The longer an experiment continues, the more rats get cancer naturally, that makes it harder to separate statistical "noise" from the hypothetical signal. For the study to achieve such separation ([[statistical power]]), each control and test group would have to include sufficiently many subjects.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012/&gt; [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) guidelines recommend 20 rats for chemical-toxicity studies, and 50 rats for carcinogenicity studies.&lt;ref name=EFSA/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} In addition, if the survival of the rats is less than 50% at 104 weeks (which is likely for Sprague-Dawley rats) the recommended number of rats is 65.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="huntingdon_sprague_dawley_data"&gt;

Tom Sanders from [[King's College London]] noted a lack of data on amount of food given, and on growth rates, further noting that rats are susceptible to mammary tumors when food intake is not restricted. Sanders said, "The statistical methods are unconventional ... and it would appear the authors have gone on a statistical fishing trip."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland.

The ''Washington Post'' quoted [[Marion Nestle]], the [[Paulette Goddard]] professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at [[New York University]] and food safety advocate: "'[I] can't figure it out yet....It's weirdly complicated and unclear on key issues: what the controls were fed, relative rates of tumors, why no dose relationship, what the mechanism might be.

SFPT is "a non governmental/non profit organization formed by veterinarians, physicians, pharmacists and biologists specialized in veterinary and toxicologic pathology. Its aim is to promote knowledge in pathology, toxicology and laboratory animal sciences for safety studies of drugs, chemicals and food products, and the role of the pathologist in the study design and data interpretation."&lt;ref name="Barale-ThomasMarch2013" /&gt;  The letter criticized the Seralini study on several fronts, and concluded: "However, given this study presents serious deficiencies in the protocol, the procedures and the interpretation of the results, the SFPT cannot support any of the scientific claims drawn by the authors, and any relevance for human risk assessment. This letter presents the consensus scientific opinion of the Conseil d'Administration of the SFPT."&lt;ref name="Barale-ThomasMarch2013" /&gt;

The Belgian Federal Minister of Public Health asked the Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council (BBAC) to evaluate the paper. The BBAC was asked to "inform the Minister whether this paper (i) contains new scientific information with regard to risks for human health of GM maize NK603 and (ii) whether this information triggers a revision of the current authorisation for commercialisation for food and feed use of this GM maize in the European Union (EU)."&lt;ref name=Belgium&gt;Bioveiligheidsraad Conseil de Biosécurité (Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council) (2012).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Given the shortcomings identified by the experts regarding the experimental design, the statistical analysis, the interpretation of the results, the redaction of the article and the presentation of the results, the Biosafety Advisory Council concludes that this study does not contain new scientifically relevant elements that may lead to reconsider immediately the current authorisation for food and feed use of GM maize NK603. Considering the issues raised by the study (i.e. long term assessment), the Biosafety Advisory Council proposes EFSA urgently to study in depth the relevance of the actual guidelines and procedures. It can find inspiration in the GRACE project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grace-fp7.eu/|title=GRACE project|work=grace-fp7.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find useful information and new concerted ideas."&lt;ref name="Belgium"/&gt;{{rp|9}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The study was also criticized by the European Society of Toxicologic Pathology, which expressed shock at the way the rats in the study were treated and questioned whether the study was legal to perform under European law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomaeus|first1=A|last2=Parrott|first2=W|last3=Bondy|first3=G|last4=Walker|first4=K|last5=ILSI International Food Biotechnology Committee Task Force on Use of Mammalian Toxicology Studies in Safety Assessment of GM|first5=Foods|title=The use of whole food animal studies in the safety assessment of genetically modified crops: limitations and recommendations.|journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology|date=November 2013|volume=43 Suppl 2|pages=1–24|doi=10.3109/10408444.2013.842955|pmid=24164514|pmc=3833814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 reanalysis of multiple animal studies found that Seralini chose to forgo statistical tests in the main conclusions of the study. Using Seralini's published numerical data, the review found no [[Statistical significance|significant]] effects on animal health after analysis with [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]]. The finding that "in females, all the treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls" was not statistically significant. The highest mortality was observed for the group of female rats fed 22% genetically modified [[maize]]. This difference was not statistically significant. Seralini also originally claimed males in groups fed 22% and 33% genetically modified maize had three times lower mortality than controls, but this was also not statistically significant. The findings of liver necrosis and mammary tumors were also not significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Published GMO studies find no evidence of harm when corrected for multiple comparisons|journal = Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|date = 2016-01-14|issn = 0738-8551|pmid = 26767435|pages = 213–217|issue = 2|doi = 10.3109/07388551.2015.1130684|first1 = Alexander Y.|last1 = Panchin|first2 = Alexander I.|last2 = Tuzhikov|volume = 37|s2cid = 11786594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that since it was retracted, Seralini et al.

Séralini responded to criticisms of his methodology (and specifically a lack of difference between rodent groups at higher doses) with a July 2015 paper in ''[[PLOS ONE]]'' claiming that all laboratory rodent diets are contaminated with "dangerous" levels of GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mesnage |first1=R |last2=Defarge |first2=N |last3=Rocque |first3=LM |last4=Spiroux de Vendômois |first4=J |last5=Séralini |first5=GE |title=Laboratory Rodent Diets Contain Toxic Levels of Environmental Contaminants: Implications for Regulatory Tests. |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=2015 |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=e0128429 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0128429 |pmid=26133768 |pmc=4489719|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1028429M |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been strongly criticised by numerous experts,&lt;ref name="smc-plos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-investigating-content-of-and-contaminants-in-laboratory-rodent-diets/ |title=expert reaction to study investigating content of and contaminants in laboratory rodent diets |publisher=Science Media Center |date=2 July 2015 |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[Tamara Galloway]] said that the study "speculates beyond the evidence presented in this paper".&lt;ref name="news24-galloway"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/Green/News/Pesticides-in-lab-rat-feed-causes-a-stir-20150703 |title=Pesticides in lab rat feed causes a stir |work=news24.com |date=3 July 2015 |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Séralini supporters criticized the retraction of the study, concluding the response was a product of industry-driven campaign and regard this as a concerning example of industry interference in the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fagan|first1=John|last2=Traavik|first2=Terje|last3=Bøhn|first3=Thomas|title=The Seralini affair: degeneration of Science to Re-Science?|journal=Environmental Sciences Europe|date=29 August 2015|volume=27|issue=19|doi=10.1186/s12302-015-0049-2|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Officials ===
At the time of the initial release, [[French Prime Minister]] [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] said that, if the results are confirmed, the government would press for a Europe-wide ban on the maize and The [[European Commission]] instructed the EFSA in Parma, Italy, to assess the study.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012/&gt; In late September 2012, Russia temporarily suspended importing GM corn as a result of the study&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Phys.org.  26 September 2012  [http://phys.org/news/2012-09-russia-monsanto-corn-imports.html Russia suspends Monsanto corn imports]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in November 2012, Kenya banned all GM crops.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Willingham for Forbes.  9 December 2012.

=== Media ===
The press conference led to widespread negative media coverage for GM food, especially in Europe.&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012" /&gt; ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' covered the press conference in a story called, "Yes, GMOs are poisons!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/ogm-le-scandale/20120918.OBS2686/exclusif-oui-les-ogm-sont-des-poisons.html |author = Malaurie, Guillaume | title=EXCLUSIF.

[[Jon Entine]] in ''[[Forbes]]'' stated,  "Seralini's research is anomalous. Previous peer-reviewed rat feeding studies using the same products (NK603 and Roundup) have not found any negative food safety impacts. The Japanese Department of Environmental Health and Toxicology released a 52-week feeding study of GM soybeans in 2007, finding "no apparent adverse effect in rats." In 2012, a team of scientists at the University of Nottingham School of Biosciences released a review of 12 long-term studies (up to two years) and 12 multi-generational studies (up to 5 generations) of GM foods, concluding there is no evidence of health hazards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/09/30/does-the-seralini-corn-study-fiasco-mark-a-turning-point-in-the-debate-over-gm-food/|title=Does the Seralini Corn Study Fiasco Mark a Turning Point in the Debate Over GM Food? |access-date= 11 May 2013|work= Forbes.com|first=Jon|last=Entine|date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Revkin]] wrote in a blog the study was another instance of "single-study syndrome", and that the study was in support of an "agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C.

[[Henry I. Miller]], in an opinion piece for Forbes, said "[Seralini] has crossed the line from merely performing and reporting flawed experiments to committing gross [[scientific misconduct]] and attempting [[fraud]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/09/25/scientists-smell-a-rat-in-fraudulent-genetic-engineering-study/2/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929025756/http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/09/25/scientists-smell-a-rat-in-fraudulent-genetic-engineering-study/2/|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2012|title=Scientists Smell A Rat In Fraudulent Genetic Engineering Study | work=Forbes | format= opinion|first=Henry I.|last=Miller|date =25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Séralini responded by saying, "...that he won't make any data available to the EFSA and the BfR until the EFSA makes public all the data under-pinning its 2003 approval of NK603 maize for human consumption and animal feed."&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012"/&gt;

''The Guardian''{{'s}} Environmental Blog stated that the study linking GM maize to cancer "must be taken seriously by regulators" and that although it "attracted a torrent of abuse", "it cannot be swept under the carpet". They also noted CRIIGEN's funding of the research and reported Séralini's response: namely, that studies in support of GM food are usually funded by "corporates or by pro-biotech institutions".&lt;ref name=GuardianSeralini&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/study-gm-maize-cancer|title = Study linking GM maize to cancer must be taken seriously by regulators|access-date = 8 May 2013|work = The Guardian|location=London|first=John|last=Vidal|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of California's GM labeling referendum, Proposition 37, hailed the study.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Right to Know.[http://www.carighttoknow.org/tags/seralini Posts tagged Seralini]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405152715/http://www.carighttoknow.org/tags/seralini |date=5 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/business/energy-environment/disputed-study-links-modified-corn-to-greater-health-risks.html | title=Foes of Modified Corn Find Support in a Study | date=20 September 2012 | agency=New York Times | access-date=15 November 2014 | author=Pollack, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement about the controversy, and especially the attacks on Seralini, was published in ''[[Le Monde]],'' signed by 140 French scientists; the letter said:
{{quote|"...the protocol followed in this study presents problems that are subject to debate within the scientific community. ...}}

{{quote|We are deeply shocked by the image of our community that this controversy gives citizens. The discipline of risks to human health and the environment is a difficult activity which is done in the face of many uncertainties. Many of the threats to our planet have been revealed by individual scientists and then confirmed by many studies by the scientific community. In this case, it would be more effective to implement research on the health and environmental risks of GMOs and pesticides, improve toxicological protocols used before entry into the market, and finance a variety of researchers in this field than to create clashes between two camps fed on prejudices and ideologies.

=== Lawsuit ===
In 2012 Séralini sued the editor of ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'' and journalist Jean-Claude Jaillet for defamation after they accused him of fraud. The [[High Court of Paris]] ruled in Seralini's favor in 2015. The court said that the fraud allegation had first been made by  Henry I.

In November 2013, Elsevier announced that FCT was retracting the paper, after the authors refused to withdraw it.&lt;ref name="Elsevier2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casassus"&gt;Barbara Casassus for Nature News. 28 November 2013 [http://www.nature.com/news/study-linking-gm-maize-to-rat-tumours-is-retracted-1.14268 Study linking GM maize to rat tumours is retracted: Publisher withdraws paper over authors' objections, citing weak evidence]&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's editors concluded that while there was "no evidence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data", the results were inconclusive and "[did] not reach the threshold of publication for Food and Chemical Toxicology". After an in-depth look at the study's raw data, no definitive conclusions could be reached regarding the role of either NK603 or glyphosate in overall mortality or tumor rates, given the high incidence of tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats and the small sample size. Normal variance could not be excluded as the cause of the results.&lt;ref name="Elsevier2013" /&gt; Following many enquiries about the retraction, FCT's editor-in-chief said that:
{{Pull quote|The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant [[Committee on Publication Ethics|COPE]] guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (i.e., conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Séralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error. The review of the data made it clear that there was no misconduct. However, to be very clear, it is the entire paper, with the claim that there is a definitive link between GMO and cancer that is being retracted. Dr. Séralini has been very vocal that he believes his conclusions are correct. In our analysis, his conclusions cannot be claimed from the data presented in this article.|author=A.

On 1 August 2017, as part of a lawsuit against Monsanto, documents were released showing, among other things, that the Editor-in-Chief, Wallace Hayes, had once had a contractual relationship with Monsanto. Hayes said in an interview that he did not have a contract with Monsanto when he retracted Seralini's paper, and that his decision to retract it was not influenced by Monsanto at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/business/monsantos-sway-over-research-is-seen-in-disclosed-emails.html|title=Monsanto Emails Raise Issue of Influencing Research on Roundup Weed Killer|last=Hakim|first=Danny|date=2017-08-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the original study was republished with the addition of the entire data set, in the journal ''Environmental Sciences Europe''.&lt;ref name="SeraliniRepublish2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Séralini|first1=Gilles-Eric|last2=Clair|first2=Emilie|last3=Mesnage|first3=Robin|last4=Gress|first4=Steeve|last5=Defarge|first5=Nicolas|last6=Malatesta|first6=Manuela|last7=Hennequin|first7=Didier|last8=de Vendômois|first8=Joël|title=Republished study: long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize|journal=Environmental Sciences Europe|volume=26|issue=1|pages=14|doi=10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5|pmid=27752412|pmc=5044955|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casassus2"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-republished-1.15463 | title=Paper claiming GM link with tumours republished |  journal=Nature | date=26 June 2014 | access-date=26 June 2014 | author=Casassus, Barbara| doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15463 | s2cid=155666600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire data set was published because of requests from the national regulatory bodies [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency|CFIA]], [[EFSA]], [[FSANZ]], [[Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail|ANSES]] and [[BfR]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/genetically-modified-foods-other-novel-foods/canadian-food-inspection-agency-statement-seralini-2012-publication-2-year-rodent-feeding-study-glyphosate-formulations-maize-nk603.html canada.ca: "Health Canada and Canadian Food Inspection Agency statement on the Séralini et al. (2012) publication on a 2-year rodent feeding study with glyphosate formulations and GM maize NK603"], 25 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor said that the paper was republished without further scientific peer review, "because this had already been conducted by ''Food and Chemical Toxicology'', and had concluded there had been no fraud nor misrepresentation."&lt;ref name="Casassus2" /&gt; The republication renewed the controversy, but now with additional controversy over the behavior of the editors of both journals.&lt;ref&gt;Science Media Centre.  25 June 2014.

In July 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] published a monograph on glyphosate, which contained an evaluation of the Séralini paper as republished in June 2014 and the conclusion, that the study "was inadequate for evaluation because the number of animals per group was small, the histopathological description of tumours was poor, and incidences of tumours for individual animals were not provided."&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol112/mono112-10.pdf IARC monograph on glyphosate, p. 355, right column]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''serotype''' or '''serovar''' is a distinct variation within a [[species]] of [[bacteria]] or [[virus]] or among [[immune cells]] of different individuals. These [[microorganism]]s, viruses, or [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s are classified together based on their surface [[antigen]]s, allowing the epidemiologic classification of organisms to the subspecies level.&lt;ref name=Barron&gt;{{cite book | author =  Baron EJ | title = Classification.

Could use an example here.|date=December 2020}}

Serotyping often plays an essential role in determining species and subspecies. The ''[[Salmonella]]'' [[genus]] of bacteria, for example, has been determined to have over 2600 serotypes. ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', the species of bacteria that causes [[cholera]], has over 200 serotypes, based on cell antigens. Only two of them have been observed to produce the potent [[enterotoxin]] that results in cholera: O1 and O139.{{cn|date=August 2021}}

Serotypes were discovered by the American microbiologist [[Rebecca Lancefield]] in 1933.&lt;ref name=Lancefield_1933&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lancefield RC | title =  A Serological Differentiation of Human and Other Groups of Hemolytic Streptococci | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 571–95 | date = March 1933 | pmid = 19870148 | pmc = 2132252 | doi = 10.1084/jem.57.4.571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in organ transplantation==
[[File:Anti-HLA agglutinated RBC.png|frame|right|Agglutination of [[HLA-A3]] positive [[red blood cell]]s with anti-A3 alloreactive [[antisera]] containing Anti-A3 [[IgM]]]]

The [[immune system]] is capable of discerning a cell as being 'self' or 'non-self' according to that cell's serotype. In humans, that serotype is largely determined by [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA), the human version of the [[major histocompatibility complex]]. Cells determined to be non-self are usually recognized by the immune system as foreign, causing an immune response, such as [[hemagglutination]]. Serotypes differ widely between individuals; therefore, if cells from one human (or animal) are introduced into another random human, those cells are often determined to be non-self because they do not match the self-serotype. For this reason, transplants between genetically non-identical humans often induce a problematic immune response in the recipient, leading to [[transplant rejection]]. In some situations, this effect can be reduced by serotyping both recipient and potential donors to determine the closest HLA match.&lt;ref name="pmid11158412"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frohn C, Fricke L, Puchta JC, Kirchner H | title = The effect of HLA-C matching on acute renal transplant rejection | journal = Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 355–60 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11158412 | doi = 10.1093/ndt/16.2.355 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Serotyping of ''Salmonella'' ==
The [[Kauffman–White classification]] scheme is the basis for naming the manifold serovars of ''Salmonella''. To date, more than 2600 different serotypes have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gal-Mor O, Boyle EC, Grassl GA | title = Same species, different diseases: how and why typhoidal and non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars differ | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 5 | pages = 391 | pmid = 25136336 | pmc = 4120697 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2014.00391 | year = 2014 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Salmonella'' serotype is determined by the unique combination of reactions of cell surface [[antigens]]. The "O" antigen is determined by the outermost portion of the [[lipopolysaccharide]] and the "H" antigen is based on the flagellar (protein) antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serotypes and the Importance of Serotyping Salmonella|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reportspubs/salmonella-atlas/serotyping-importance.html|website=CDC|access-date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two species of ''Salmonella'': ''[[Salmonella bongori]]'' and ''[[Salmonella enterica]]''. ''Salmonella enterica'' can be subdivided into six subspecies.
The process to identify the serovar of the bacterium consists of finding the formula of surface antigens which represent the variations of the bacteria.  The traditional method for determining the antigen formula is [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reactions on [[Microscope slide|slides]]. The agglutination between the antigen and the [[antibody]] is made with a specific [[antisera]], which reacts with the antigen to produce a mass. The antigen O is tested with a bacterial suspension from an [[agar plate]], whereas the antigen H is tested with a bacterial suspension from a broth culture. The scheme classifies the serovar depending on its antigen formula obtained via the agglutination reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Danan C, Fremy S, Moury F, Bohnert ML, Brisabois A | title = Determining the serotype of isolated Salmonella strains in the veterinary sector using the rapid slide agglutination test. | journal = J.

[[Chloride]] is an [[anion]] in the human body needed for metabolism (the process of turning food into energy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_schlorid_crs.htm |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331211149/http://med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_schlorid_crs.htm|title=Blood (Serum) Chloride Level Test  |archivedate=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also helps keep the body's acid-base balance. The amount of '''serum chloride''' is carefully [[renal chloride reabsorption|controlled by the kidneys]].&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical Methods: The History, Physical, and Laboratory Examinations. 3rd edition.|first1=Gail|last1=Morrison|publisher=Butterworth Publishers|date=1990 |pmid=21250151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chloride ions have important [[physiology|physiological]] roles. For instance, in the [[central nervous system]], the inhibitory action of [[glycine]] and some of the action of [[GABA]] relies on the entry of Cl&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; into specific neurons.  Also, the [[chloride-bicarbonate exchanger]] biological transport [[protein]] relies on the chloride ion to increase the [[blood]]'s capacity of [[carbon dioxide]], in the form of the [[bicarbonate]] ion; this is the mechanism underpinning the [[chloride shift]] occurring as the blood passes through oxygen-consuming capillary beds.

The normal [[blood values|blood reference range]] of chloride for adults in most labs is 96 to 106 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|milliequivalents]] (mEq) per liter. The normal range may vary slightly from lab to lab. Normal ranges are usually shown next to results in the lab report. A diagnostic test may use a [[chloridometer]] to determine the serum chloride level.

The North American [[Dietary Reference Intake]] recommends a daily intake of between 2300 and 3600&amp;nbsp;mg/day for 25-year-old males.

{{Other uses|Sessility (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|Generally sessile ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' attached to a substrate]]

'''Sessility''' is the [[biology|biological]] property of an [[organism]] describing its lack of a means of self-locomotion. Sessile organisms for which natural ''[[motility]]'' is absent are normally immobile. This is distinct from the botanical concept of [[Sessility (botany)|sessility]], which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk.

Sessile organisms can move via external forces (such as water currents), but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as [[coral]]s lay down their own [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] from which they grow. Other sessile organisms grow from a solid such as a rock, dead tree trunk, or a man-made object such as a buoy or ship's hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=2016|isbn=9781497006515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility==
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. [[Sponge]]s have a motile [[larval]] stage and become sessile at maturity. Conversely, many [[jellyfish]] develop as sessile [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s early in their life cycle. In the case of the [[cochineal]], it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host.

==Reproduction==
Many sessile animals, including sponges, [[coral]]s and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], are capable of [[asexual reproduction]] ''[[in situ]]'' by the process of [[budding]]. Sessile organisms such as [[barnacle]]s and [[tunicate]]s need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the [[evolution]] of a [[larva]]l stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Biologist [[Wayne Sousa]]'s 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, "suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Wayne P. |last=Sousa |title=Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium Maintenance of Species Diversity |journal=Ecology |volume=60 |issue=6 |year=1979 |pages=1225–1239 |doi=10.2307/1936969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clumping==
{{Main Article|Clumping (biology)}}
[[File:Blue mussel clump.jpg|thumb|280px|Blue mussels, ''[[Mytilus edulis]]'', are sessile and exhibit clumping]]

Clumping is a behavior in sessile organisms in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, as can be seen in [[coral reef]]s and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates|author=James H. Thorp|author2=Alan P. Covich |publisher=[[Academic Press]]|page=213|date=2001|isbn=0-12-690647-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj2ZMSekmHEC&amp;q=Sessile+Limnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predominance in coastal environments==
The [[littoral zone|circalittoral zone]] of [[coast]]al environments and [[biome]]s are dominated by sessile organisms such as [[oyster]]s. [[Carbonate platform]]s grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually [[microorganism]]s, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism.

==Botanical sessility==
In anatomy and botany, ''sessility'' refers to an organism or biological structure that has no ''peduncle'' or stalk. A sessile structure has no stalk.

''See'': [[peduncle (anatomy)]], [[peduncle (botany)]] and [[sessility (botany)]].

'''Seth Lloyd''' (born August 2, 1960) is a [[professor]] of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[physics]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

His research area is the interplay of [[information]] with [[complex systems]], especially [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] systems. He has performed seminal work in the fields of [[quantum computation]], [[quantum communication]] and [[quantum biology]], including proposing the first technologically feasible design for a [[quantum computer]], demonstrating the viability of quantum analog computation, proving quantum analogs of [[Shannon's noisy channel theorem]], and designing novel methods for [[quantum error correction]] and noise reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://news.mit.edu/2015/seth-lloyd-appointed-nam-suh-professor-mechanical-engineering-0831 |title=Seth Lloyd, leading quantum mechanics expert, appointed Nam P. Suh Professor|last=MIT News Office|date=2015-08-31|language=en|access-date=2020-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lloyd was born on August 2, 1960.  He graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in 1978 and received a bachelor of arts degree from [[Harvard College]] in 1982. He earned a certificate of advanced study in mathematics and a master of philosophy degree from [[Cambridge University]] in 1983 and 1984, while on a [[Marshall Scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=OYSI |url=http://oysi.org/people/entry/seth-lloyd |access-date=2022-05-23 |website=oysi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd was awarded a doctorate by [[Rockefeller University]] in 1988 (advisor [[Heinz Pagels]]) after submitting a thesis on ''Black Holes, Demons, and the Loss of Coherence: How Complex Systems Get Information, and What They Do With It.''

From 1988 to 1991, Lloyd was a postdoctoral fellow in the High Energy Physics Department at the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he worked with [[Murray Gell-Mann]] on applications of information to quantum-mechanical systems. From 1991 to 1994, he was a postdoctoral fellow at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], where he worked at the Center for Nonlinear Systems on quantum computation. In 1994, he joined the faculty of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at [[MIT]]. Starting in 1988, Lloyd was an external faculty member at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] for more than 30 years.

In his 2006 book, ''[[Programming the Universe]]'', Lloyd contends that the universe itself is one big [[quantum computer]] producing what we see around us, and ourselves, as it runs a cosmic [[computer program|program]]. According to Lloyd, once we understand the laws of [[physics]] completely, we will be able to use small-scale quantum computing to understand the universe completely as well.

Lloyd states that we could have the whole universe simulated in a computer in 600 years provided that computational power increases according to [[Moore's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/seth_lloyd-the-computational-universe |title=THE COMPUTATIONAL UNIVERSE |last=Lloyd |first=Seth |date=20 October 2002 |website=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |access-date=7 October 2020 |quote='Every physical system registers information, and just by evolving in time, by doing its thing, it changes that information&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Lloyd shows that there are limits to rapid [[exponential growth]] in a finite universe, and that it is very unlikely that Moore's Law will be maintained indefinitely.

Lloyd is principal investigator at the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics, and directs the [http://www.rle.mit.edu/xqit Center for Extreme Quantum Information Theory] (xQIT) at MIT. His most recent work has focused on the role of quantum phenomena such as [[quantum coherence|coherence]] in biological phenomena, especially photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Seth|date=2011|title=Quantum coherence in biological systems|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|language=en|volume=302|issue=1|pages=012037|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/302/1/012037|issn=1742-6596|bibcode=2011JPhCS.302a2037L|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd2014"&gt;{{cite speech

==Epstein affair==
During July 2019, reports surfaced that MIT and other institutions had accepted funding from convicted sex offender [[Jeffrey Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeffrey Epstein Called Himself A "Science Philanthropist" And Donated Millions To These Researchers|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-science-donations|access-date=2020-01-27|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|date=2019-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing scandal,&lt;ref name="factfindingmit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfindingjan2020.mit.edu/|access-date=2020-01-27|title=MIT and Jeffrey Epstein|website=factfinding2020.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the director of the [[MIT Media Lab]], [[Joi Ito]], resigned from MIT as a result of his association with Epstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/business/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joichi-ito.html|work=The New York Times|title=Director of M.I.T.'s Media Lab Resigns After Taking Money From Jeffrey Epstein|last1=Tracy|first1=Marc|last2=Hsu|first2=Tiffany|date=7 September 2019 |access-date=2020-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd's connections to Epstein also drew criticism: Lloyd had acknowledged receiving funding from Epstein in 19 of his papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/business/epstein-mit-media-lab.html |title = Jeffrey Epstein Donations to M.I.T.

As a result of the report, on January 10, 2020, Lloyd was placed on [[administrative leave|paid administrative leave]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-releases-results-fact-finding-report-jeffrey-epstein-0110|title=MIT releases results of fact-finding on engagements with Jeffrey Epstein|last=MIT News Office|date=2020-01-10|language=en|access-date=2020-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lloyd has vigorously denied that he misled MIT about the source of the funds he received from Epstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@sqlloyd/what-i-told-mit-about-epsteins-donations-feec0beb26a|first=Seth|last=Lloyd|title=What I told MIT about Epstein's donations|website=medium.com|access-date=2020-01-27|date=2020-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This denial was validated by a subsequent MIT investigation that concluded that Lloyd did not attempt to circumvent the MIT vetting process, nor try to conceal the name of the donor, and Lloyd was allowed to continue his tenured faculty position at MIT.&lt;ref name="masslive"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.masslive.com/boston/2020/12/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-disciplining-professor-with-ties-to-disgraced-financier-jeffrey-epstein.html|title=Massachusetts Institute of Technology disciplining professor with ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein|last=Stening|first=Tanner|access-date=2020-12-20|work=MassLive|language=en|date=2020-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most but not all members of MIT's fact-finding committee concluded that Lloyd had violated MIT's conflict of interest policy by not revealing crucial publicly known information about Epstein's background to MIT, as a result of which Lloyd will be subject to a series of administrative actions for 5 years.&lt;ref name="masslive" /&gt;

A living thing's sex is determined by its genes.  Most [[mammal]]s have the [[XY sex-determination system]], where male mammals usually carry an X and a [[Y chromosome]] (XY), whereas female mammals usually carry two [[X chromosome]]s (XX). Other chromosomal [[sex-determination system]]s in animals include the [[ZW sex-determination system|ZW system]] in birds, and the [[X0 sex-determination system|X0 system]] in insects.

==Sexual reproduction==
{{Main|Sexual reproduction}} {{Further|Isogamy|Anisogamy}}
[[File:Sexual cycle.svg|thumb|The life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms cycles through haploid and diploid stages]]

Sexual reproduction is a process exclusive to [[eukaryote]]s in which organisms produce offspring that possess a selection of the genetic traits of each parent. Genetic traits are contained within the [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) of [[chromosome]]s. The cells of eukaryotes have a set of paired [[homologous chromosomes]], one from each parent, and this double-chromosome  stage is called "[[diploid]]". During sexual reproduction, diploid organisms produce specialized [[haploid]] sex cells called [[gametes]] via [[meiosis]],&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), "V. 20. Meiosis", U.S. NIH, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26840/ V. 20. Meiosis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125115052/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26840/ |date=25 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which has a single set of chromosomes. Meiosis involves a stage of [[genetic recombination]]  via [[chromosomal crossover]], in which regions of DNA are exchanged between matched pairs of chromosomes, to form new chromosomes each with a new and unique combination of the genes of the parents. Then the chromosomes are separated into single sets in the gametes. Each gamete in the offspring thus has half of the genetic material of the mother and half of the father.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), U.S. National Institutes of Health, "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3678 V. 20. The Benefits of Sex] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522095113/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3678 |date=22 May 2009 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of chromosomal crossover and [[fertilization]], bringing the two single sets of chromosomes together to make a new diploid [[zygote]], results in new organisms that contain different sets of the genetic traits of each parent.

In [[animal]]s, the haploid stage only occurs in the gametes, the haploid cells that are specialized to fuse to form a zygote that develops into a new diploid organism. In [[plant]]s, the diploid organism produces haploid [[spore]]s by meiosis that are capable of undergoing repeated [[mitosis|cell division]] to produce [[multicellular]] haploid organisms. In either case, gametes may be externally similar ([[isogamy]]) as in the green alga ''[[Ulva]]'' or may be different in size and other aspects ([[anisogamy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert (2000), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10031 "1.2. Multicellularity: Evolution of Differentiation". 1.2.Mul] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308143406/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10031/ |date=8 March 2021 }}, NIH.&lt;/ref&gt;  The size difference is greatest in [[oogamy]], a type of anisogamy in which a small, [[motile]] gamete combines with a much larger, non-motile gamete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzZGQOmcjqAC&amp;q=a%20dictionary%20of%20plant%20sciences%20oogamy&amp;pg=PA350|title=A Dictionary of Plant Sciences|vauthors=Allaby M|date=2012-03-29|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-960057-1|page=350|language=en|author-link=Michael Allaby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, the larger gamete (called an [[ovum]], or egg cell) is considered female, while the smaller gamete (called a spermatozoon, or sperm cell) is considered male. An individual that produces exclusively large gametes is female, and one that produces exclusively small gametes is male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gee |first1=Henry |title=Size and the single sex cell |url=https://www.nature.com/news/1999/991122/full/news991125-4.html |access-date=4 June 2018 |work=Nature |date=22 November 1999 |ref=10.1038/news991125-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual that produces both types of gametes is a [[hermaphrodite]]. In some cases hermaphrodites are able to [[self-fertilization|self-fertilize]] and produce offspring on their own, without the need of a partner.

===Animals===
{{Main|Sexual reproduction#Animals}}
[[File:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating]]

Most sexually reproducing animals spend their lives as diploid, with the haploid stage reduced to single-cell gametes.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), "3. Mendelian genetics in eukaryotic life cycles", U.S. NIH, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21836 3. Mendelian/eukaryotic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402185423/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21836/ |date=2 April 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The gametes of animals have male and female forms—[[spermatozoa]] and egg cells. These gametes combine to form embryos which develop into new organisms.

The male gamete, a [[spermatozoon]] (produced in vertebrates within the [[testes]]), is a small cell containing a single long [[flagellum]] which propels it.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), "V.20. Sperm", U.S. NIH, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3729 V.20. Sperm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629222617/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3729 |date=29 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Spermatozoa are extremely reduced cells, lacking many cellular components that would be necessary for embryonic development. They are specialized for motility, seeking out an egg cell and fusing with it in a process called [[Fertilization#Fertilisation in animals|fertilization]].

Female gametes are egg cells. In vertebrates they are produced within the [[ovary|ovaries]]. They are large immobile cells that contain the nutrients and cellular components necessary for a developing embryo.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), "V.20. Eggs", U.S. NIH, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3718 V.20. Eggs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629074430/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3718 |date=29 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Egg cells are often associated with other cells which support the development of the embryo, forming an [[Egg (biology)|egg]]. In mammals, the fertilized embryo instead develops within the female, receiving nutrition directly from its mother.

Animals are usually&lt;!--h'm. but not Sponges, Corals, Bryozoa, Barnacles, ...--&gt; mobile and seek out a partner of the opposite sex for [[mating]]. Animals which live in the water can mate using [[external fertilization]], where the eggs and sperm are released into and combine within the surrounding water.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), "V.20. Fertilization", U.S. NIH, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3738 V.20. Fertilization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219005819/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3738 |date=19 December 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most animals that live outside of water, however, use [[internal fertilization]], transferring sperm directly into the female to prevent the gametes from drying up.&lt;!--Dragonflies use indirect method, transferring a spermatheca.--&gt;

In most birds, both excretion and reproduction is done through a single posterior opening, called the [[cloaca]]—male and female birds touch cloaca to transfer sperm, a process called "cloacal kissing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Avian Reproduction |url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/avianreproduction.html |publisher=Eastern Kentucky University |last=Ritchison |first=G. |access-date=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many other terrestrial animals, males use specialized [[sex organ]]s to assist the transport of sperm—these male sex organs are called [[intromittent organ]]s. In humans and other mammals this male organ is the [[penis]], which enters the female reproductive tract (called the [[vagina]]) to achieve [[insemination]]—a process called [[sexual intercourse]]. The penis contains a tube through which [[semen]] (a fluid containing sperm) travels. In female mammals the vagina connects with the [[uterus]], an organ which directly supports the development of a fertilized embryo within (a process called [[gestation]]).

Because of their motility, [[animal sexual behavior]] can involve coercive sex. [[Traumatic insemination]], for example, is used by some insect species to inseminate females through a wound in the abdominal cavity—a process detrimental to the female's health.

===Plants===
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|300px|Flowers contain the sexual organs of flowering plants, usually containing both male and female parts.]]

{{Main|Plant reproduction}}

Like animals, [[land plants]] have specialized male and female gametes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gilbert SF | date = 2000 | chapter = Gamete Production in Angiosperms | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10129/ | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | location = Sunderland (MA) | publisher = Sinauer Associates | isbn = 978-0-87893-243-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCrimQJu1RAC&amp;q=living+at+micro+scale+reproduction&amp;pg=PA308|title=Living at Micro Scale: The Unexpected Physics of Being Small|vauthors=Dusenbery DB|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03116-6|pages=308–326|language=en|author-link=David B. Dusenbery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]], male gametes are produced by reduced male [[gametophytes]] that are contained within hard coats, forming [[pollen]]. The female gametes of seed plants are contained within [[ovule]]s. Once fertilized these form [[seed]]s which, like eggs, contain the nutrients necessary for the initial development of the embryonic plant.

&lt;div class="thumb tright" style="background:#f9f9f9; border:1px solid #ccc; margin:0.5em;"&gt;

|}
&lt;div style="border: none; width:260px;" class="thumbcaption"&gt;Female (left) and male (right) cones contain the sex organs of pines and other conifers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The [[flower]]s of [[flowering plant]]s contain their sexual organs. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, containing both male and female sexual organs. The female parts, in the center of a flower, are the [[pistils]], each unit consisting of a [[carpel]], a [[Style (botany)|style]] and a [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. Two or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound [[pistil]], the fused carpels forming an [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]]. Within the carpels are [[ovules]] which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the [[stamen]]s: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in [[Glossary of botanical terms#anther|anthers]] at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a [[pollen tube]] that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.

Some hermaphroditic plants are self-fertile, but plants have evolved multiple different [[self-incompatibility]] mechanisms to avoid self-fertilization, involving [[sequential hermaphroditism]], molecular recognition systems and morphological mechanisms such as [[heterostyly]].&lt;ref name="Judd"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Walter S.|last1=Judd|first2=Christopher S.|last2=Campbell |first3=Elizabeth A. |last3=Kellogg |first4=Peter F. |last4=Stevens |first5=Michael J. |last5=Donoghue |title=Plant systematics, a phylogenetic approach |edition=2 |date=2002 |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |location=Sunderland MA, USA |isbn=0-87893-403-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73,74}}

In [[pine]]s and other [[conifer]]s the sex organs are produced within [[conifer cone|cones]] that have male and female forms. Male cones are smaller than female ones and produce pollen which is transported by wind to land in female cones. The larger and longer-lived female cones are typically more durable, and contain ovules within them that develop into seeds after fertilization.

Because [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]] are immobile, they depend upon passive methods for transporting pollen grains to other plants. Many, including conifers and grasses, produce lightweight pollen which is carried by wind to neighboring plants. Some flowering plants have heavier, sticky pollen that is specialized for transportation by insects or larger animals such as [[humming birds]] and [[bats]], which may be attracted to flowers containing rewards of nectar and pollen. These animals transport the pollen as they move to other flowers, which also contain female reproductive organs, resulting in [[pollination]].

===Fungi===
{{Main|Mating in fungi}}
[[File:Shiitake mushroom.jpg|thumb|Mushrooms are produced as part of fungal sexual reproduction]]

Most [[fungus|fungi]] reproduce sexually and have both haploid and diploid stages in their life cycles. These fungi are typically [[isogamy|isogamous]], lacking male and female specialization: haploid fungi grow into contact with each other and then fuse their cells. In some of these cases, the fusion is asymmetric, and the cell which donates only a nucleus (and not accompanying cellular material) could arguably be considered "male".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nick Lane |title=Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life |url=https://archive.org/details/powersexsuicidem0000lane |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/powersexsuicidem0000lane/page/236 236–237] |isbn=978-0-19-280481-5 |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi may also have more complex allelic mating systems, with other sexes not accurately described as male, female, or hermaphroditic.&lt;ref name="Watkinson Boddy Money 2015 p. 115"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x8qcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|title=The Fungi|vauthors=Watkinson SC, [[Lynne Boddy|Boddy L]], Money N|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2015|isbn=978-0-12-382035-8|page=115|access-date=Feb 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226085333/https://books.google.com/books?id=x8qcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|archive-date=26 February 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fungi, including [[baker's yeast]], have [[mating type]]s that create a duality similar to male and female roles. Yeast with the same mating type will not fuse with each other to form diploid cells, only with yeast carrying the other mating type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew P. Scott |author2=Paul Matsudaira |author3=Harvey Lodish |author4=James Darnell |author5=Lawrence Zipursky |author6=Chris A.

Many species of [[Dikarya|higher fungi]] produce [[mushroom]]s as part of their [[Fungus#Reproduction|sexual reproduction]]. Within the mushroom diploid cells are formed, later dividing into haploid [[spore]]s. The height of the mushroom aids the [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] of these sexually produced offspring.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Sex-determination systems ==
{{Main|Sex-determination system}}
[[File:Evolsex-dia2a.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sex helps the spread of advantageous traits through recombination. The diagrams compare the evolution of allele frequency in a sexual population (top) and an asexual population (bottom). The vertical axis shows frequency and the horizontal axis shows time. The alleles a/A and b/B occur at random. The advantageous alleles A and B, arising independently, can be rapidly combined by sexual reproduction into the most advantageous combination AB. Asexual reproduction takes longer to achieve this combination because it can only produce AB if A arises in an individual which already has B or vice versa.]]

The biological cause of an organism developing into one sex or the other is called ''sex determination''.  The cause may be genetic, environmental, [[haplodiploidy]], or multiple factors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Within animals and other organisms that have genetic sex-determination systems, the determining factor may be the presence of a [[sex chromosome]]. In plants that are sexually dimorphic, such as ''Ginkgo biloba'',&lt;ref name="Judd"/&gt;{{rp|203}} the liverwort ''[[Marchantia polymorpha]]'' or the dioecious species in the flowering plant genus ''[[Silene]]'', sex may also be determined by sex chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Tanurdzic"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanurdzic M, Banks JA | title = Sex-determining mechanisms in land plants | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 16 Suppl | pages = S61-71 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15084718 | pmc = 2643385 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.016667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-genetic systems may use environmental cues, such as the [[Temperature-dependent sex determination|temperature]] during early development in [[crocodile]]s, to determine the sex of the offspring.&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warner DA, Shine R | title = The adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination in a reptile | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 566–8 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18204437 | doi = 10.1038/nature06519 | bibcode = 2008Natur.451..566W | s2cid = 967516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex-determination system|Sex determination]] is often distinct from [[Sexual differentiation|sex differentiation]]. Sex determination is the designation for the development stage towards either male or female while sex differentiation is the pathway towards the development of the [[phenotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Beukeboom LW, Perrin N |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yrnAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=the+evolution+of+sex+determination|title=The Evolution of Sex Determination |date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965714-8|pages=16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drosophila XY sex-determination.svg|thumb|Like humans and most other mammals, the common fruit fly has an [[XY sex-determination system]].]]

==== XY sex determination ====
Humans and most other [[mammal]]s have an [[XY sex-determination system]]: the [[Y chromosome]] carries factors responsible for triggering male development, making XY sex determination mostly based on the presence or absence of the [[Y chromosome]]. It is the male [[gamete]] that determines the sex of the offspring.&lt;ref name="pmid18581056"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wallis MC, Waters PD, Graves JA|date=October 2008|title=Sex determination in mammals--before and after the evolution of SRY|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=65|issue=20|pages=3182–95|doi=10.1007/s00018-008-8109-z|pmid=18581056|s2cid=31675679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system XX mammals typically are female and XY typically are male.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, individuals with [[Klinefelter syndrome|XXY]] or [[XYY syndrome|XYY]] are males, while individuals with [[Turner syndrome|X]] and [[Triple X syndrome|XXX]] are females.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Unusually, the [[platypus]], a [[monotreme]] mammal, has ten sex chromosomes; females have ten X chromosomes, and males have five X chromosomes and five Y chromosomes.

==== ZW sex determination ====
In birds, which have a [[ZW sex-determination system]], the W chromosome carries factors responsible for female development, and default development is male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith CA, Katz M, Sinclair AH | title = DMRT1 is upregulated in the gonads during female-to-male sex reversal in ZW chicken embryos | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 560–70 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12533420 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.102.007294 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female. It is the female [[gamete]] that determines the sex of the offspring. This system is used by birds, some fish, and some [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The majority of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]] also have a ZW sex-determination system. Females can have Z, ZZW, and even ZZWW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Majerus ME | author-link = Michael Majerus |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vDHOYPQ2mmYC&amp;q=ZW+sex+determination|title=Sex Wars: Genes, Bacteria, and Biased Sex Ratios|date=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00981-0|pages=59|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== XO sex determination ====
In the [[X0 sex-determination system]], males have one X chromosome (X0) while females have two (XX). All other chromosomes in these diploid organisms are paired, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes. This system is found in most [[arachnid]]s, insects such as [[silverfish]] ([[Apterygota]]), [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] ([[Paleoptera]]) and [[grasshopper]]s ([[Exopterygota]]), and some nematodes, crustaceans, and gastropods.&lt;ref name="Evolution"&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution of sex determining mechanisms|vauthors=Bull JJ|year=1983|isbn=0-8053-0400-2|page=17|author-link=James J.

In the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', most worms are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites with an XX karyotype, but occasional abnormalities in chromosome inheritance can give rise to individuals with only one X chromosome—these X0 individuals are fertile males (and half their offspring are male).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''C. elegans'' II|vauthors=[[Barbara J.

==== ZO sex determination ====
{{One source section

In the [[Z0 sex-determination system]], males have two Z chromosomes whereas females have one.

===Environmental===
{{main|Environmental sex determination}}

For many species, sex is not determined by inherited traits,{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} but instead by environmental factors such as temperature experienced during development or later in life.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

In the [[fern]] ''[[Ceratopteris]]'' and other [[Glossary of botanical terms#homosporous|homosporous]] fern species, the default sex is hermaphrodite, but individuals which grow in soil that has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by the [[pheromone]] [[antheridiogen]] to develop as male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanurdzic M, Banks JA | title = Sex-determining mechanisms in land plants | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 16 Suppl | issue = Suppl | pages = S61-71 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15084718 | pmc = 2643385 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.016667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bonelliidae|bonelliidae larvae]] can only develop as males when they encounter a female.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Sequential hermaphroditism ====
[[File:Ocellaris clownfish.JPG|thumb|[[Clownfish]]es are initially male; the largest fish in a group becomes female]]

Some species can change sex over the course of their lifespan, a phenomenon called [[sequential hermaphroditism]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Fusco G, Minelli A |author-link2=Alessandro Minelli (biologist) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKGsDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=sequential+hermaphroditism+in+plants|title=The Biology of Reproduction |date=2019-10-10|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-49985-9|pages=124|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teleost fishes are the only vertebrate [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] where sequential hermaphroditism occurs.

==== Temperature-dependent sex determination ====
Many [[reptile]]s, including all [[crocodile]]s and most turtles, have temperature-dependent sex determination. In these species, the temperature experienced by the embryos during their development determines their sex.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In some [[turtle]]s, for example, males are produced at lower temperatures than females; but ''[[Alligator snapping turtle|Macroclemys]]'' females are produced at temperatures lower than 22&amp;nbsp;°C or above 28&amp;nbsp;°C, while males are produced in between those temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author-link=Scott F.

Freeman|isbn=978-1-4292-3252-4|pages=74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] has stated that it is possible to interpret all the differences between the sexes as stemming from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekonDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=the+selfish+gene+battle+of+the+sexes+2016|title=The Selfish Gene|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878860-7|pages=183–184|language=en|quote=However, there is one fundamental feature of the sexes which can be used to label males as males, and females as females, throughout animals and plants. This is that the sex cells or 'gametes' of males are much smaller and more numerous than the gametes of females. This is true whether we are dealing with animals or plants. One group of individuals has large sex cells, and it is convenient to use the word female for them. The other group, which it is convenient to call male, has small sex cells. The difference is especially pronounced in reptiles and in birds, where a single egg cell is big enough and nutritious enough to feed a developing baby for. Even in humans, where the egg is microscopic, it is still many times larger than the sperm. As we shall see, it is possible to interpret all the other differences between the sexes as stemming from this one basic difference.|author-link=Richard Dawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex differences in humans]] include a generally larger size and more body hair in men, while women have larger breasts, wider hips, and a higher body fat percentage. In other species, there may be differences in coloration or other features, and may be so pronounced that the different sexes may be mistaken for two entirely different taxa.&lt;ref name="CogBeh"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last1=Mori|first1=Emiliano|title=Sexual Dimorphism|date=2017|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-47829-6_433-1|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Animal Cognition and Behavior|pages=1–7|editor-last=Vonk|editor-first=Jennifer|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-47829-6_433-1|isbn=978-3-319-47829-6|access-date=2021-06-05|last2=Mazza|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Lovari|first3=Sandro|editor2-last=Shackelford|editor2-first=Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
{{Main|Sexual dimorphism}}
[[File:Male and female pheasant.jpg|thumb|[[Common pheasant]]s are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] in both size and appearance.]]
In many animals and some plants, individuals of male and female sex differ in size and appearance, a phenomenon called [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior|vauthors=Choe J|date=2019-01-21|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-813252-4|veditors=Cox R|volume=2|pages=7–11|language=en|chapter=Body Size and Sexual Dimorphism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5lnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual dimorphism in animals is often associated with [[sexual selection]]—the mating competition between individuals of one sex vis-à-vis the opposite sex.&lt;ref name="CogBeh" /&gt; In many cases, the male of a species is larger than the female. Mammal species with extreme sexual size dimorphism tend to have highly [[Polygyny|polygynous]] mating systems—presumably due to selection for success in [[intraspecific competition|competition]] with other males—such as the [[elephant seal]]s. Other examples demonstrate that it is the preference of females that drives sexual dimorphism, such as in the case of the [[stalk-eyed fly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Wilkinson GS, Reillo PR |date=22 January 1994|title=Female choice response to artificial selection on an exaggerated male trait in a stalk-eyed fly|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~curtweb/L567/readings/Wilkinson_%26_Reillo_1994.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=225|issue=1342|pages=1–6|bibcode=1994RSPSB.255....1W|citeseerx=10.1.1.574.2822|doi=10.1098/rspb.1994.0001|s2cid=5769457|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910164858/http://www.indiana.edu/~curtweb/L567/readings/Wilkinson_%26_Reillo_1994.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females are the larger sex in a majority of animals.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For instance, female [[southern black widow]] spiders are typically twice as long as the males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Drees BM, Jackman J | date = 1999 | publisher = Gulf Publishing Company | location = Houston, Texas | chapter = Southern black widow spider | title = Field Guide to Texas Insects | chapter-url=http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg368.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030831114452/http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg368.html|archive-date=31 August 2003|access-date=8 August 2012| via = Extension Entomology, Insects.tamu.edu, Texas A&amp;M University }}&lt;/ref&gt; This size disparity may be associated with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm: larger females are able to produce more eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is fecundity the ultimate cause of female-biased size dimorphism in a dragon lizard? |vauthors=Stuart-Smith J, Swain R, Stuart-Smith R, Wapstra E |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=273 |issue=3 |year=2007 |pages=266–272 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00324.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Sexual dimorphism can be extreme, with males, such as some [[anglerfish]], living [[parasite|parasitically]] on the female. Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss genus ''[[Dicranum]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Shaw AJ |year=2000 |chapter=Population ecology, population genetics, and microevolution |pages=379–380 | veditors = Shaw AJ, Goffinet B |title=Bryophyte Biology |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-66097-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the liverwort genus ''[[Sphaerocarpos]]''.&lt;ref name="Schuster 1984"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Schuster RM |year=1984 |chapter=Comparative Anatomy and Morphology of the Hepaticae |title=New Manual of Bryology |location=Nichinan, Miyazaki, Japan |publisher=The Hattori botanical Laboratory |volume=2 |page=891}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome,&lt;ref name="Schuster 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crum &amp; Anderson"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Crum HA, Anderson LE |year=1980 |title=Mosses of Eastern North America |volume=1 |page=196 |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-04516-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to chemical signalling from females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Briggs DA |year=1965 |title=Experimental taxonomy of some British species of genus ''Dicranum'' |journal=New Phytologist |volume=64 |pages=366–386 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1965.tb07546.x |issue=3|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, males often have a more [[Animal coloration|colourful]] appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) that would seem to put them at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators). One proposed explanation for this is the [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Amotz Zahavi | vauthors = Zahavi A, Zahavi A |year=1997 |title=The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510035-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/handicapprincipl0000zeha }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis argues that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his [[Fitness (biology)|genetic fitness]] to females—traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be encumbered with such handicaps.

Through '''sexing''', [[biologist]]s and [[agricultural]] workers determine the [[sex]] of [[livestock]] and other animals they work with. The specialized trade of [[chicken sexing]] has a particular importance in the [[poultry]] industry.

The sex of [[mammal]]s can often be determined using [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Kunz, Thomas H., Chris Wemmer, and Virginia Hayssen. "[http://www.bu.edu/cecb/files/2009/08/sexagereproductive1996.pdf Sex, age, and reproductive condition of mammals]." Measuring and monitoring biological diversity: standard methods for mammals (DE Wilson, FR Cole, JD Nichols, R. Rudran, and MS Foster, eds.). Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, DC (1996): 279-290.&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted physical sexing is relevant in vertebrates with cloacae (e.g. [[birds]], [[reptiles]] or [[amphibians]]) when there is no external [[sexual dimorphism]]. In veterinary practice, [[Fiberscope|fibroscopy]] is used under [[general anaesthesia]] in birds such as [[parrots]].

'''Molecular sexing''' is a set of techniques that use [[DNA]] for determining sex in wild or domestic species&lt;ref&gt;Fernando, Prithiviraj, and Don J. Melnick.

Markers commonly used include [[amelogenin]], [[SRY]] and [[ZFX]]/[[ZFY]].

A '''shadow biosphere''' is a hypothetical [[microbe|microbial]] [[biosphere]] of Earth that would use radically different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] processes from that of currently known life. Although life on Earth is relatively well studied, if a shadow biosphere exists it may still remain unnoticed, because the exploration of the microbial world targets primarily the biochemistry of the macro-organisms.

==The hypothesis==
It has been proposed that the early Earth hosted multiple origins of life, some of which produced chemical variations on life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carol Cleland|Cleland, C.E.]] (2007) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053938 Epistemological issues in the study of microbial life: alternative biospheres].

Benner, Alonso Ricardo, and Matthew A. Carrigan, biochemists at the [[University of Florida]], argued that if [[RNA world hypothesis|organisms based on RNA]] once existed, they might still be alive today, unnoticed because they do not contain [[ribosome]]s, which are usually used to detect living microorganisms. They suggest searching for them in environments that are low in [[sulfur]], environments that are spatially constrained (for example, minerals with pores smaller than one [[micrometre]]), or environments that cycle between extreme hot and cold.&lt;ref&gt;Benner, S. A., Ricardo, A. and Carrigan, M. A. (2004) [http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf Is there a common chemical model for life in the universe?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214063212/http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }}. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 8, 672-689. {{doi|10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.10.003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed candidates for a shadow biosphere include organisms using different suites of amino acids in their proteins or different molecular units (e.g., bases or sugars) in their nucleic acids,&lt;ref name="Cleland and Copley 2005"&gt;[[Carol Cleland|Cleland, C.

==Criticism==
Methods used by proponents and conclusions drawn from experiments that purport to show evidence of shadow biospheres have been criticized. For example, evidence that once seemed to support arsenic as a substitute for phosphorus in DNA could have resulted from lab or field contamination, and DNA that includes arsenic is chemically unstable.&lt;ref name=vastag&gt;{{cite news|last=Vastag|first=Brian|title=Debate over arsenic-based life enters a new chapter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/debate-over-arsenic-based-life-enters-a-new-chapter/2011/05/26/AGhk7fCH_story.html?hpid=z9|newspaper=Washington Post|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sherman trap.JPG|thumb|A frontal shot of a Sherman trap.]]
The '''Sherman trap''' is a box-style [[Animal trapping|animal trap]] designed for the live capture of small [[mammals]]. It was invented by Dr. H. B. Sherman in the 1920s and became commercially available in 1955. Since that time, the Sherman trap has been used extensively by researchers in the biological sciences for capturing animals such as [[mice]], [[voles]], [[shrews]], and [[chipmunks]].  The Sherman trap consists of eight hinged pieces of [[sheet metal]] (either [[galvanized steel]] or [[aluminum]]) that allow the trap to be collapsed for storage or transport. Sherman traps are often set in grids and may be baited with grains and seed.

==Description==
The hinged design allows the trap to fold up flat into something only the width of one side panel.  This makes it compact for storage and easy to transport to field locations (e.g. in a back pack).  Both ends are hinged, but in normal operation the rear end is closed and the front folds inwards and latches the treadle, trigger plate, in place.  When an animal enters far enough to be clear of the front door, their weight releases the latch and the door closes behind them.

The lure or bait is placed at the far end and can be dropped in place through the rear hinged door.
[[File:Self folding aluminium animal trap.jpg|thumb|A modified design (Elliott), deployed in the field]]

===Variants===
Later, other variants that built upon the basic design, appeared - such as the ''Elliott'' trap used in Europe and Australasia.  The Elliott trap has simplified the design slightly and is made from just 7 hinged panels.

A '''shit flow diagram''' (also called '''excreta flow diagram''' or '''SFD''') is a [[High- and low-level|high level]] [[technical drawing]] used to display how [[Human waste|excreta]] moves through a location, and functions as a tool to identify where improvements are needed. The diagram has a particular focus on [[Sewage treatment|treatment of the waste]], and its final [[Sewage treatment#Disposal of treated sewage|disposal]] or [[Reuse of human excreta|use]]. SFDs are most often used in [[Developing country|developing countries]].

== Development ==
In 2012–2013, the [[World Bank]]'s [[Global Water Security &amp; Sanitation Partnership|Water and Sanitation Program]] sponsored a study on the [[fecal sludge management]] of twelve cities with the goal of developing tools for better understanding the flow of excreta through the cities. As a result, Isabel Blackett, Peter Hawkins, and Christiaan Heymans authored ''The missing link in sanitation service delivery: a review of fecal sludge management in 12 cities''.&lt;ref name="missinglink"&gt;{{Cite web|first1=Isabel|last1=Blackett|first2=Peter|last2=Hawkins|first3=Christiaan|last3=Heymans|date=April 1, 2014|url=https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/395181468323975012/The-missing-link-in-sanitation-service-delivery-a-review-of-fecal-sludge-management-in-12-cities|title=The missing link in sanitation service delivery : a review of fecal sludge management in 12 cities|website=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this as a basis, a group of excreta management institutions began collaborating in June 2014 to continue development of SFDs.&lt;ref name="sfdstory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sfd.susana.org/about/the-story-behind|title=The Story Behind the SFDs|website=sfd.susana.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SFD Promotion Initiative ===
In November 2014, the SFD Promotion Initiative was started with funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]. Initially funded as a one year project, it was extended in 2015. In September 2019, the focus of the program shifted to scaling up the current methods of producing SFDs to allow for citywide sanitation in [[South Asia]] and [[Africa]]. As of 2021 more than 140 shit flow diagram reports have been published. The initiative is managed as part of the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] and is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is partnered with many [[nonprofit organization]]s such as the [[Centre for Science and Environment]], [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology|EAWAG]], and the Global Water Security &amp; Sanitation Partnership.&lt;ref name="sfdstory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csesfd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cseindia.org/page/SFD-promotion-initiative|title=SFD Promotion Initiative|website=www.cseindia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eawagsfd"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/projects/ewm/sandec/|title=SFD – Shit Flow Diagrams – Eawag|website=www.eawag.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="susanasfd"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/shit-flow-diagrams-sfds-excreta-flow-diagrams|title=Shit flow diagrams (SFD) – Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)|first=Enno|last=Schroeder|website=www.susana.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in developing countries ==
The great majority of those living in [[urban area]]s, especially the [[Poverty|poor]], use non-sewer sanitation systems. This poses environmental and health challenges for growing urban areas in developing countries, and many of these countries will need to change their sanitation strategies as their population grows. Using a shit flow diagram allows political leaders and members of the community to see at a glance the challenges facing their sanitation systems, and where improvements will be most effective. The simplified nature of the diagram allows for easier dialog about local excreta management. Over 140 cities in the developing world have had SFDs prepared and published, many by nonprofit organizations. They are then used to identify where resources should be focused.&lt;ref name="frontiers"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Estimating Safely Managed Sanitation in Urban Areas; Lessons Learned From a Global Implementation of Excreta-Flow Diagrams|first1=Andy|last1=Peal|first2=Barbara|last2=Evans|first3=Sangaralingam|last3=Ahilan|first4=Radu|last4=Ban|first5=Isabel|last5=Blackett|first6=Peter|last6=Hawkins|first7=Lars|last7=Schoebitz|first8=Rebecca|last8=Scott|first9=Andy|last9=Sleigh|first10=Linda|last10=Strande|first11=Oscar|last11=Veses|date=January 31, 2020|journal=Frontiers in Environmental Science|volume=8|page=1|doi=10.3389/fenvs.2020.00001|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="susanasfd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="missinglink"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfdstory"/&gt;

'''Shridhar Chillal''' (born 29 January 1937) is an [[Indian people|Indian]] man from the city of Pune, who held the [[world record]] for the longest [[nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] ever reached on a single [[hand]], with a combined length of 909.6 centimeters (358.1 inches). Chillal's longest single nail is his thumbnail, measuring 197.8 centimeters (77.87 inches). He stopped cutting his nails in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swatman|first1=Rachel|title=Check out the longest fingernails ever in Shridhar Chillal's Record Holder Profile Video|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/9/record-holder-profile-video-shridhar-chillal-and-the-longest-fingernails-ever-398817|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=Guinness World Records|date=29 September 2015|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although proud of his record-breaking nails, Chillal has faced increasing difficulties due to the weight of his finger nails, including [[disfigurement]] of his fingers and loss of function in his left hand. He claims that [[Nerve injury|nerve damage]] to his left arm from the nails' immense weight has also caused [[Hearing loss|deafness]] in his left ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Record fingernails go under the hammer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/11/lukeharding|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=The Guardian|date=11 December 2000|location=New Delhi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chillal has appeared in films and television displaying his nails, such as ''[[Jackass 2.5]]''.

On 11 July 2018, Chillal had his fingernails cut with a power tool at the ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' museum in [[New York City]], where the nails will be put on display. A technician wearing protective gear cut the nails during a "nail clipping ceremony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mahdawi|first1=Arwa|title=Nails in the coffin: man with world's longest fingernails finally cuts them off|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/longest-fingernails-shridhar-chillal-cut-off|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=The Guardian|date=12 July 2018|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simband is an open developer platform consisting of a watch unit running Tizen and a wristband connector that holds a custom sensor module.

Simband is designed to be modular and allow for different sensor modules to be installed. Samsung provides a reference implementation of a sensor module called Simsense that supports multiple sensors, each generating a unique data stream. In November 2014 Samsung announced two custom modules developed by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Samsung adds partners to its mHealth platform|url=http://www.mhealthnews.com/blog/samsung-adds-partners-its-mhealth-platform|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Single-cell sequencing''' examines the [[Genome sequence|sequence]] information from individual [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s with optimized [[next generation sequencing|next-generation sequencing]] technologies, providing a higher resolution of cellular differences and a better understanding of the function of an individual cell in the context of its microenvironment.&lt;ref name=Eberwine&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eberwine J, Sul JY, Bartfai T, Kim J | title = The promise of single-cell sequencing | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–27 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24524134 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2769 | s2cid = 11575439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cancer, sequencing the DNA of individual cells can give information about mutations carried by small populations of cells.

== Background ==
A typical human cell consists of about 2 x 3.3 billion base pairs of DNA and 600 million mRNA bases. Usually, a mix of millions of cells is used in sequencing the DNA or RNA using traditional methods like [[Sanger sequencing]] or [[Illumina sequencing]]. By deep sequencing of DNA and RNA from a single cell, cellular functions can be investigated extensively.&lt;ref name="Eberwine" /&gt; Like typical next-generation sequencing experiments, single-cell sequencing protocols generally contain the following steps: isolation of a single cell, nucleic acid extraction and amplification, sequencing [[Library (biology)|library]] preparation, sequencing, and [[bioinformatic]] data analysis. It is more challenging to perform single-cell sequencing than sequencing from cells in bulk. The minimal amount of starting materials from a single cell makes degradation, sample loss, and contamination exert pronounced effects on the quality of sequencing data. In addition, due to the picogram level of the number of nucleic acids used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shintaku H, Nishikii H, Marshall LA, Kotera H, Santiago JG | title = On-chip separation and analysis of RNA and DNA from single cells | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 1953–1957 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24499009 | doi = 10.1021/ac4040218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; heavy amplification is often needed during sample preparation of single-cell sequencing, resulting in uneven coverage, noise, and inaccurate quantification of sequencing data.

Recent technical improvements make single-cell sequencing a promising tool for approaching a set of seemingly inaccessible problems. For example, heterogeneous samples, rare cell types, cell lineage relationships, [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]] of somatic tissues, analyses of microbes that cannot be cultured, and disease evolution can all be elucidated through single-cell sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nawy T | title = Single-cell sequencing | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 18 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24524131 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2771 | s2cid = 5252333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Single-cell sequencing was selected as the method of the year 2013 by Nature Publishing Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Method of the year 2013 | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24524124 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2801 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genome (DNA) sequencing  ==
Single-cell DNA genome sequencing involves isolating a single cell, amplifying the whole genome or region of interest, constructing sequencing libraries, and then applying next-generation DNA sequencing (for example [[Illumina dye sequencing|Illumina]], [[Ion semiconductor sequencing|Ion Torrent]], [[MGI dye sequencing|MGI]]). Single-cell DNA sequencing has been widely applied in mammalian systems to study normal physiology and disease. Single-cell resolution can uncover the roles of genetic mosaicism or intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in cancer development or treatment response.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gawad C, Koh W, Quake SR | title = Single-cell genome sequencing: current state of the science | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–188 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26806412 | doi = 10.1038/nrg.2015.16 | s2cid = 4800650 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of microbiomes, a genome from a single unicellular organism is referred to as a single amplified genome (SAG). Advancements in single-cell DNA sequencing have enabled collecting of genomic data from uncultivated prokaryotic species present in complex microbiomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alneberg J, Karlsson CM, Divne AM, Bergin C, Homa F, Lindh MV, Hugerth LW, Ettema TJ, Bertilsson S, Andersson AF, Pinhassi J | display-authors = 6 | title = Genomes from uncultivated prokaryotes: a comparison of metagenome-assembled and single-amplified genomes | journal = Microbiome | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 173 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30266101 | pmc = 6162917 | doi = 10.1186/s40168-018-0550-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although SAGs are characterized by low completeness and significant bias, recent computational advances have achieved the assembly of near-complete genomes from composite SAGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kogawa M, Hosokawa M, Nishikawa Y, Mori K, Takeyama H | title = Obtaining high-quality draft genomes from uncultured microbes by cleaning and co-assembly of single-cell amplified genomes | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 2059 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29391438 | pmc = 5794965 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-20384-3 | bibcode = 2018NatSR...8.2059K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data obtained from microorganisms might establish processes for culturing in the future.&lt;ref name=Lasken&gt;"{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasken RS | title = Single-cell genomic sequencing using Multiple Displacement Amplification | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 510–516 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17923430 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2007.08.005 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the genome assembly tools used in single cell single-cellencing include [[SPAdes]], IDBA-UD, Cortex, and HyDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taghavi Z, Movahedi NS, Draghici S, Chitsaz H | title = Distilled single-cell genome sequencing and de novo assembly for sparse microbial communities | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 29 | issue = 19 | pages = 2395–2401 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23918251 | pmc = 3777112 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt420 | arxiv = 1305.0062 | bibcode = 2013arXiv1305.0062T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
[[File:Single Cell Genome Sequencing Workflow.pdf|thumb|This figure illustrates the workflow of single-cell genome sequencing. MDA stands for Multiple Displacement Amplification.]]
A [[List of single cell omics methods|list of more than 100 different single-cell omics methods]] has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPe2ozb1Mny8sLvJaSE57RJr3oruiBoSudAVhSH-O8M/edit?usp=embed_facebook|title=Single-Cell-Omics.v2.3.13 @albertvilella|website=Google Docs|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multiple displacement amplification|Multiple displacement amplification (MDA)]] is a widely used technique, enabling amplifying [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#femtogram|femtograms]] of DNA from bacterium to [[microgram]]s for sequencing. Reagents required for MDA reactions include: random primers and DNA polymerase from bacteriophage phi29. In 30 degree isothermal reaction, DNA is amplified with included reagents. As the [[polymerases]] manufacture new strands, a strand displacement reaction takes place, synthesizing multiple copies from each template DNA. At the same time, the strands that were extended antecedently will be displaced. MDA products result in a length of about 12 kb and ranges up to around 100 kb, enabling its use in DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name="Lasken" /&gt; In 2017, a major improvement to this technique, called WGA-X, was introduced by taking advantage of a thermostable mutant of the phi29 polymerase, leading to better genome recovery from individual cells, in particular those with high G+C content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stepanauskas R, Fergusson EA, Brown J, Poulton NJ, Tupper B, Labonté JM, Becraft ED, Brown JM, Pachiadaki MG, Povilaitis T, Thompson BP, Mascena CJ, Bellows WK, Lubys A | display-authors = 6 | title = Improved genome recovery and integrated cell-size analyses of individual uncultured microbial cells and viral particles | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 84 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28729688 | pmc = 5519541 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-017-00128-z | bibcode = 2017NatCo...8...84S }}&lt;/ref&gt; MDA has also been implemented in a microfluidic droplet-based system to achieve a highly parallelized single-cell whole genome amplification. By encapsulating single-cells in droplets for DNA capture and amplification, this method offers reduced bias and enhanced throughput compared to conventional MDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hosokawa M, Nishikawa Y, Kogawa M, Takeyama H | title = Massively parallel whole genome amplification for single-cell sequencing using droplet microfluidics | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 5199 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28701744 | pmc = 5507899 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-05436-4 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...7.5199H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common method is [[MALBAC]].&lt;ref name="Genome-wide detection of single-nuc"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zong C, Lu S, Chapman AR, Xie XS | title = Genome-wide detection of single-nucleotide and copy-number variations of a single human cell | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6114 | pages = 1622–1626 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23258894 | pmc = 3600412 | doi = 10.1126/science.1229164 | bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1622Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; ThAs done in MDA, this method begins with isothermal amplificationbut the primers are flanked with a “common” sequence for downstream PCR amplification. As the preliminary amplicons are generated, the common sequence promotes self-ligation and the formation of “loops” to prevent further amplification. In contrast with MDA, the highly branched DNA network is not formed. Instead,, the loops are denatured in another temperature cycle allowing the fragments to be amplified with PCR. MALBAC has also been implemented in a microfluidic device, but the amplification performance was not significantly improved by encapsulation in nanoliter droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu Z, Lu S, Huang Y | title = Microfluidic whole genome amplification device for single cell sequencing | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 86 | issue = 19 | pages = 9386–9390 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25233049 | doi = 10.1021/ac5032176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing MDA and MALBAC, MDA results in better genome coverage, but MALBAC provides more even coverage across the genome. MDA could be more effective for identifying [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]], whereas MALBAC is preferred for detecting copy number variants. While performing MDA with a microfluidic device markedly reduces bias and contamination, the chemistry involved in MALBAC does not demonstrate the same potential for improved efficiency. 

A method particularly suitable for the discovery of genomic [[structural variation]] is [[Single-cell DNA template strand sequencing]] (a.k.a. Strand-seq).&lt;ref name=Falconer_2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falconer E, Hills M, Naumann U, Poon SS, Chavez EA, Sanders AD, Zhao Y, Hirst M, Lansdorp PM | display-authors = 6 | title = DNA template strand sequencing of single-cells maps genomic rearrangements at high resolution | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1107–1112 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23042453 | pmc = 3580294 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the principle of single-cell tri-channel processing, which uses joint modelling of read-orientation, read-depth, and haplotype-phase, Strand-seq enables discovery of the full spectrum of somatic [[structural variation]] classes ≥200kb in size. Strand-seq overcomes limitations of whole genome amplification based methods for identification of somatic genetic variation classes in single cells,&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;"{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanders AD, Meiers S, Ghareghani M, Porubsky D, Jeong H, van Vliet MA, Rausch T, Richter-Pechańska P, Kunz JB, Jenni S, Bolognini D, Longo GM, Raeder B, Kinanen V, Zimmermann J, Benes V, Schrappe M, Mardin BR, Kulozik AE, Bornhauser B, Bourquin JP, Marschall T, Korbel JO | display-authors = 6 | title = Single-cell analysis of structural variations and complex rearrangements with tri-channel processing | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 343–354 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 31873213 | doi = 10.1038/s41587-019-0366-x | pmc = 7612647 | s2cid = 209464011 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; because it is not susceptible against read chimers leading to calling artefacts (discussed in detail in the section below), and is less affected by drop outs. The choice of method depends on the goal of the sequencing because each method presents different advantages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
MDA of individual cell genomes results in highly uneven genome coverage, i.e. relative overrepresentation and underrepresentation of various regions of the template, leading to loss of some sequences. There are two components to this process: a) stochastic over- and under-amplification of random regions; and b) systematic bias against high %GC regions. The stochastic component may be addressed by pooling single-cell MDA reactions from the same cell type, by employing [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) and/or post-sequencing confirmation.&lt;ref name="Lasken" /&gt; The bias of MDA against high %GC regions can be addressed by using thermostable polymerases, such as in the process called WGA-X.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), which are a big part of genetic variation in the [[human genome]], and [[copy number variation]] (CNV), pose problems in single cell sequencing, as well as the limited amount of DNA extracted from a single cell. Due to scant amounts of DNA, accurate analysis of DNA poses problems even after amplification since coverage is low and is susceptible to errors. With MDA, average genome coverage is less than 80% and SNPs that are not covered by sequencing reads will be opted out. In addition, MDA shows a high ratio of [[allele]] dropout, not detecting alleles from heterozygous samples. Various SNP algorithms are currently in use but none are specific to single-cell sequencing. MDA with CNV also poses the problem of identifying false CNVs that conceal the real CNVs. To solve this, when patterns can be generated from false CNVs, algorithms can detect and eradicate this noise to produce true variants.&lt;ref name="Ning"&gt;"{{cite journal | vauthors = Ning L, Liu G, Li G, Hou Y, Tong Y, He J | title = Current challenges in the bioinformatics of single cell genomics | journal = Frontiers in Oncology | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 7 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24478987 | pmc = 3902584 | doi = 10.3389/fonc.2014.00007 | doi-access = free }}"&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Single-cell DNA template strand sequencing|Strand-seq]] overcomes limitations of methods based on whole genome amplification for genetic variant calling: Since Strand-seq does not require reads (or read pairs) transversing the boundaries (or breakpoints) of CNVs or copy-balanced structural variant classes, it is less susceptible to common artefacts of single-cell methods based on whole genome amplification, which include variant calling dropouts due to missing reads at the variant breakpoint and read chimera.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gawad C, Koh W, Quake SR | title = Single-cell genome sequencing: current state of the science | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–188 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26806412 | doi = 10.1038/nrg.2015.16 | s2cid = 4800650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders"/&gt;Strand-seq discovers the full spectrum of [[structural variation]] classes of at least 200kb in size, including [[breakage-fusion-bridge cycle|breakage-fusion-bridge cycles]] and [[chromothripsis]] events, as well as balanced inversions, and copy-number balanced or imbalanced translocations.&lt;ref name="Sanders"/&gt;" Structural variant calls made by Strand-seq are resolved by chromosome-length [[haplotype]], which provides additional variant calling specificity.&lt;ref name="Sanders"/&gt; As a current limitation, Strand-seq requires dividing cells for strand-specific labelling using [[bromodeoxyuridine]] (BrdU), and the method does not detect variants smaller than 200kb in size, such as [[Mobile genetic elements|mobile element insertions]].

=== Applications ===
[[Microbiome]]s are among the main targets of single cell genomics due to the difficulty of culturing the majority of microorganisms in most environments. Single-cell genomics is a powerful way to obtain microbial genome sequences without cultivation.

Single-cell DNA methylome sequencing quantifies [[DNA methylation]]. There are several known types of methylation that occur in nature, including [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] (5mC), [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine|5-hydroxymethylcytosine]] (5hmC), 6-methyladenine (6mA), and 4mC 4-methylcytosine (4mC). In eukaryotes, especially animals, 5mC is widespread along the genome and plays an important role in regulating gene expression by repressing [[transposable element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zemach A, McDaniel IE, Silva P, Zilberman D | title = Genome-wide evolutionary analysis of eukaryotic DNA methylation | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5980 | pages = 916–919 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20395474 | doi = 10.1126/science.1186366 | s2cid = 206525166 | bibcode = 2010Sci...328..916Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequencing 5mC in individual cells can reveal how epigenetic changes across genetically identical cells from a single tissue or population give rise to cells with different phenotypes.

=== Methods ===
[[Bisulfite sequencing]] has become the gold standard in detecting and sequencing 5mC in single cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crary-Dooley FK, Tam ME, Dunaway KW, Hertz-Picciotto I, Schmidt RJ, LaSalle JM | title = A comparison of existing global DNA methylation assays to low-coverage whole-genome bisulfite sequencing for epidemiological studies | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 206–214 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28055307 | pmc = 5406214 | doi = 10.1080/15592294.2016.1276680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of DNA with bisulfite converts cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. Therefore, DNA that has been treated with bisulfite retains only methylated cytosines. To obtain the methylome readout, the bisulfite-treated sequence is aligned to an unmodified genome. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was achieved in single cells in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smallwood SA, Lee HJ, Angermueller C, Krueger F, Saadeh H, Peat J, Andrews SR, Stegle O, Reik W, Kelsey G | display-authors = 6 | title = Single-cell genome-wide bisulfite sequencing for assessing epigenetic heterogeneity | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 817–820 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25042786 | pmc = 4117646 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method overcomes the loss of DNA associated with the typical procedure, where sequencing adapters are added prior to bisulfite fragmentation. Instead, the adapters are added after the DNA is treated and fragmented with bisulfite, allowing all fragments to be amplified by PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miura F, Enomoto Y, Dairiki R, Ito T | title = Amplification-free whole-genome bisulfite sequencing by post-bisulfite adaptor tagging | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 17 | pages = e136 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22649061 | pmc = 3458524 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using deep sequencing, this method captures ~40% of the total CpGs in each cell. With existing technology DNA cannot be amplified prior to bisulfite treatment, as the 5mC marks will not be copied by the polymerase.

Single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS) is another method.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo H, Zhu P, Wu X, Li X, Wen L, Tang F | title = Single-cell methylome landscapes of mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos analyzed using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing | journal = Genome Research | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 2126–2135 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24179143 | pmc = 3847781 | doi = 10.1101/gr.161679.113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method leverages the tendency of methylated cytosines to cluster at CpG islands (CGIs) to enrich for areas of the genome with a high CpG content. This reduces the cost of sequencing compared to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, but limits the coverage of this method. When [[Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing|RRBS]] is applied to bulk samples, the majority of the CpG sites in gene promoters are detected, but site in gene promoters only account for 10% of CpG sites in the entire genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu H, Smith ZD, Bock C, Boyle P, Gnirke A, Meissner A | title = Preparation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing libraries for genome-scale DNA methylation profiling | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 468–481 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21412275 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.190 | s2cid = 24912438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In single cells, 40% of the CpG sites from the bulk sample are detected. To increase coverage, this method can also be applied to a small pool of single cells. In a sample of 20 pooled single cells, 63% of the CpG sites from the bulk sample were detected. Pooling single cells is one strategy to increase methylome coverage, but at the cost of obscuring the heterogeneity in the population of cells.

=== Limitations ===
While bisulfite sequencing remains the most widely used approach for 5mC detection, the chemical treatment is harsh and fragments and degrades the DNA. This effect is exacerbated when moving from bulk samples to single cells. Other methods to detect DNA methylation include methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes also enable the detection of other types of methylation, such as 6mA with DpnI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu Y, Luo GZ, Chen K, Deng X, Yu M, Han D, Hao Z, Liu J, Lu X, Dore LC, Weng X, Ji Q, Mets L, He C | display-authors = 6 | title = N6-methyldeoxyadenosine marks active transcription start sites in Chlamydomonas | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 879–892 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25936837 | pmc = 4427561 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanopore sequencing|Nanopore-based sequencing]] also offers a route for direct methylation sequencing without fragmentation or modification to the original DNA. Nanopore sequencing has been used to sequence the methylomes of bacteria, which are dominated by 6mA and 4mC (as opposed to 5mC in eukaryotes), but this technique has not yet been scaled down to single cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beaulaurier J, Schadt EE, Fang G | title = Deciphering bacterial epigenomes using modern sequencing technologies | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Applications ===

=== Methods ===
[[File:RNA-Seq workflow-5.pdf|thumb|right|Single-cell RNA sequencing workflow]]
Current scRNA-seq protocols involve isolating single cells and their RNA, and then following the same steps as bulk RNA-seq: [[reverse transcription]] (RT), amplification, library generation and sequencing. Early methods separated individual cells into separate wells; more recent methods encapsulate individual cells in droplets in a microfluidic device, where the reverse transcription reaction takes place, converting RNAs to cDNAs. Each droplet carries a DNA "barcode" that uniquely labels the cDNAs derived from a single cell. Once reverse transcription is complete, the cDNAs from many cells can be mixed together for sequencing, because transcripts from a particular cell are identified by the unique barcode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein AM, Mazutis L, Akartuna I, Tallapragada N, Veres A, Li V, Peshkin L, Weitz DA, Kirschner MW | display-authors = 6 | title = Droplet barcoding for single-cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 5 | pages = 1187–1201 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26000487 | pmc = 4441768 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macosko EZ, Basu A, Satija R, Nemesh J, Shekhar K, Goldman M, Tirosh I, Bialas AR, Kamitaki N, Martersteck EM, Trombetta JJ, Weitz DA, Sanes JR, Shalek AK, Regev A, McCarroll SA | display-authors = 6 | title = Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 5 | pages = 1202–1214 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26000488 | pmc = 4481139 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges for scRNA-Seq include preserving the initial relative abundance of mRNA in a cell and identifying rare transcripts.&lt;ref name="Hebenstreit"&gt;"{{cite journal | vauthors = Hebenstreit D | title = Methods, Challenges and Potentials of Single Cell RNA-seq | journal = Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 658–667 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 24832513 | pmc = 4009822 | doi = 10.3390/biology1030658 | doi-access = free }}"&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse transcription step is critical as the efficiency of the RT reaction determines how much of the cell’s RNA population will be eventually analyzed by the sequencer. The [[processivity]] of reverse transcriptases and the priming strategies used may affect full-length cDNA production and the generation of libraries biased toward 3’ or 5' end of genes.

In the amplification step, either PCR or in vitro transcription (IVT) is currently used to amplify cDNA. One of the advantages of PCR-based methods is the ability to generate full-length cDNA. However, different PCR efficiency on particular sequences (for instance, GC content and snapback structure) may also be exponentially amplified, producing libraries with uneven coverage. On the other hand, while libraries generated by IVT can avoid PCR-induced sequence bias, specific sequences may be transcribed inefficiently, thus causing sequence drop-out or generating incomplete sequences.&lt;ref name="Eberwine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Most RNA-seq methods depend on [[Polyadenylation|poly(A) tail]] capture to enrich mRNA and deplete abundant and uninformative rRNA. Thus, they are often restricted to sequencing polyadenylated mRNA molecules. However, recent studies are now starting to appreciate the importance of non-poly(A) RNA, such as long-noncoding RNA and microRNAs in gene expression regulation. Small-seq is a single-cell method that captures small RNAs (&lt;300 nucleotides) such as microRNAs, fragments of tRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs in mammalian cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hagemann-Jensen M, Abdullayev I, Sandberg R, Faridani OR | title = Small-seq for single-cell small-RNA sequencing | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 2407–2424 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30250291 | doi = 10.1038/s41596-018-0049-y | s2cid = 52813142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method uses a combination of “oligonucleotide masks” (that inhibit the capture of highly abundant 5.8S rRNA molecules) and size selection to exclude large RNA species such as other highly abundant rRNA molecules. To target larger non-poly(A) RNAs, such as long non-coding mRNA, histone mRNA, circular RNA, and enhancer RNA, size selection is not applicable for depleting the highly abundant ribosomal RNA molecules (18S and 28s rRNA).&lt;ref name="Hayashi 619"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayashi T, Ozaki H, Sasagawa Y, Umeda M, Danno H, Nikaido I | title = Single-cell full-length total RNA sequencing uncovers dynamics of recursive splicing and enhancer RNAs | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 619 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29434199 | pmc = 5809388 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-02866-0 | bibcode = 2018NatCo...9..619H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-cell RamDA-Seq is a method that achieves this by performing reverse transcription with random priming (random displacement amplification) in the presence of “not so random” (NSR) primers specifically designed to avoid priming on rRNA molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armour CD, Castle JC, Chen R, Babak T, Loerch P, Jackson S, Shah JK, Dey J, Rohl CA, Johnson JM, Raymond CK | display-authors = 6 | title = Digital transcriptome profiling using selective hexamer priming for cDNA synthesis | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 647–649 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19668204 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1360 | s2cid = 12164981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this method successfully captures full-length total RNA transcripts for sequencing and detected a variety of non-poly(A) RNAs with high sensitivity, it has some limitations. The NSR primers were carefully designed according to rRNA sequences in the specific organism (mouse), and designing new primer sets for other species would take considerable effort. Recently, a CRISPR-based method named scDASH (single-cell depletion of abundant sequences by hybridization) demonstrated another approach to depleting rRNA sequences from single-cell total RNA-seq libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loi DS, Yu L, Wu AR | title = Effective ribosomal RNA depletion for single-cell total RNA-seq by scDASH | journal = PeerJ | volume = 9 | pages = e10717 | date = 2021-01-15 | pmid = 33520469 | pmc = 7812930 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.10717 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bacteria and other prokaryotes are currently not amenable to single-cell RNA-seq due to the lack of polyadenylated mRNA. Thus, the development of single-cell RNA-seq methods that do not depend on poly(A) tail capture will also be instrumental in enabling single-cell resolution microbiome studies. Bulk bacterial studies typically apply general rRNA depletion to overcome the lack of polyadenylated mRNA on bacteria, but at the single-cell level, the total RNA found in one cell is too small.&lt;ref name="Hayashi 619"/&gt; Lack of polyadenylated mRNA and scarcity of total RNA found in single bacteria cells are two important barriers limiting the deployment of scRNA-seq in bacteria.

These results suggest that regulation varies among members of a population to increase the chances of survival for a fraction of the population.

The first single-cell transcriptome analysis in a prokaryotic species was accomplished using the terminator exonuclease enzyme to selectively degrade rRNA and [[Rolling circle replication|rolling circle amplification]] (RCA) of mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kang Y, Norris MH, Zarzycki-Siek J, Nierman WC, Donachie SP, Hoang TT | title = Transcript amplification from single bacterium for transcriptome analysis | journal = Genome Research | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 925–935 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21536723 | pmc = 3106325 | doi = 10.1101/gr.116103.110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, the ends of single-stranded DNA were ligated together to form a circle, and the resulting loop was then used as a template for linear RNA amplification. The final product library was then analyzed by microarray, with low bias and good coverage. However, RCA has not been tested with RNA-seq, which typically employs next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-seq for bacteria would be highly useful for studying microbiomes. It would address issues encountered in conventional bulk metatranscriptomics approaches, such as failing to capture species present in low abundance, and failing to resolve heterogeneity among cell populations.

== Considerations ==

=== Isolation of single cells ===
There are several ways to isolate individual cells prior to whole genome amplification and sequencing.  [[Fluorescence-activated cell sorting]] (FACS) is a widely used approach. Individual cells can also be collected by micromanipulation, for example by serial dilution or by using a patch pipette or nanotube to harvest a single cell.&lt;ref name="Genome-wide detection of single-nuc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurimoto K, Yabuta Y, Ohinata Y, Saitou M | title = Global single-cell cDNA amplification to provide a template for representative high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 739–752 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17406636 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.79 | s2cid = 7404545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The advantages of micromanipulation are ease and low cost, but they are laborious and susceptible to misidentification of cell types under microscope. [[Laser-capture microdissection]] (LCM) can also be used for collecting single cells. Although LCM preserves the knowledge of the spatial location of a sampled cell within a tissue, it is hard to capture a whole single cell without also collecting the materials from neighboring cells.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;"{{cite journal | vauthors = Shapiro E, Biezuner T, Linnarsson S | title = Single-cell sequencing-based technologies will revolutionize whole-organism science | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 618–630 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23897237 | doi = 10.1038/nrg3542 | s2cid = 500845 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yachida S, Jones S, Bozic I, Antal T, Leary R, Fu B, Kamiyama M, Hruban RH, Eshleman JR, Nowak MA, Velculescu VE, Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B, Iacobuzio-Donahue CA | display-authors = 6 | title = Distant metastasis occurs late during the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer | journal = Nature | volume = 467 | issue = 7319 | pages = 1114–1117 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20981102 | pmc = 3148940 | doi = 10.1038/nature09515 | bibcode = 2010Natur.467.1114Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frumkin D, Wasserstrom A, Itzkovitz S, Harmelin A, Rechavi G, Shapiro E | title = Amplification of multiple genomic loci from single cells isolated by laser micro-dissection of tissues | journal = BMC Biotechnology | volume = 8 | issue = 17 | pages = 17 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18284708 | pmc = 2266725 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-8-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
High-throughput methods for single cell isolation also include [[microfluidics]]. Both FACS and microfluidics are accurate, automatic and capable of isolating unbiased samples. However, both methods require detaching cells from their microenvironments first, thereby causing perturbation to the transcriptional profiles in RNA expression analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalerba P, Kalisky T, Sahoo D, Rajendran PS, Rothenberg ME, Leyrat AA, Sim S, Okamoto J, Johnston DM, Qian D, Zabala M, Bueno J, Neff NF, Wang J, Shelton AA, Visser B, Hisamori S, Shimono Y, van de Wetering M, Clevers H, Clarke MF, Quake SR | display-authors = 6 | title = Single-cell dissection of transcriptional heterogeneity in human colon tumors | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1120–1127 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22081019 | pmc = 3237928 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White AK, VanInsberghe M, Petriv OI, Hamidi M, Sikorski D, Marra MA, Piret J, Aparicio S, Hansen CL | display-authors = 6 | title = High-throughput microfluidic single-cell RT-qPCR | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 34 | pages = 13999–14004 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21808033 | pmc = 3161570 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1019446108 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10813999W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of cells to be analyzed ===

==== scRNA-Seq ====
Generally speaking, for a typical bulk cell [[RNA-Seq|RNA-sequencing]] (RNA-seq) experiment, ten million reads are generated and a gene with higher than the threshold of 50 reads per kb per million reads (RPKM) is considered expressed. For a gene that is 1kb long, this corresponds to 500 reads and a minimum [[coefficient of variation]] (CV) of 4% under the assumption of the [[Poisson distribution]]. For a typical mammalian cell containing 200,000 mRNA, sequencing data from at least 50 single cells need to be pooled in order to achieve this minimum CV value. However, due to the efficiency of reverse transcription and other noise introduced in the experiments, more cells are required for accurate expression analyses and cell-type identification.&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt;

'''Single molecule fluorescent sequencing''' is one method of [[DNA]] sequencing. The core principle is the imaging of individual [[fluorophore]] molecules, each corresponding to one base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The properties and applications of single-molecule DNA sequencing|journal=Genome Biol. |date=2011|volume=12|issue=2|page=217|doi=10.1186/gb-2011-12-2-217|first1=John F |last1=Thompson|first2=Patrice M |last2=Milos |pmc=3188791 |pmid=21349208}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working on single molecule level, [[PCR|amplification]] of DNA is not required, avoiding amplification bias. The method lends itself to parallelization by probing many sequences simultaneously, imaging all of them at the same time. 

The principle can be applied stepwise (e.g. the [[Helicos single molecule fluorescent sequencing|Helicos]] implementation), or in real time (as in the [[Single molecule real time sequencing|Pacific Biosciences]] implementation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequencing a Single Molecule of DNA|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410333/sequencing-a-single-molecule-of-dna/|first1=Emily|last1=Singer|publisher=MIT Technology Review|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1781, processes for preparing highly concentrated forms of yeast were established. Research on Single Cell Protein Technology started a century ago when [[Max Delbrück]] and his colleagues found out the high value of surplus brewer’s yeast as a feeding supplement for animals.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied mycology and biotechnology. Volume 2: agriculture and food production|author1=Ugalde, U. O. |author2=Castrillo, J. I. |year = 2002|isbn = 978-0-444-51030-3|pages = 123–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I and World War II, yeast-SCP was employed on a large scale in Germany to counteract food shortages during the war. Inventions for SCP production often represented milestones for biotechnology in general: for example, in 1919, Sak in Denmark and Hayduck in Germany invented a method named, “Zulaufverfahren”, ([[Fed-batch culture|fed-batch]]) in which sugar solution was fed continuously to an aerated suspension of yeast instead of adding yeast to diluted sugar solution once ([[Batch reactor|batch]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In post war period, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) emphasized on hunger and malnutrition problems of the world in 1960 and introduced the concept of protein gap, showing that 25% of the world population had a deficiency of protein intake in their diet.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was also feared that agricultural production would fail to meet the increasing demands of food by humanity. By the mid 60’s, almost quarter of a million tons of food yeast were being produced in different parts of the world and Soviet Union alone produced some 900,000 tons by 1970 of food and fodder yeast.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the 1960s, researchers at [[British Petroleum]] developed what they called "proteins-from-oil process": a technology for producing single-cell protein by yeast fed by waxy n-paraffins, a byproduct of oil refineries. Initial research work was done by [[Alfred Champagnat]] at BP's Lavera Oil Refinery in France; a small pilot plant there started operations in March 1963, and the same construction of the second pilot plant, at [[Grangemouth Refinery|Grangemouth Oil Refinery]] in Britain, was authorized.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had eight plants of this kind by 1989. However, due to concerns of toxicity of alkanes in SCP and pressured by the environmentalist movements, the government decided to close them down, or convert to some other microbiological processes.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

[[Quorn]] is a range of vegetarian and vegan [[Meat analogue|meat-substitutes]] made from ''[[Fusarium venenatum]]'' [[mycoprotein]], sold in Europe and North America.

Another type of single cell protein-based meat analogue (which does not use fungi however but rather bacteria&lt;ref&gt;EOS, april 2019, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[Calysta]]. Other producers are Unibio (Denmark) Circe Biotechnologie (Austria) and String Bio (India).

==Production process==
Single-cell proteins develop when [[microbes]] ferment waste materials (including wood, straw, cannery, and food-processing wastes, residues from alcohol production, hydrocarbons, or human and animal excreta).&lt;ref name=Rhod&gt;
{{cite journal|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|volume=19|issue=3|author=S. Vrati|pages=199–202|year=1983|title=Single cell protein production by photosynthetic bacteria grown on the clarified effluents of biogas plant|doi=10.1007/BF00256454|s2cid=36659986}}
&lt;/ref&gt; With 'electric food' processes the inputs are electricity, {{CO2}} and trace minerals and chemicals such as fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/29/plan-to-sell-50m-meals-electricity-water-air-solar-foods |title=Plan to sell 50m meals made from electricity, water and air |first=Daniel |last=Boffey |date=29 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with extracting single-cell proteins from the wastes is the dilution and cost. They are found in very low concentrations, usually less than 5%. Engineers have developed ways to increase the concentrations including centrifugation, flotation, precipitation, coagulation, and filtration, or the use of semi-permeable membranes.

The single-cell protein must be dehydrated to approximately 10% moisture content and/or acidified to aid in storage and prevent spoilage. The methods to increase the concentrations to adequate levels and the de-watering process require equipment that is expensive and not always suitable for small-scale operations. It is economically prudent to feed the product locally and soon after it is produced.

==Properties==

Large-scale production of microbial biomass has many advantages over the traditional methods for producing proteins for food or feed.

# Microorganisms have a much higher growth rate (algae: 2–6 hours, yeast: 1–3 hours, bacteria: 0.5–2 hours). This also allows selection for strains with high yield and good nutritional composition more quickly and easily compared to breeding.
# Whereas large parts of crops, such as stems, leaves and roots, are not edible, single-cell microorganisms can be used entirely. Whereas parts of the edible fraction of crops are indigestible, many microorganisms are digestible at a much higher fraction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Microorganisms usually have a much higher protein content of 30–70% in the dry mass than vegetables or grains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  The amino acid profiles of many SCP microorganisms often have excellent nutritional quality, comparable to hen's eggs.
# Some microorganisms can build vitamins and nutrients which eukaryotic organisms such as plants cannot produce or not produce in significant amounts, including vitamin B12.
# Microorganisms can utilize a broad spectrum of raw materials as carbon sources including alkanes, methanol, methane, ethanol and sugars. What was considered "waste product" often can be reclaimed as nutrients and support growth of edible microorganisms.
# Like plants, autotrophic microorganisms are capable of growing on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Some of them, such as bacteria with the [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway]] or the [[Reverse Krebs cycle|reductive TCA]] can fix {{CO2}} with efficiencies ranging from 2-3 times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computation of metabolic fluxes and efficiencies for biological carbon dioxide fixation|journal = Metabolic Engineering|date = 2011-03-01|pages = 150–158|volume = 13|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.ymben.2011.01.005|pmid = 21276868|first1 = Nanette R.|last1 = Boyle|first2 = John A.|last2 = Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 10 times more efficiently than plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Design and analysis of synthetic carbon fixation pathways|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2010-05-11|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 2889323|pmid = 20410460|pages = 8889–8894|volume = 107|issue = 19|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0907176107|first1 = Arren|last1 = Bar-Even|first2 = Elad|last2 = Noor|first3 = Nathan E.|last3 = Lewis|first4 = Ron|last4 = Milo|bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.8889B|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; when also considering the effects of [[photoinhibition]].
# Some bacteria, such as several homoacetogenic clostridia, are capable of performing [[syngas fermentation]]. This means they can metabolize [[Syngas|synthesis gas]], a gas mixture of CO, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that can be made by gasification of residual intractable biowastes such as lignocellulose.
# Some bacteria are diazotrophic, i.e. they can fix N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air and are thus independent of chemical N-fertilizer, whose production, utilization and degradation causes tremendous harm to the environment, deteriorates public health, and fosters climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Nitrogen Cascade|journal = BioScience|date = 2003-04-01|issn = 0006-3568|pages = 341–356|volume = 53|issue = 4|doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0341:TNC]2.0.CO;2|first1 = James N.|last1 = Galloway|first2 = John D.|last2 = Aber|first3 = Jan Willem|last3 = Erisman|first4 = Sybil P.|last4 = Seitzinger|author-link4=Sybil P. Seitzinger|first5 = Robert W.|last5 = Howarth|first6 = Ellis B.|last6 = Cowling|first7 = B. Jack|last7 = Cosby| s2cid=3356400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Many bacteria can utilize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for energy supply, using enzymes called [[hydrogenase]]s. Whereas hydrogenases are normally highly O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensitive, some bacteria are capable of performing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent respiration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This feature allows autotrophic bacteria to grow on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without light at a fast growth rate. Since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be made efficiently by [[water electrolysis]], in a manner of speaking, those bacteria can be "powered by electricity".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# Microbial biomass production is independent of seasonal and climatic variations, and can easily be shielded from extreme weather events that are expected to cause crop failures with the ongoing [[Climate change|climate-change]]. Light-independent microorganisms such as yeasts can continue to grow at night.
# Cultivation of microorganisms generally has a much lower water footprint than agricultural food production. Whereas the global average blue-green water footprint (irrigation, surface, ground and rain water) of crops reaches about 1800 liters per kg crop&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; due to evaporation, transpiration, drainage and runoff, closed bioreactors producing SCP exhibits none of these causes.  
# Cultivation of microorganisms does not require fertile soil and therefore does not compete with agriculture. Thanks to the low water requirements, SCP cultivation can even be done in dry climates with infertile soil and may provide a means of fail-safe food supply in arid countries. 
# Photosynthetic microorganisms can reach a higher solar-energy-conversion efficiency than plants, because in photobioreactors supply of water, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a balanced light distribution can be tightly controlled.
# Unlike agricultural products which are processed towards a desired quality, it is easier with microorganisms to direct production towards a desired quality. Instead of extracting amino acids from soy beans and throwing away half of the plant body in the process, microorganisms can be genetically modified to overproduce or even secrete a particular amino acid. However, in order to keep a good consumer acceptance, it is usually easier to obtain similar results by screening for microorganisms which already have the desired trait or train them via selective adaptation.

Although SCP shows very attractive features as a nutrient for humans, however there are some problems that deter its adoption on global basis: 
* Fast growing microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast have a high concentration of  [[nucleic acid]], notably RNA. Levels must be limited in the diets of [[monogastric]] animals to &lt;50 g per day. Ingestion of [[purine]] compounds arising from [[RNA]] breakdown leads to increased [[Blood plasma|plasma]] levels of [[uric acid]], which can cause [[gout]] and [[kidney stones]]. Uric acid can be converted to [[allantoin]], which is excreted in urine. Nucleic acid removal is not necessary from animal feeds but is from human foods. A temperature hold at 64&amp;nbsp;°C inactivates fungal [[protease]]s . However, this problem can be remediated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}} One common method consists in a heat treatment which kills the cells, inactivates proteases and allows endogenous [[RNase]]s  to hydrolyse RNA with release of [[nucleotide]]s from cell to culture broth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Use of Yeast Biomass in Food Production|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xbZRt2pKwqUC|publisher = CRC Press|date = 1990-12-07|isbn = 9780849358661|first1 = Anna|last1 = Halasz|first2 = Radomir|last2 = Lasztity}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similar to plant cells, the cell wall of some microorganisms such as algae and yeast contains indigestible components, such as cellulose. The cells of some kind of SCP should be broken up in order to liberate the cell interior and allow complete digestion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}
* Some kind of SCP exhibits unpleasant color and flavors.
* Depending on the kind of SCP and the cultivation conditions, care must be taken to prevent and control contamination by other microorganisms because contaminants may produce toxins such as [[mycotoxins]] or cyanotoxins. An interesting approach to address this problem was proposed with the fungus ''Scytalidium acidophilum'' which grows at a pH as low as 1, outside the tolerance of most microorganisms. This allows it to grow on acid-hydrolysed paper waste at low-cost.&lt;ref name="Sacid" /&gt;
* Some yeast and fungal proteins are deficient in [[methionine]].

== Background ==

The development of high-throughput [[RNA sequencing]] (RNA-seq) and [[microarrays]] has made gene expression analysis a routine. RNA analysis was previously limited to tracing individual [[Transcription (biology)|transcripts]] by [[Northern blot]]s or [[quantitative PCR]]. Higher throughput and speed allow researchers to frequently characterize the expression profiles of populations of thousands of cells. The data from bulk [[assays]] has led to identifying genes differentially expressed in distinct cell populations, and [[biomarker]] discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Szabo |first=David T. |title=Biomarkers in Toxicology |publisher=Academic Press |year=2014 |isbn=9780124046306 |pages=1033–1038 |chapter=Chapter 62 - Transcriptomic biomarkers in safety and risk assessment of chemicals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies are limited as they provide measurements for whole tissues and, as a result, show an average expression profile for all the constituent cells. This has a couple of drawbacks. Firstly, different cell types within the same tissue can have distinct roles in multicellular organisms. They often form subpopulations with unique transcriptional profiles. Correlations in the gene expression of the subpopulations can often be missed due to the lack of subpopulation identification.&lt;ref name="Kanter 2015 53"/&gt; Secondly, bulk assays fail to recognize whether a change in the expression profile is due to a change in regulation or composition — for example if one cell type arises to dominate the population. Lastly, when your goal is to study cellular progression through [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], average expression profiles can only order cells by time rather than by developmental stage. Consequently, they cannot show trends in gene expression levels specific to certain stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Trapnell |first=Cole |date=October 2015 |title=Defining cell types and states with single-cell genomics |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26430159/ |journal=Genome Research |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1491–1498 |doi=10.1101/gr.190595.115 |issn=1549-5469 |pmc=4579334 |pmid=26430159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in biotechnology allow the measurement of gene expression in hundreds to thousands of individual cells simultaneously. While these breakthroughs in [[transcriptomics technologies]] have enabled the generation of single-cell transcriptomic data, they also presented new computational and analytical challenges. Bioinformaticians can use techniques from bulk RNA-seq for single-cell data. Still, many new computational approaches have had to be designed for this data type to facilitate a complete and detailed study of single-cell expression profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stegle |first=O. |last2=Teichmann |first2=S. |last3=Marioni |first3=J. |date=2015 |title=Computational and analytical challenges in single-cell transcriptomics |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computational-and-analytical-challenges-in-Stegle-Teichmann/aa85e1113a304c9e982778aec9b5b96a39d30431 |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |doi=10.1038/nrg3833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental steps ==

There is currently no standardized technique to generate single-cell data, all methods must include cell isolation from the population, [[lysate]] formation, amplification through [[reverse transcription]]  and quantification of expression levels. Common techniques for measuring expression are quantitative PCR or RNA-seq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kolodziejczyk |first1=Aleksandra A. |last2=Kim |first2=Jong Kyoung |last3=Svensson |first3=Valentine |last4=Marioni |first4=John C. |last5=Teichmann |first5=Sarah A. |title=The Technology and Biology of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing |journal=Molecular Cell |date=May 2015 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=610–620 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.005|pmid=26000846 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isolating single cells ===
 [[File:Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting (FACS) B2.jpg | 200px|thumb|Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting workflow (FACS)]]

There are several methods available to isolate and amplify cells for single-cell analysis. Low throughput techniques are able to isolate hundreds of cells, are slow, and enable selection. These methods include:
* [[Micropipetting]] 
* [http://www.single-cell-analysis.com/tag/cytoplasmic-aspiration/ Cytoplasmic aspiration] 
* [[Laser capture microdissection]].

High-throughput methods are able to quickly isolate hundreds to tens of thousands of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poulin|first1=Jean-Francois|last2=Tasic|first2=Bosiljka|last3=Hjerling-Leffler|first3=Jens|last4=Trimarchi|first4=Jeffrey M.|last5=Awatramani|first5=Rajeshwar|title=Disentangling neural cell diversity using single-cell transcriptomics|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=1 September 2016|volume=19|issue=9|pages=1131–1141|doi=10.1038/nn.4366|pmid=27571192|s2cid=14461377|language=en|issn=1097-6256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common techniques include:

=== Quantitative PCR (qPCR) ===
To measure the level of expression of each transcript qPCR can be applied. Gene specific [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] are used to amplify the corresponding gene as with regular [[PCR]] and as a result data is usually only obtained for sample sizes of less than 100 genes. The inclusion of [[housekeeping genes]], whose expression should be
constant under the conditions, is used for normalisation. The most commonly used house keeping genes include [[GAPDH]] and α-[[actin]], although the reliability of normalisation through this process is questionable as there is evidence that the level of expression can vary significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radonić|first1=Aleksandar|last2=Thulke|first2=Stefanie|last3=Mackay|first3=Ian M.|last4=Landt|first4=Olfert|last5=Siegert|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Nitsche|first6=Andreas|title=Guideline to reference gene selection for quantitative real-time PCR|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=23 January 2004|volume=313|issue=4|pages=856–862|pmid=14706621|issn=0006-291X|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.11.177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluorescent dyes]] are used as [[reporter gene|reporter molecules]] to detect the PCR product and monitor the progress of the amplification - the increase in fluorescence intensity is proportional to the [[amplicon]] concentration. A plot of fluorescence vs. cycle
number is made and a threshold fluorescence level is used to find cycle number at which the plot reaches this value. The cycle number at this point is known as the threshold cycle (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) and is measured for each gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wildsmith|first1=S. E.|last2=Archer|first2=G.

=== Single-cell RNA-seq ===
[[File:RNA Seq Experiment.png|thumb|RNA Seq Experiment]]
The [[Single cell sequencing|Single-cell]] [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]] technique converts a population of RNAs to a library of [[cDNA]] fragments. These fragments are sequenced by high-throughput [[next generation sequencing]] techniques and the reads are mapped back to the reference genome, providing a count of the number of reads associated with each gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Zhong|last2=Gerstein|first2=Mark|last3=Snyder|first3=Michael|title=RNA-Seq: a revolutionary tool for transcriptomics|journal=Nature Reviews. Genetics|date=23 March 2017|volume=10|issue=1|pages=57–63|doi=10.1038/nrg2484|pmid=19015660|pmc=2949280|issn=1471-0056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalisation of RNA-seq data accounts for cell to cell variation in the efficiencies of the cDNA library formation and sequencing. One method relies on the use of [[extrinsic]] RNA spike-ins (RNA sequences of known sequence and quantity) that are added in equal quantities to each cell [[lysate]] and used to normalise read count by the number of reads mapped to spike-in [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Lichun|last2=Schlesinger|first2=Felix|last3=Davis|first3=Carrie A.|last4=Zhang|first4=Yu|last5=Li|first5=Renhua|last6=Salit|first6=Marc|last7=Gingeras|first7=Thomas R.|last8=Oliver|first8=Brian|title=Synthetic spike-in standards for RNA-seq experiments|journal=Genome Research|date=23 March 2017|volume=21|issue=9|pages=1543–1551|doi=10.1101/gr.121095.111|pmid=21816910|pmc=3166838|issn=1088-9051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another control uses [[unique molecular identifiers]] (UMIs)-short DNA sequences (6–10nt) that are added to each cDNA before amplification and act as a bar code for each cDNA molecule. Normalisation is achieved by using the count number of unique UMIs associated with each gene to account for differences in amplification efficiency.&lt;ref name="Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq wi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=Saiful|last2=Zeisel|first2=Amit|last3=Joost|first3=Simon|last4=La Manno|first4=Gioele|last5=Zajac|first5=Pawel|last6=Kasper|first6=Maria|last7=Lönnerberg|first7=Peter|last8=Linnarsson|first8=Sten|title=Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq with unique molecular identifiers|journal=Nature Methods|date=1 February 2014|volume=11|issue=2|pages=163–166|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2772|pmid=24363023|s2cid=6765530|language=en|issn=1548-7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of both spike-ins, UMIs and other approaches have been combined for more accurate normalisation.

=== Considerations ===
A problem associated with single-cell data occurs in the form of zero inflated gene expression distributions, known as technical dropouts, that are common due to low mRNA concentrations of less-expressed genes that are not captured in the reverse transcription process. The percentage of mRNA molecules in the cell lysate that are detected is often only 10-20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kharchenko|first1=Peter V.|last2=Silberstein|first2=Lev|last3=Scadden|first3=David T.|title=Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis|journal=Nature Methods|date=1 July 2014|volume=11|issue=7|pages=740–742|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2967|pmid=24836921|language=en|issn=1548-7091|pmc=4112276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using RNA spike-ins for normalisation the assumption is made that the amplification and sequencing efficiencies for the [[endogenous]] and spike-in RNA are the same. Evidence suggests that this is not the case given fundamental differences in size and features, such as the lack of a [[polyadenylation|polyadenylated]] tail in spike-ins and therefore shorter length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svensson|first1=Valentine|last2=Natarajan|first2=Kedar Nath|last3=Ly|first3=Lam-Ha|last4=Miragaia|first4=Ricardo J.|last5=Labalette|first5=Charlotte|last6=Macaulay|first6=Iain C.|last7=Cvejic|first7=Ana|last8=Teichmann|first8=Sarah A.|title=Power analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments|journal=Nature Methods|date=6 March 2017|volume=advance online publication|issue=4|pages=381–387|doi=10.1038/nmeth.4220|pmid=28263961|pmc=5376499|language=en|issn=1548-7105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, normalisation using UMIs assumes the cDNA library is sequenced to saturation, which is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq wi"/&gt;

== Data analysis ==
Insights based on single-cell data analysis assume that the input is a matrix of normalised gene expression counts, generated by the approaches outlined above, and can provide opportunities that are not obtainable by bulk.

Three main insights provided:&lt;ref name="Computational and analytical challe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stegle |first1=Oliver |last2=Teichmann |first2=Sarah A. |last3=Marioni |first3=John C. |date=1 March 2015 |title=Computational and analytical challenges in single-cell transcriptomics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |language=en |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=133–145 |doi=10.1038/nrg3833 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=25628217 |s2cid=205486032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Identification and characterization of cell types and their spatial organisation in time
#Inference of [[gene regulatory networks]] and their strength across individual cells
#Classification of the [[stochastic]] component of transcription

The techniques outlined have been designed to help visualise and explore patterns in the data in order to facilitate the revelation of these three features.

=== Clustering ===

 [[File:KMeans-Gaussian-data.svg|thumb|K-Means-Gaussian-data]]
 [[File:Iris dendrogram.png|thumb|left|Iris dendrogram produced using a Hierarchical clustering algorithm]]

[[Subgroup analysis|Clustering]] allows for the formation of subgroups in the cell population. Cells can be clustered by their transcriptomic profile in order to analyse the sub-population structure and identify rare cell types or cell subtypes. Alternatively, genes can be clustered by their expression states in order to identify covarying genes. A combination of both clustering approaches, known as [[biclustering]], has been used to simultaneously cluster by genes and cells to find genes that behave similarly within cell clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buettner|first1=Florian|last2=Natarajan|first2=Kedar N.|last3=Casale|first3=F. Paolo|last4=Proserpio|first4=Valentina|last5=Scialdone|first5=Antonio|last6=Theis|first6=Fabian J.|last7=Teichmann|first7=Sarah A.|last8=Marioni|first8=John C.|last9=Stegle|first9=Oliver|title=Computational analysis of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-sequencing data reveals hidden subpopulations of cells|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=1 February 2015|volume=33|issue=2|pages=155–160|doi=10.1038/nbt.3102|pmid=25599176|language=en|issn=1087-0156|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clustering methods applied can be [[K-means clustering]], forming disjoint groups or [[Hierarchical clustering]], forming nested partitions.

==== Biclustering ====
Biclustering provides several advantages by improving the resolution of clustering. Genes that are only informative to a subset of cells and are hence only expressed there can be identified through biclustering. Moreover, similarly behaving genes that differentiate one cell cluster from another can be identified using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ntranos|first1=Vasilis|last2=Kamath|first2=Govinda M.|last3=Zhang|first3=Jesse M.|last4=Pachter|first4=Lior|last5=Tse|first5=David N.|title=Fast and accurate single-cell RNA-seq analysis by clustering of transcript-compatibility counts|journal=Genome Biology|date=26 May 2016|volume=17|issue=1|pages=112|doi=10.1186/s13059-016-0970-8|pmid=27230763|pmc=4881296|issn=1474-7596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensionality reduction===

[[File:PCA of Guinean and other African populations Y chromosome haplogroup frequencies.jpg|thumb|PCA example of Guinean and other African populations Y chromosome haplogroup frequencies]]

[[Dimensionality reduction]] algorithms such as [[Principal component analysis]] (PCA) and [[t-SNE]] can be used to simplify data for visualisation and pattern detection by transforming cells from a high to a lower [[dimensional space]]. The result of this method produces graphs with each cell as a point in a 2-D or 3-D space. Dimensionality reduction is frequently used before clustering as cells in high dimensions can wrongly appear to be close due to distance metrics behaving non-intuitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Emma|last2=Yau|first2=Christopher|title=ZIFA: Dimensionality reduction for zero-inflated single-cell gene expression analysis|journal=Genome Biology|date=1 January 2015|volume=16|pages=241|doi=10.1186/s13059-015-0805-z|pmid=26527291|pmc=4630968|issn=1474-760X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Principal component analysis====
The most frequently used technique is PCA, which identifies the directions of largest [[variance]] [[principal components]] and transforms the data so that the first principal component has the largest possible variance, and successive principle components in turn each have the highest variance possible while remaining orthogonal to the preceding components. The contribution each gene makes to each component is used to infer which genes are contributing the most to variance in the population and are involved in differentiating different subpopulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treutlein|first1=Barbara|last2=Brownfield|first2=Doug G.|last3=Wu|first3=Angela R.|last4=Neff|first4=Norma F.|last5=Mantalas|first5=Gary L.|last6=Espinoza|first6=F.

=== Differential expression ===

Detecting differences in gene expression level between two populations is used both single-cell and  bulk transcriptomic data. Specialised methods have been designed for single-cell data that considers single cell features such as technical dropouts and shape of the distribution e.g. [[Bimodal]] vs. [[unimodal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korthauer|first1=Keegan D.|last2=Chu|first2=Li-Fang|last3=Newton|first3=Michael A.|last4=Li|first4=Yuan|last5=Thomson|first5=James|last6=Stewart|first6=Ron|last7=Kendziorski|first7=Christina|author7-link= Christina Kendziorski |title=A statistical approach for identifying differential distributions in single-cell RNA-seq experiments|journal=Genome Biology|date=1 January 2016|volume=17|issue=1|pages=222|doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1077-y|pmid=27782827|pmc=5080738|issn=1474-760X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gene ontology enrichment ====
[[Gene ontology]] terms describe gene functions and the relationships between those functions into three classes:
#Molecular function
#Cellular component 
#Biological process

[[Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment]] is a technique used to identify which GO terms are over-represented or under-represented in a given set of genes. In single-cell analysis input list of genes of interest can be selected based on differentially expressed genes or groups of genes generated from biclustering. The number of genes annotated to a GO term in the input list is normalised against the number of genes annotated to a GO term in the background set of all genes in genome to determine statistical significance.&lt;ref name=hag1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haghverdi|first1=Laleh|last2=Büttner|first2=Maren|last3=Wolf|first3=F.

=== Pseudotemporal ordering ===
{{Main|Trajectory inference}}
[[File:7n graph with minimal spanning tree.svg|200px|thumb|Graph with minimal spanning tree]]

Pseudo-temporal ordering (or trajectory inference) is a technique that aims to infer gene expression dynamics from snapshot single-cell data. The method tries to order the cells in such a way that similar cells are closely positioned to each other. This trajectory of cells can be linear, but can also bifurcate or follow more complex graph structures. The trajectory, therefore, enables the inference of gene expression dynamics and the ordering of cells by their progression through differentiation or response to external stimuli.
The method relies on the assumptions that the cells follow the same path through the process of interest and that their transcriptional state correlates to their progression. The algorithm can be applied to both mixed populations and temporal samples.

More than 50 methods for pseudo-temporal ordering have been developed, and each has its own requirements for prior information (such as starting cells or time course data), detectable topologies, and methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1101/276907| pages = 276907|last1 = Saelens| first1 = Wouter| last2 = Cannoodt| first2 = Robrecht| last3 = Todorov| first3 = Helena| last4 = Saeys| first4 = Yvan| title = A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods: towards more accurate and robust tools| journal = bioRxiv| accessdate = 2018-03-12| date = 2018-03-05|url = https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/05/276907| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example algorithm is the Monocle algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trapnell|first1=Cole|last2=Cacchiarelli|first2=Davide|last3=Grimsby|first3=Jonna|last4=Pokharel|first4=Prapti|last5=Li|first5=Shuqiang|last6=Morse|first6=Michael|last7=Lennon|first7=Niall J.|last8=Livak|first8=Kenneth J.|last9=Mikkelsen|first9=Tarjei S.|last10=Rinn|first10=John L.|title=Pseudo-temporal ordering of individual cells reveals dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=23 March 2017|volume=32|issue=4|pages=381–386|doi=10.1038/nbt.2859|pmid=24658644|pmc=4122333|issn=1087-0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; that carries out dimensionality reduction of the data, builds a [[minimal spanning tree]] using the transformed data, orders cells in pseudo-time by following the longest connected path of the tree and consequently labels cells by type. Another example is the diffusion pseudotime (DPT) algorithm,&lt;ref name=hag1/&gt; which uses a diffusion map and diffusion process. Another class of methods such as MARGARET &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pandey|first1=Kushagra|last2=Zafar|first2=Hamim|date=2022|title=Inference of cell state transitions and cell fate plasticity from single-cell with MARGARET|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|doi=10.1093/nar/gkac412|pmid=35639499 |issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt; employ graph partitioning for capturing complex trajectory topologies such as disconnected and multifurcating trajectories.

===Network inference ===

Gene regulatory network inference is a technique that aims to construct a network, shown as a graph, in which the [[vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] represent the genes and edges indicate co-regulatory interactions. The method relies on the assumption that a strong statistical relationship between the expression of genes is an indication of a potential functional relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=X.|last3=Zou|first3=X.|last4=Tian|first4=T.|title=Inference of genetic regulatory network for stem cell using single cells expression data|journal=2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)|date=1 December 2016|pages=217–222|doi=10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822521|isbn=978-1-5090-1611-2|s2cid=27737735}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used method to measure the strength of a statistical relationship is [[correlation]]. However, correlation fails to identify [[non-linear]] relationships and [[mutual information]] is used as an alternative. Gene clusters linked in a network signify genes that undergo coordinated changes in expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moignard|first1=Victoria|last2=Macaulay|first2=Iain C.|last3=Swiers|first3=Gemma|last4=Buettner|first4=Florian|last5=Schütte|first5=Judith|last6=Calero-Nieto|first6=Fernando J.|last7=Kinston|first7=Sarah|last8=Joshi|first8=Anagha|last9=Hannah|first9=Rebecca|last10=Theis|first10=Fabian J.|last11=Jacobsen|first11=Sten Eirik|last12=de Bruijn|first12=Marella F.|last13=Göttgens|first13=Berthold|title=Characterization of transcriptional networks in blood stem and progenitor cells using high-throughput single-cell gene expression analysis|journal=Nature Cell Biology|date=1 April 2013|volume=15|issue=4|pages=363–372|doi=10.1038/ncb2709|pmid=23524953|language=en|issn=1465-7392|pmc=3796878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===

The presence or strength of technical effects and the types of cells observed often differ in single-cell transcriptomics datasets generated using different experimental protocols and under different conditions. This difference results in strong [[batch effects]] that may bias the findings of statistical methods applied across batches, particularly in the presence of [[confounding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=Stephanie C|last2=Townes|first2=William F|last3=Teng|first3=Mingxiang|last4=Irizarry|first4=Rafael A|title=Missing data and technical variability in single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments|journal=Biostatistics|date=6 November 2017|volume=19|issue=4|pages=562–578|doi=10.1093/biostatistics/kxx053|pmid=29121214|pmc=6215955|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of the aforementioned properties of single-cell transcriptomic data, batch correction methods developed for bulk sequencing data were observed to perform poorly. Consequently, researchers developed statistical methods to correct for batch effects that are robust to the properties of single-cell transcriptomic data to integrate data from different sources or experimental batches. Laleh Haghverdi performed foundational work in formulating the use of mutual nearest neighbors between each batch to define batch correction vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haghverdi|first1=Laleh|last2=Lun|first2=Aaron T L|last3=Morgan|first3=Michael D|last4=Marioni|first4=John C|title=Batch effects in single-cell RNA-sequencing data are corrected by matching mutual nearest neighbors|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2 April 2018|volume=36|issue=5|pages=421–427|doi=10.1038/nbt.4091|pmid=29608177|pmc=6152897|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these vectors, you can merge datasets that each include at least one shared cell type. An orthogonal approach involves the projection of each dataset onto a shared low-dimensional space using [[canonical correlation analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Andrew|last2=Hoffman|first2=Paul|last3=Smibert|first3=Peter|last4=Papalexi|first4=Efthymia|last5=Satija|first5=Rahul|title=Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2 April 2018|volume=36|issue=5|pages=421–427|doi=10.1038/nbt.4096|pmid=29608179|pmc=6700744|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual nearest neighbors and canonical correlation analysis have also been combined to define integration "anchors" comprising reference cells in one dataset, to which query cells in another dataset are normalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stuart|first1=Tim|last2=Butler|first2=Andrew|last3=Hoffman|first3=Paul|last4=Hafemeister|first4=Christoph|last5=Papalexia|first5=Efthymia|last6=Mauck|first6=William M III|last7=Hao|first7=Yuhan|last8=Marlon|first8=Stoeckius|last9=Smibert|first9=Peter|last10=Satija|first10=Rahul|title=Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data|journal=Cell|date=6 June 2019|volume=177|issue=7|pages=1888–1902|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031|pmid=31178118|pmc=6687398|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[genetics]], a '''single-nucleotide polymorphism''' ('''SNP''' {{IPAc-en|s|n|ɪ|p}}; plural '''SNPs''' {{IPAc-en|s|n|ɪ|p|s}}) is a [[germline]] substitution of a single [[nucleotide]] at a specific position in the [[genome]].

For example, at a specific base position in the human genome, the [[Guanine|G nucleotide]] may appear in most individuals, but in a minority of individuals, the position is occupied by an [[Adenine|A]].

== Types ==
[[File:Types of SNP new1.png|thumb|400 px|Types of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)]]

Single-nucleotide [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] may fall within coding sequences of [[gene]]s, [[Noncoding DNA|non-coding regions of genes]], or in the [[intergenic region]]s (regions between genes). SNPs within a coding sequence do not necessarily change the [[amino acid]] sequence of the [[protein]] that is produced, due to [[Genetic code#Degeneracy|degeneracy of the genetic code]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

SNPs in the coding region are of two types: synonymous SNPs and nonsynonymous SNPs. Synonymous SNPs do not affect the protein sequence, while nonsynonymous SNPs change the amino acid sequence of protein.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

* SNPs in [[coding region]]s:
** [[synonymous substitution]]s by definition do not result in a change of amino acid in the protein, but still can affect its function in other ways. An example would be a seemingly silent mutation in the multidrug resistance gene 1 ([[P-glycoprotein|MDR1]]), which codes for a cellular membrane pump that expels drugs from the cell, can slow down translation and allow the peptide chain to fold into an unusual conformation, causing the mutant pump to be less functional (in MDR1 protein e.g. C1236T polymorphism changes a GGC codon to GGT at amino acid position 412 of the polypeptide (both encode glycine) and the C3435T polymorphism changes ATC to ATT at position 1145 (both encode isoleucine)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kimchi-Sarfaty C, Oh JM, Kim IW, Sauna ZE, Calcagno AM, Ambudkar SV, Gottesman MM|date=January 2007|title=A "silent" polymorphism in the MDR1 gene changes substrate specificity|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230874|journal=Science|volume=315|issue=5811|pages=525–8|bibcode=2007Sci...315..525K|doi=10.1126/science.1135308|pmid=17185560|s2cid=15146955}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s:
*** [[Missense mutation|missense]] – single change in the base results in change in amino acid of protein and its malfunction which leads to disease (e.g. c.1580G&gt;T SNP in [[LMNA]] gene – position 1580 (nt) in the DNA sequence (CGT codon) causing the [[guanine]] to be replaced with the [[thymine]], yielding CTT codon in the DNA sequence, results at the protein level in the replacement of the [[arginine]] by the [[leucine]] in the position 527,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Al-Haggar M, Madej-Pilarczyk A, Kozlowski L, Bujnicki JM, Yahia S, Abdel-Hadi D, Shams A, Ahmad N, Hamed S, Puzianowska-Kuznicka M|date=November 2012|title=A novel homozygous p.Arg527Leu LMNA mutation in two unrelated Egyptian families causes overlapping mandibuloacral dysplasia and progeria syndrome|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1134–40|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2012.77|pmc=3476705|pmid=22549407}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[phenotype]] level this manifests in overlapping [[mandibuloacral dysplasia]] and [[progeria syndrome]])
*** [[Nonsense mutation|nonsense]] – [[point mutation]] in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature [[stop codon]], or a ''nonsense codon'' in the [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] [[mRNA]], and in a [[truncation|truncated]], incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein product (e.g. [[Cystic fibrosis]] caused by the G542X mutation in the [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] gene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cordovado SK, Hendrix M, Greene CN, Mochal S, Earley MC, Farrell PM, Kharrazi M, Hannon WH, Mueller PW|date=February 2012|title=CFTR mutation analysis and haplotype associations in CF patients|journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism|volume=105|issue=2|pages=249–54|doi=10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.10.013|pmc=3551260|pmid=22137130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNPs that are not in protein-coding regions may still affect [[gene splicing]], [[transcription factor]] binding, [[messenger RNA]] degradation, or the sequence of noncoding RNA. Gene expression affected by this type of SNP is referred to as an eSNP (expression SNP) and may be upstream or downstream from the gene.

== Frequency ==

More than 335 million SNPs have been found across humans from multiple populations.{{Citation needed|reason=The 1000 Genomes Project citation for the next sentence makes no mention of 335 million SNPs; it does assert that it has contributed 80 million of the 100 million SNPs catalogued by dbSNP (more precisely, it states that it has identified 84.7 million SNPs.) |date=August 2021}} A typical genome differs from the reference human genome at 4 to 5 million sites, most of which (more than 99.9%) consist of SNPs and short [[indel]]s.&lt;ref name="100genome"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Auton A, Brooks LD, Durbin RM, Garrison EP, Kang HM, Korbel JO, Marchini JL, McCarthy S, McVean GA, Abecasis GR | title = A global reference for human genetic variation | journal = Nature | volume = 526 | issue = 7571 | pages = 68–74 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432245 | pmc = 4750478 | doi = 10.1038/nature15393 | bibcode = 2015Natur.526...68T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Within a genome ===
The genomic distribution of SNPs is not homogenous; SNPs occur in [[Noncoding DNA|non-coding regions]] more frequently than in [[coding region]]s or, in general, where natural selection is acting and "fixing" the [[allele]] (eliminating other variants) of the SNP that constitutes the most favorable genetic adaptation.&lt;ref name="Barreiro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barreiro LB, Laval G, Quach H, Patin E, Quintana-Murci L | s2cid = 205357396 | title = Natural selection has driven population differentiation in modern humans | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 340–5 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18246066 | doi = 10.1038/ng.78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors, like [[genetic recombination]] and mutation rate, can also determine SNP density.&lt;ref name="Nachman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nachman MW | title = Single nucleotide polymorphisms and recombination rate in humans | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 481–5 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11525814 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(01)02409-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNP density can be predicted by the presence of [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]]: AT microsatellites in particular are potent predictors of SNP density, with long (AT)(n) repeat tracts tending to be found in regions of significantly reduced SNP density and low [[GC content]].&lt;ref name="Varela"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Varela MA, Amos W | title = Heterogeneous distribution of SNPs in the human genome: microsatellites as predictors of nucleotide diversity and divergence | journal = Genomics | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 151–9 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20026267 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2009.12.003 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Within a population ===
There are variations between human populations, so a SNP allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another.  However, this pattern of variation is relatively rare; in a global sample of 67.3 million SNPs, the [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] "found no such private variants that are [[fixed allele|fixed]] in a given continent or major region. The highest frequencies are reached by a few tens of variants present at &gt;70% (and a few thousands at &gt;50%) in Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. By contrast, the highest frequency variants private to Europe, East Asia, the Middle East, or Central and South Asia reach just 10 to 30%."&lt;ref name="pmid32193295"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bergström A, McCarthy SA, Hui R, Almarri MA, Ayub Q, Danecek P | display-authors=etal| title=Insights into human genetic variation and population history from 929 diverse genomes. | journal=Science | year= 2020 | volume= 367 | issue= 6484 | pages=  eaay5012| pmid=32193295 | doi=10.1126/science.aay5012 | pmc=7115999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a population, SNPs can be assigned a [[minor allele frequency]]—the lowest allele frequency at a [[locus (genetics)|locus]] that is observed in a particular population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu Z, Yuan D, Luo D, Lu X, Huang S | title = Enrichment of Minor Alleles of Common SNPs and Improved Risk Prediction for Parkinson's Disease | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = e0133421 | date = 2015-07-24 | pmid = 26207627 | pmc = 4514478 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0133421 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1033421Z | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simply the lesser of the two allele frequencies for single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

* [[Genetic association|Association studies]] can determine whether a genetic variant is associated with a disease or trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zhang K, Qin ZS, Liu JS, Chen T, Waterman MS, Sun F|date=May 2004|title=Haplotype block partitioning and tag SNP selection using genotype data and their applications to association studies|journal=Genome Research|volume=14|issue=5|pages=908–16|doi=10.1101/gr.1837404|pmc=479119|pmid=15078859}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A tag SNP is a representative single-nucleotide polymorphism in a region of the genome with high [[linkage disequilibrium]] (the non-random association of alleles at two or more loci). Tag SNPs are useful in whole-genome SNP association studies, in which hundreds of thousands of SNPs across the entire genome are genotyped.
* [[Haplotype]] mapping: sets of alleles or DNA sequences can be clustered so that a single SNP can identify many linked SNPs.
* [[Linkage disequilibrium]] (LD), a term used in population genetics, indicates non-random association of alleles at two or more loci, not necessarily on the same chromosome. It refers to the phenomenon that SNP allele or DNA sequence that are close together in the genome tend to be inherited together. LD can be affected by two parameters (among other factors, such as population stratification): 1) The distance between the SNPs [the larger the distance, the lower the LD]. 2) Recombination rate [the lower the recombination rate, the higher the LD].&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gupta PK, Roy JK, Prasad M|date=25 February 2001|title=Single nucleotide polymorphisms: a new paradigm for molecular marker technology and DNA polymorphism detection with emphasis on their use in plants|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229085137|url-status=live|journal=Current Science|volume=80|issue=4|pages=524–535|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213091838/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229085137_Single_nucleotide_polymorphisms_a_new_paradigm_for_molecular_marker_technology_and_DNA_polymorphism_detection_with_emphasis_on_their_use_in_plantsPK_Gupta_JK_Roy_M_PrasadCurr_Sci_80_4_524-35|archive-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of main contributions of SNPs in clinical research is genome-wide association study (GWAS).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Visscher|first1=Peter M.|last2=Wray|first2=Naomi R.|last3=Zhang|first3=Qian|last4=Sklar|first4=Pamela|last5=McCarthy|first5=Mark I.|last6=Brown|first6=Matthew A.|last7=Yang|first7=Jian|date=July 2017|title=10 Years of GWAS Discovery: Biology, Function, and Translation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=101|issue=1|pages=5–22|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005|pmid=28686856|pmc=5501872|issn=0002-9297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genome-wide genetic data can be generated by multiple technologies, including SNP array and whole genome sequencing. GWAS has been commonly used in identifying SNPs associated with diseases or clinical phenotypes or traits. Since GWAS is a genome-wide assessment, a large sample site is required to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect all possible associations. Some SNPs have relatively small effect on diseases or clinical phenotypes or traits. To estimate study power, the genetic model for disease needs to be considered, such as dominant, recessive, or additive effects. Due to genetic heterogeneity, GWAS analysis must be adjusted for race.

Candidate gene association study

Candidate gene association study is commonly used in genetic study before the invention of high throughput genotyping or sequencing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dong|first1=Linda M.|last2=Potter|first2=John D.|last3=White|first3=Emily|last4=Ulrich|first4=Cornelia M.|last5=Cardon|first5=Lon R.|last6=Peters|first6=Ulrike|date=2008-05-28|title=Genetic Susceptibility to Cancer|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.299.20.2423|journal=JAMA|volume=299|issue=20|pages=2423–2436|doi=10.1001/jama.299.20.2423|pmid=18505952|pmc=2772197|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidate gene association study is to investigate limited number of pre-specified SNPs for association with diseases or clinical phenotypes or traits. So this is a hypothesis driven approach. Since only a limited number of SNPs are tested, a relatively small sample size is sufficient to detect the association. Candidate gene association approach is also commonly used to confirm findings from GWAS in independent samples.

Homozygosity mapping in disease

Genome-wide SNP data can be used for homozygosity mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alkuraya|first=Fowzan S.|date=April 2010|title=Homozygosity mapping: One more tool in the clinical geneticist's toolbox|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/gim.0b013e3181ceb95d|journal=Genetics in Medicine|volume=12|issue=4|pages=236–239|doi=10.1097/gim.0b013e3181ceb95d|pmid=20134328|s2cid=10789932|issn=1098-3600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homozygosity mapping is a method used to identify homozygous autosomal recessive loci, which can be a powerful tool to map genomic regions or genes that are involved in disease pathogenesis.

=== Forensics ===

SNPs have historically been used to match a forensic DNA sample to a suspect but has been made obsolete due to advancing [[Microsatellite|STR]]-based [[DNA Fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]] techniques. However, the development of [[Next-Generation Sequencing|next-generation-sequencing]] (NGS) technology may allow for more opportunities for the use of SNPs in phenotypic clues such as ethnicity, hair color, and eye color with a good probability of a match. This can additionally be applied to increase the accuracy of facial reconstructions by providing information that may otherwise be unknown, and this information can be used to help identify suspects even without a STR [[DNA profiling|DNA profile]] match.

Some cons to using SNPs versus STRs is that SNPs yield less information than STRs, and therefore more SNPs are needed for analysis before a profile of a suspect is able to be created. Additionally, SNPs heavily rely on the presence of a database for comparative analysis of samples. However, in instances with degraded or small volume samples, SNP techniques are an excellent alternative to STR methods. SNPs (as opposed to STRs) have an abundance of potential markers, can be fully automated, and a possible reduction of required fragment length to less than 100bp.[26]

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
Pharmacogenetics focuses on identifying genetic variations including SNPs associated with differential responses to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Ann K|date=2017-10-11|title=Pharmacogenetics: a general review on progress to date|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldx035|journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=124|issue=1|pages=65–79|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldx035|pmid=29040422|issn=0007-1420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many drug metabolizing enzymes, drug targets, or target pathways can be influenced by SNPs. The SNPs involved in drug metabolizing enzyme activities can change drug pharmacokinetics, while the SNPs involved in drug target or its pathway can change drug pharmacodynamics. Therefore, SNPs are potential genetic markers that can be used to predict drug exposure or effectiveness of the treatment. Genome-wide pharmacogenetic study is called pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are important in the development of precision medicine, especially for life threatening diseases such as cancers.

=== Disease ===
Only small amount of SNPs in the human genome may have impact on human diseases. Large scale GWAS has been done for the most important human diseases, including heart diseases, metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Most of the SNPs with relatively large effects on these diseases have been identified. These findings have significantly improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and molecular pathways, and facilitated development of better treatment. Further GWAS with larger samples size will reveal the SNPs with relatively small effect on diseases. For common and complex diseases, such as type-2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer’s disease, multiple genetic factors are involved in disease etiology. In addition, gene-gene interaction and gene-environment interaction also play an important role in disease initiation and progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Musci|first1=Rashelle J.|last2=Augustinavicius|first2=Jura L.|last3=Volk|first3=Heather|date=2019-08-13|title=Gene-Environment Interactions in Psychiatry: Recent Evidence and Clinical Implications|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11920-019-1065-5|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=21|issue=9|page=81|doi=10.1007/s11920-019-1065-5|pmid=31410638|pmc=7340157|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
The nomenclature for SNPs include several variations for an individual SNP, while lacking a common consensus.

The rs### standard is that which has been adopted by [[dbSNP]] and uses the prefix "rs", for "reference SNP", followed by a unique and arbitrary number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = SNP FAQ Archive | location = Bethesda (MD) | publisher = U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44417/ | chapter = Clustered RefSNPs (rs) and Other Data Computed in House |date=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SNPs are frequently referred to by their dbSNP rs number, as in the examples above.

The Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) uses a standard which conveys more information about the SNP. Examples are:
* c.76A&amp;gt;T: "c." for [[coding region]], followed by a number for the position of the nucleotide, followed by a one-letter abbreviation for the nucleotide (A, C, G, T or U), followed by a greater than sign ("&gt;") to indicate substitution, followed by the abbreviation of the nucleotide which replaces the former&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/recs.html|title=Recommendations for the description of sequence variants|author=J.T.

== SNP analysis ==
SNPs can be easily assayed due to only containing two possible [[allele]]s and three possible [[genotype]]s involving the two alleles: [[Zygosity|homozygous]] A, homozygous B and [[Zygosity|heterozygous]] AB, leading to many possible techniques for analysis. Some include: [[DNA sequencing]]; [[capillary electrophoresis]]; [[mass spectrometry]]; [[single-strand conformation polymorphism]] (SSCP); [[Single-base extension|single base extension]]; electrochemical analysis; denaturating HPLC and [[gel electrophoresis]]; [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]]; and [[Hybridization assay|hybridization]] analysis.

== Programs for prediction of SNP effects ==
An important group of SNPs are those that corresponds to [[missense mutations]] causing amino acid change on protein level. [[Point mutation]] of particular residue can have different effect on protein function (from no effect to complete disruption its function). Usually, change in amino acids with similar size and physico-chemical properties (e.g. substitution from leucine to valine) has mild effect, and opposite. Similarly, if SNP disrupts [[secondary structure]] elements (e.g. substitution to proline in [[alpha helix]] region) such mutation usually may affect whole protein structure and function. Using those simple and many other [[machine learning]] derived rules a group of programs for the prediction of SNP effect was developed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Andrew D.|date=October 2009|title=SNP bioinformatics: a comprehensive review of resources|journal=Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics|volume=2|issue=5|pages=530–536|doi=10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.109.872010|issn=1942-325X|pmc=2789466|pmid=20031630}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://sift-dna.org SIFT] This program provides insight into how a laboratory induced missense or nonsynonymous mutation will affect protein function based on physical properties of the amino acid and sequence homology.

'''A single-pass membrane protein''' also known as '''single-spanning protein''' or '''bitopic protein''' is a [[transmembrane protein]] that spans the [[lipid bilayer]] only once.&lt;ref name="UniProt"&gt;{{cite web |title=Single-pass membrane protein |url=https://www.uniprot.org/locations/SL-9904 |website=www.uniprot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Membrane Structural Biology: With Biochemical and Biophysical Foundations'', by Mary Luckey, 2014, [[Cambridge University Press]], page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins may constitute up to 50% of all [[transmembrane proteins]], depending on the organism, and contribute significantly to [[Interactome|the network of interactions between different proteins in cells]], including interactions via transmembrane [[alpha helix|alpha helices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How important are transmembrane helices of bitopic membrane proteins?|first1=Moti|last1=Zviling|first2=Uzi|last2=Kochva|first3=Isaiah T.|last3=Arkin|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes|year=2007|volume=1768|issue=3|pages=387–392|doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.11.019|pmid=17258687|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually include one or several water-soluble [[Protein domain|domains]] situated at the different sides of [[biological membrane]]s, for example in single-pass [[transmembrane receptors]]. Some of them are small and serve as regulatory or structure-stabilizing subunits in large multi-protein transmembrane complexes, such as [[photosystems]] or the [[respiratory chain]]. A 2013 estimate identified about 1300 single-pass membrane proteins in the [[human genome]].&lt;ref name="pahl_2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pahl |first1=Matthew C |last2=Askinazi |first2=Olga L |last3=Hamilton |first3=Catherine |last4=Cheng |first4=Irene |last5=Cichewicz |first5=Karol |last6=Kuhn |first6=Jason |last7=Manohar |first7=Sumanth |last8=Deppmann |first8=Christopher D |title=Signalling via Single-Pass Transmembrane Proteins |journal=eLS |date=2013-10-18 |pages=a0025160 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0025160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topology-based classification==
Bitopic proteins are classified into 4 types, depending on their [[transmembrane topology]] and location of the transmembrane helix in the amino acid sequence of the protein. According to [[Uniprot]]:
* ''Type I:'' [[N-terminus]] on the extracellular side of the membrane; removed [[signal peptide]]&lt;ref name="uniprot1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Single-pass type I membrane protein |url=https://www.uniprot.org/locations/SL-9905 |website=UniProt |access-date=15 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Type II:'' N-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane; transmembrane helix located close to the N-terminus, where it works as an anchor&lt;ref name="uniprot2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Single-pass type II membrane protein |url=https://www.uniprot.org/locations/SL-9906 |website=UniProt |access-date=15 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Type III:'' N-terminus on the extracellular side of the membrane; no [[signal peptide]]&lt;ref name="uniprot3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Single-pass type III membrane protein |url=https://www.uniprot.org/locations/SL-9907 |website=UniProt |access-date=15 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Type IV:''  N-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane; transmembrane helix located close to the C-terminus, where it works as an anchor&lt;ref name="uniprot4"&gt;{{cite web |title=Single-pass type IV membrane protein |url=https://www.uniprot.org/locations/SL-9908 |website=UniProt |access-date=15 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence type I proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains [[Protein targeting|targeted]] to the ER lumen during synthesis. Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being targeted to the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen.

==Structure==
A single-pass transmembrane protein typically consists of three domains, the [[extracellular domain]], the [[transmembrane domain]], and the [[intracellular domain]]. The transmembrane domain is the smallest at around 25 [[amino acid residue]]s and forms an [[alpha helix]] inserted into the membrane bilayer. The ECD is typically much larger than the ICD and is often [[globular protein|globular]], whereas many ICDs have relatively high [[intrinsically disordered protein|disorder]].&lt;ref name="bugge_2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bugge |first1=Katrine |last2=Lindorff‐Larsen |first2=Kresten |last3=Kragelund |first3=Birthe B. |title=Understanding single‐pass transmembrane receptor signaling from a structural viewpoint—what are we missing? |journal=The FEBS Journal |date=December 2016 |volume=283 |issue=24 |pages=4424–4451 |doi=10.1111/febs.13793|url=https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/173591228/Bugge_2016_Understanding_single_pass.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proteins in this class function as monomers, but dimerization or higher-order oligomerization is common.&lt;ref name=bugge_2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name="valley_2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valley |first1=Christopher C. |last2=Lewis |first2=Andrew K. |last3=Sachs |first3=Jonathan N. |title=Piecing it together: Unraveling the elusive structure-function relationship in single-pass membrane receptors |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes |date=September 2017 |volume=1859 |issue=9 |pages=1398–1416 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.01.016|pmc=5487282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The number of single-pass transmembrane proteins in an organism's [[genome]] varies significantly. It is higher in [[eukaryote]]s than [[prokaryotes]] and in [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] than [[unicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref name="pogozheva_2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pogozheva |first1=Irina D. |last2=Lomize |first2=Andrei L. |title=Evolution and adaptation of single-pass transmembrane proteins |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes |date=February 2018 |volume=1860 |issue=2 |pages=364–377 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.11.002|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of proteins in this class is larger in humans than in the [[model organism]]s ''[[Danio rerio]]'' (zebrafish) and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' (nematode worms), suggesting that genes encoding these proteins have undergone expansion in the [[vertebrate]] and [[mammalian]] lineages.&lt;ref name=pahl_2013  /&gt;

[[Taxon]] A and taxon B are sister groups to each other. Taxa A and B, together with any other [[Extant taxon|extant]] or [[Extinction|extinct]] descendants of their [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA),{{refn|group=Note|A tree diagram inevitably oversimplifies the complicated process of evolution.}} form a [[monophyletic]] group, the [[clade]] AB. Clade AB and taxon C are also sister groups. Taxa A, B, and C, together with all other descendants of their MRCA form the clade ABC. 

The whole clade ABC is itself a subtree of a larger tree which offers yet more sister group relationships, both among the [[Tree_(data_structure)#Terminology_used_in_trees|leaves]] and among larger, more deeply [[Phylogenetic tree#Rooted tree|rooted]] clades. The tree structure shown connects through its root to the rest of the [[Tree of life (biology)|universal tree of life]].

In [[cladistics|cladistic]] standards, taxa A, B, and C may represent specimens, [[species]], [[genera]], or any other taxonomic units. If A and B are at the same taxonomic level, terminology such as ''sister species'' or ''sister genera'' can be used.

== Example ==
[[File:Dinosauria phylogeny (within Archosauriformes).png|thumb|left|600px| {{center|A [[Dinosauria]] phylogeny including two extant taxa: birds ([[Theropoda]]) and crocodiles ([[Suchia]]).}} ]]
The term ''sister group'' is used in [[phylogenetic analysis]], however, only groups identified in the analysis are labeled as "sister groups".

An example is [[birds]], whose commonly cited ''living'' sister group is the [[crocodilia|crocodiles]], but that is true only when discussing [[Neontology|extant organisms]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Padian, Kevin |author2=Lindberg, David R. |author3=Polly, Paul David |date=May 1994 |title=Cladistics and the fossil record: The uses of history |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=63–89 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.000431 |bibcode=1994AREPS..22...63P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kemp |first=T.S. |date=January 1988 |title=Haemothermia or Archosauria? The interrelationships of mammals, birds and crocodiles |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=67–104 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1988.tb01527.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; when other, extinct groups are considered, the relationship between birds and crocodiles appears distant.
Although the bird family tree is rooted in the [[dinosaur]]s, there were a number of other, earlier groups, such as the [[pterosaur]]s, that branched off of the line leading to the dinosaurs after the last common ancestor of [[archosaurs|birds and crocodiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=J.M. |date=2011-06-13 |title=Ancient bird-crocodilian ancestor uncovered |website=Aves Vitae - The lives of birds |url=http://www.avesvitae.org/www.avesvitae.org/News/Entries/2011/6/13_Ancient_Bird-Crocodilian_Ancestor_Uncovered.html |access-date=4 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426091546/http://www.avesvitae.org/www.avesvitae.org/News/Entries/2011/6/13_Ancient_Bird-Crocodilian_Ancestor_Uncovered.html |archive-date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sister group'' must thus be seen as a relative term, with the caveat that the sister group is only the closest relative among the groups/species/specimens that are included in the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Podani |first=János |year=2010 |title=Taxonomy in evolutionary perspective - An essay on the relationships between taxonomy and evolutionary theory |journal=Synbiologia Hungarica |volume=5 |pages=1–42 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/32972918/Podani-Taxonomy-in-evolutionary-perspective-Synbiol-Hung-6-1-42-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases the presence of a recombinase enzyme and the recombination sites is sufficient for the reaction to proceed; in other systems a number of accessory proteins and/or accessory sites are required. Many different [[site-specific recombinase technology|genome modification strategies]], among these [[recombinase-mediated cassette exchange]] (RMCE), an advanced approach for the targeted introduction of transcription units into predetermined genomic loci, rely on SSRs.

Site-specific recombination systems are highly specific, fast, and efficient, even when faced with complex [[eukaryotic]] genomes.&lt;ref name="Sauer1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sauer | first=B. | year=1998 | title=Inducible Gene Targeting in Mice Using the Cre/loxSystem | journal=Methods | volume=14 | issue=4 | pages=381–92 | doi=10.1006/meth.1998.0593 | url=http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/classes/bicd130.SU207/documents/InducCre-LoxMice.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611200722/http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/classes/bicd130.SU207/documents/InducCre-LoxMice.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2011-06-11 | pmid=9608509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are employed naturally in a variety of cellular processes, including bacterial genome [[DNA replication|replication]], differentiation and [[pathogenesis]], and movement of [[mobile genetic elements]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, H.

Recombination sites are typically between 30 and 200 [[nucleotide]]s in length and consist of two motifs with a partial inverted-repeat symmetry, to which the recombinase binds, and which flank a central crossover sequence at which the recombination takes place. The pairs of sites between which the recombination occurs are usually identical, but there are exceptions (e.g. [[Lambda phage#Prophage integration|attP and attB of λ integrase]]).&lt;ref name="Landy1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Landy | first=A. | year=1989 | title=Dynamic, Structural, and Regulatory Aspects of lambda Site-Specific Recombination | journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume=58 | issue=1 | pages=913–41 | doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.58.070189.004405 | pmid=2528323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification: tyrosine- ''vs.'' serine- recombinases==
[[Image:STswap.png|thumb|right|450px|'''Fig. 1. Tyr-Recombinases: Details of the crossover step.'''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top: Traditional view including strand-exchange followed by branch-migration (proofreading). The mechanism occurs in the framework of a synaptic complex (1) including both DNA sites in parallel orientation. While branch-migration explains the specific homology requirements and the reversibility of the process in a straightforward manner, it cannot be reconciled with the motions recombinase subunits have to undergo in three dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom: Current view. Two simultaneous strand-swaps, each depending on the complementarity of three successive bases at (or close to) the edges of the 8-bp spacer (dashed lines indicate base-pairing). Didactic complications arise from the fact that, in this model, the synaptic complex must accommodate both substrates in an anti-parallel orientation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This synaptic complex (1) arises from the association of two individual recombinase subunits ("protomers"; gray ovals) with the respective target site. Its formation depends on inter-protomer contacts and DNA bending, which in turn define the subunits (green) with an active role during the first crossover reaction. Both representations illustrate only one half of the respective pathway. These parts are separated by a Holliday junction/isomerization step before the product (3) can be released.]]
[[Image:SUrot.png|thumb|right|450px|'''Fig. 2. Ser-Recombinases: The (essentially irreversible) subunit-rotation pathway.'''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contrary to Tyr-recombinases, the four participating DNA strands are cut in synchrony at points staggered by only 2 bp (leaving little room for proofreading). Subunit-rotation (180°) permits the exchange of strands while covalently linked to the protein partner. The intermediate exposure of double-strand breaks bears risks of triggering illegitimate recombination and thereby secondary reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, the synaptic complex arises from the association of pre-formed recombinase dimers with the respective target sites (CTD/NTD, C-/N-terminal domain). Like for Tyr-recombinases, each site contains two arms, each accommodating one protomer. As both arms are structured slightly differently, the subunits become conformationally tuned and thereby prepared for their respective role in the  recombination cycle. Contrary to members of the Tyr-class the recombination pathway converts two different substrate sites (attP and attB) to site-hybrids [[site-specific recombinase technology|(attL and attR)]]. This explains the irreversible nature of this particular recombination pathway, which can only be overcome by auxiliary "recombination directionality factors" (RDFs).'']]

Based on amino acid sequence homologies and mechanistic relatedness, most site-specific recombinases are grouped into one of two families: the [[site-specific recombinase technology|tyrosine (Tyr) recombinase family]] or [[site-specific recombinase technology|serine (Ser) recombinase]] family. The names stem from the conserved nucleophilic amino acid residue present in each class of recombinase which is used to attack the DNA and which becomes covalently linked to it during strand exchange. The earliest identified members of the serine recombinase family were known as [[wiktionary:resolvase|resolvase]]s or [[DNA invertase]]s, while the founding member of the tyrosine recombinases, [[lambda phage]] integrase (using attP/B recognition sites), differs from the now well-known enzymes such as [[Cre recombinase|Cre]] (from the [[P1 phage]]) and [[FLP-FRT recombination|FLP]] (from the yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''). Famous serine recombinases include enzymes such as [[gamma-delta resolvase]] (from the Tn''1000'' [[transposon]]), [[Tn3 resolvase]] (from the Tn3 transposon), and [[site-specific recombinase technology|''φ''C31 integrase]] (from the ''φ''C31 phage).&lt;ref name="Stark1995"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Stark | first1=W.M. | last2=Boocock | first2=M.R. | year=1995 | title=Mobile Genetic Elements | publisher=Oxford University Press | chapter=Topological selectivity in site-specific recombination | pages=101–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the individual members of the two recombinase families can perform reactions with the same practical outcomes, the families are unrelated to each other, having different protein structures and reaction mechanisms. Unlike tyrosine recombinases, serine recombinases are highly modular, as was first hinted by biochemical studies&lt;ref name="Abdel-Meguid1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdel-Meguid |first1=S.S. |last2=Grindley |first2=N.D. |last3=Templeton |first3=N.S. |last4=Steitz |first4=T.A. |title=Cleavage of the site-specific recombination protein gamma delta resolvase: the smaller of two fragments binds DNA specifically |journal=Proc.

==Mechanism==
Recombination between two DNA sites begins by the recognition and binding of these sites – one site on each of two separate double-stranded DNA molecules, or at least two distant segments of the same molecule – by the recombinase enzyme. This is followed by [[synapsis]], i.e. bringing the sites together to form the synaptic complex. It is within this synaptic complex that the strand exchange takes place, as the DNA is cleaved and rejoined by controlled [[transesterification]] reactions. During strand exchange, each double-stranded DNA molecule is cut at a fixed point within the crossover region of the recognition site, releasing a [[deoxyribose]] [[hydroxyl group]], while the recombinase enzyme forms a transient [[covalent bond]] to a DNA backbone [[phosphate]]. This [[phosphodiester bond]] between the hydroxyl group of the [[nucleophilic]] [[serine]] or [[tyrosine]] residue conserves the energy that was expended in cleaving the DNA. Energy stored in this bond is subsequently used for the rejoining of the DNA to the corresponding deoxyribose hydroxyl group on the other DNA molecule. The entire reaction therefore proceeds without the need for external energy-rich [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

Although the basic chemical reaction is the same for both tyrosine and serine recombinases, there are some differences between them.&lt;ref name = "turan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turan | first1 = S. | last2 = Bode | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Review: Site-specific recombinases: from tag-and-target- to tag-and-exchange-based genomic modifications | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 25 | issue = 12| pages = 4088–4107 | doi = 10.1096/fj.11-186940 | pmid = 21891781 | s2cid = 7075677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrosine recombinases, such as [[Cre recombinase|Cre]] or [[FLP-FRT recombination|FLP]], cleave one DNA strand at a time at points that are staggered by 6–8bp, linking the 3’ end of the strand to the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine nucleophile (Fig. 1).&lt;ref name="VanDuyne"&gt;{{cite book | last=Van Duyne | first=G.D. | year=2002 | title=Mobile DNA II | chapter=A structural view of tyrosine recombinase site-specific recombination | pages=93–117 | publisher=ASM Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strand exchange then proceeds via a crossed strand intermediate analogous to the [[Holliday junction]] in which only one pair of strands has been exchanged.&lt;ref name="Holliday1964"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Holliday | first=R. | year=1964 | title=A mechanism for gene conversion in fungi | journal=Genetics Research | volume=5 | pages=282–304 | url=http://www.bio.unc.edu/Courses/2008Spring/Biol625/Holliday1964.pdf | doi=10.1017/S0016672300001233 | issue=2| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grainge1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Grainge | first1=I. | last2=Jayaram | first2=M. | year=1999 | title=The integrase family of recombinases: organization and function of the active site | journal=Molecular Microbiology | volume=33 | issue=3 | pages=449–56 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01493.x | pmid=10577069| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism and control of serine recombinases is much less well understood. This group of enzymes was only discovered in the mid-1990s and is still relatively small. The now classical members [[gamma-delta]] and [[Tn3 resolvase]], but also new additions like φC31-, Bxb1-, and R4 integrases, cut all four DNA strands simultaneously at points that are staggered by 2 bp (Fig. 2).&lt;ref name="Stark1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stark | first1=W.M. | last2=Boocock | first2=M.R. | year=1992 | title=Catalysis by site-specific recombinases |doi=10.1016/0168-9525(92)90327-Z| journal=Trends in Genetics | volume=8 | issue=12 | pages=432–9 | pmid=1337225 | last3=Sherratt | first3=DJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; During cleavage, a protein–DNA bond is formed via a [[transesterification]] reaction, in which a [[phosphodiester bond]] is replaced by a phosphoserine bond between a 5’ phosphate at the cleavage site and the hydroxyl group of the conserved serine residue (S10 in resolvase).&lt;ref name="Reed1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Reed | first1=R.R. | last2=Grindley | first2=N.D. | year=1981 | title=Transposon-mediated site-specific recombination in vitro: DNA cleavage and protein-DNA linkage at the recombination site | journal=Cell | volume=25 | issue=3 | pages=721–8 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(81)90179-3 | pmid=6269756| s2cid=28410571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Reed | first1=R.R. | last2=Moser | first2=C.D. | year=1984 | title=Resolvase-mediated recombination intermediates contain a serine residue covalently linked to DNA | journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol | volume = 49 | pages = 245–9 | pmid=6099239 | doi=10.1101/sqb.1984.049.01.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still not entirely clear how the strand exchange occurs after the DNA has been cleaved. However, it has been shown that the strands are exchanged while covalently linked to the protein, with a resulting net rotation of 180°.&lt;ref name="Stark1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stark | first1=M.W. | year=1989 | title=Site-specific recombination by Tn 3 resolvase: topological changes in the forward and reverse reactions | journal=Cell | volume=58 | issue=4 | pages=779–90 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(89)90111-6 | pmid=2548736 | last2=Sherratt | first2=DJ | last3=Boocock | first3=MR| s2cid=46508016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stark | first1=W.M. | last2=Boocock | first2=M.R. | year=1994 | title=The Linkage Change of a Knotting Reaction Catalysed by Tn3 Resolvase | journal=Journal of Molecular Biology | volume=239 | issue=1 | pages=25–36 | doi=10.1006/jmbi.1994.1348 | pmid=8196046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most quoted (but not the only) model accounting for these facts is the "subunit rotation model" (Fig. 2).&lt;ref name="turan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarkis2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sarkis | first1=G.J | year=2001 | title = A model for the gamma-delta resolvase synaptic complex | journal=Molecular Cell | volume=8 | issue=3 | pages=623–31 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00334-3 | pmid = 11583624 | last2 = Murley | first2 = LL | last3 = Leschziner | first3 = AE | last4 = Boocock | first4 = MR | last5 = Stark | first5 = WM | last6 = Grindley | first6 = ND| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent of the model, DNA duplexes are situated outside of the protein complex, and large movement of the protein is needed to achieve the strand exchange. In this case the recombination sites are slightly asymmetric, which allows the enzyme to tell apart the left and right ends of the site. When generating products, left ends are always joined to the right ends of their partner sites, and vice versa. This causes different recombination hybrid sites to be reconstituted in the recombination products. Joining of left ends to left or right to right is avoided due to the asymmetric “overlap” sequence between the staggered points of top and bottom strand exchange, which is in stark contrast to the mechanism employed by tyrosine recombinases.&lt;ref name="turan" /&gt;

The reaction catalysed by Cre-recombinase, for instance, may lead to excision of the DNA segment flanked by the two sites (Fig. 3A), but may also lead to integration or inversion of the orientation of the flanked DNA segment (Fig. 3B). What the outcome of the reaction will be is dictated mainly by the relative locations and orientations of the sites that are to be recombined, but also by the innate specificity of the site-specific system in question. Excisions and inversions occur if the recombination takes place between two sites that are found on the same molecule (intramolecular recombination), and if the sites are in the same (direct repeat) or in an opposite orientation (inverted repeat), respectively. Insertions, on the other hand, take place if the recombination occurs on sites that are situated on two different DNA molecules (intermolecular recombination), provided that at least one of these molecules is circular. Most site-specific systems are highly specialised, catalysing only one of these different types of reaction, and have evolved to ignore the sites that are in the "wrong" orientation.

== Definition of size asymmetry ==

Resource competition can vary from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size, known also as [[scramble competition]]) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry can be described by the parameter θ in the following equation focusing on the partition of the resource r among n individuals of sizes Bj.&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwinning Fox 1995"&gt;Schwinning, S. &amp; Fox, G. A. Population-dynamic consequences of competitive symmetry in annual plants. Oikos 72, 422-432, [[doi:10.2307/3546128]] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{#tag:math|r_i=r(B_i)^\theta}}
{{#tag:math|/\sum_{j=1}^{n}(B_j)^\theta}}

ri refers to the amount of resource consumed by individual i in the neighbourhood of j. When θ =1, competition is perfectly size symmetric, e.g. if a large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor, the large individual will acquire twice the amount of that resource (i.e. both individuals will exploit the same amount of resource per biomass unit). When θ &gt;1 competition is size-asymmetric, e.g.  if large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor and θ =2, the large individual will acquire four times the amount of that resource (i.e. the large individual will exploit twice the amount of resource per biomass unit). As θ increases, competition becomes more size-asymmetric and larger plants get larger amounts of resource per unit biomass compared with smaller plants.

== Differences in size-asymmetry among resources in plant communities ==

Competition among plants for [[light]] is size-asymmetric because of the directionality of its supply.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1990"/&gt; Higher [[leaves]] shade lower leaves but not vice versa.  Competition for [[nutrients]] appears to be relatively size-symmetric,&lt;ref&gt;Berntson, G. M. &amp; Wayne, P. M. Characterizing the size dependence of resource acquisition within crowded plant populations.

A. &amp; Hector, A. Competition for Light Causes Plant Biodiversity Loss After Eutrophication. Science 324, 636-638, [[doi:10.1126/science.1169640]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borer, E. T. et al. Herbivores and nutrients control grassland plant diversity via light limitation. Nature 508, 517-520, [[doi:10.1038/nature13144]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still a debate whether this phenomenon is related to the size-asymmetry of light competition&lt;ref name="Lamb et al 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016"/&gt; or to other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Harpole, W. S. &amp; Tilman, D. Grassland species loss resulting from reduced niche dimension. Nature 446, 791-793, [[doi:10.1038/nature05684]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting assumptions about size-asymmetry characterise the two leading and competing theories in plant ecology,&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016" /&gt; the [[R* rule|R* theory]] and the [[Universal adaptive strategy theory|CSR theory]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size-symmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to withstand low level of resources (known as the [[R* rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D. Resource competition and community structure. Monographs in population biology 17, 1-296 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to grow fast and attain a large size.&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J. P. Evidence for existence of three primary strategies in plants and its relevance to ecological and evolutionary theory. American Naturalist 111, 1169-1194 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Size-asymmetric competition affects also several [[evolutionary]] processes in relation to trait selection. Evolution of plant height is highly affected by asymmetric light competition.&lt;ref name="Tilman 1988"&gt;Tilman, D. Plant strategies and the dynamics and structure of plant communities. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA. 360. p. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falster Westoby 2003"&gt;Falster, D. S. &amp; Westoby, M. Plant height and evolutionary games. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 18, 337-343, [[doi:10.1016/s0169-5347(03)00061-2]] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Theory predicts that only under asymmetric light competition, plants will grow upward and invest in [[wood]] production at  the expense of investment in leaves, or in [[reproductive]] organs ([[flowers]] and [[fruits]]).&lt;ref name="Tilman 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Falster Westoby 2003"/&gt;  Consistent with this, there is evidence that plant height increases as water availability increases,&lt;ref&gt;Klein, T., Randin, C. &amp; Korner, C. Water availability predicts forest canopy height at the global scale. Ecology Letters 18, 1311-1320, [[doi:10.1111/ele.12525]] (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; presumably due to increase in the relative importance of size-asymmetric competition for light. Similarly, investment in the size of seeds at the expense of their number may be more effective undersize-asymmetric resource competition, since larger seeds tend to produce larger seedlings that are better competitors.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"&gt;Falster, D. S., Moles, A. T. &amp; Westoby, M. A general model for the scaling of offspring size and adult size. American Naturalist 172, 299-317, [[doi:10.1086/589889]] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Size-asymmetric competition can be exploited in managing plant communities, such as the suppression of [[weed]] in [[crop]] fields.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"/&gt;  Weeds are a greater problem for farmer in dry than in moist environments, in large part because crops can suppress weeds much more effectively undersize-asymmetric competition for light than under more size-symmetric competition below ground.

The '''smallest organisms''' found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of [[organism]] size, including [[volume]], [[mass]], [[height]], [[length]], or [[genome]] size.
 
Given the incomplete nature of [[Knowledge#Scientific knowledge|scientific knowledge]], it is possible that the smallest organism is undiscovered. Furthermore, there is some debate over the definition of [[life]], and what entities qualify as organisms; consequently the smallest known organism (microorganism) is debatable.

== Microorganisms ==

=== Obligate endosymbiotic bacteria ===
The genome of ''[[Nasuia deltocephalinicola]]'', a [[symbiosis|symbiont]] of the European pest leafhopper, ''[[Macrosteles|Macrosteles quadripunctulatus]]'', consists of a [[Circular bacterial chromosome|circular chromosome]] of 112,031 base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Gordon M.|last2=Abbà|first2=Simona|last3=Kube|first3=Michael|last4=Marzachì|first4=Cristina|title=Complete Genome Sequences of the Obligate Symbionts 'Candidatus Sulcia muelleri' and "Ca. Nasuia deltocephalinicola" from the Pestiferous Leafhopper Macrosteles quadripunctulatus (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae)|journal=Genome Announcements|date=25 February 2016|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e01604–15|doi=10.1128/genomeA.01604-15|language=en|issn=2169-8287|pmc=4722273|pmid=26798106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genome of ''[[Nanoarchaeum equitans]]'' is 490,885 nucleotides long.

=== ''Pelagibacter ubique'' ===
[[File:Pelagibacter.jpg|thumb|Microscopic photo of the bacterium ''[[Pelagibacter ubique]]'']]
''[[Pelagibacter ubique]]'' is one of the smallest known '''free-living''' bacteria, with a length of {{cvt|370|to|890|nm|mm}} and an average cell diameter of {{cvt|120|to|200|nm|mm}}. They also have the smallest free-living bacterium genome: 1.3 Mbp, 1354 protein genes, 35 RNA genes. They are one of the most common and smallest organisms in the ocean, with their total weight exceeding that of all fish in the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Pelagibacter_ubique|title=Pelagibacter ubique - microbewiki|website=microbewiki.kenyon.edu|access-date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' ===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', a [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[bacterium]] which lives in the [[primate]] bladder, waste disposal organs, genital, and respiratory tracts, is thought to be the smallest known organism capable of independent [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[reproduction]]. With a size of approximately 200 to 300 [[nanometer|nm]], ''M. genitalium'' is an [[Ultramicrobacteria|ultramicrobacterium]], smaller than other small bacteria, including [[rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydia]]. However, the vast majority of bacterial strains have not been studied, and the marine ultramicrobacterium ''Sphingomonas'' sp. strain RB2256 is reported to have passed through a {{cvt|220|nm|mm}} [[ultrafiltration|ultrafilter]]. A complicating factor is nutrient-downsized bacteria, bacteria that become much smaller due to a lack of available [[nutrient]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/sep2001/1001464156.Gb.r.html |title=Re: What is the smallest living thing? |publisher=Madsci.org |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Nanoarchaeum'' ===
[[File:Urzwerg.jpg|thumb|upright|Two ''[[Nanoarchaeum equitans]]'' and [[Archaea|archaeon]] host, ''[[Ignicoccus]]'']]

''[[Nanoarchaeum equitans]]'' is a species of [[microbe]] {{cvt|200|to|500|nm|mm}} in diameter. It was discovered in 2002 in a [[hydrothermal vent]] off the coast of [[Iceland]] by [[Karl Stetter]]. A [[thermophile]] that grows in near-boiling temperatures, ''Nanoarchaeum'' appears to be an obligatory [[symbiosis|symbiont]] on the [[archaea|archaeon]] ''[[Ignicoccus]]''; it must be in contact with the host organism to survive. [[Guinness World Records]] recognizes ''Nanoarchaeum equitans'' as the smallest living organism.

=== Eukaryotes (Eukaryota) ===
[[Prasinophyte]] [[alga]]e of the genus ''[[Ostreococcus]]'' are the smallest free-living [[eukaryote]]. The single cell of an ''Ostreococcus'' measures {{cvt|0.8|μm|mm}} across.

=== Viruses ===
Some [[biologist]]s consider [[virus]]es to be non-living because they lack a [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure and cannot [[metabolism|metabolize]] by themselves, requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesize new products. Some hold that, because viruses do have [[genetic material]] and can employ the metabolism of their host, they can be considered organisms. Also, an emerging concept that is gaining traction among some virologists is that of the [[virocell]] {{Circular reference|date=October 2022}}, in which the actual [[phenotype]] of a virus is the infected cell, and the virus particle (or ''virion'') is merely a reproductive or dispersal stage, much like pollen or a spore.&lt;ref name="Forterre 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. Forterre |title=The virocell concept and environmental microbiology|journal=The ISME Journal|year=2012|doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.110 |volume=7 |issue=2|pages=233–236|pmc=3554396 |pmid=23038175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest viruses in terms of genome size are single-stranded DNA ([[SsDNA virus|ssDNA]]) viruses. Perhaps the most famous is the [[bacteriophage]] [[Phi-X174]] with a genome size of 5,386 [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/265687a0 |title=Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage ΦX174 DNA |year=1977 |last1=Sanger |first1=F. |last2=Air |first2=G.

For example, [[Porcine circovirus]] type 1 has a genome of 1,759 nucleotides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=APorcine circoviruses--small but powerful |vauthors=Finsterbusch T, Mankertz A |year=2009 | journal = Virus Research | volume = 143 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–183 | pmid=19647885 | doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2009.02.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[capsid]] diameter of {{cvt|17|nm|mm}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phene.cpmc.columbia.edu/ICTVdB/WWW/16002005.htm ICTVdB Virus Description – 00.016.0.01.005.

However, the two capsids making up the virus are fused; divided, the capsids would be {{cvt|15|nm|mm}} in length. Other environmentally characterized ssDNA viruses such as CRESS DNA viruses, among others, can have genomes that are considerably less than 2,000 nucleotides.&lt;ref name="Rosario 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K.

The smallest [[RNA virus]] in terms of [[genome]] size is phage BZ13 strain T72 at 3,393 nucleotides length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ483838 | title= Enterobacteria phage BZ13 strain T72, complete genome |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses using both DNA and RNA in their replication ([[retrovirus]]es) range in size from 7,040 to 12,195 nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |section=Table 2: Sizes of Retroviral LTR Components (U3-R-U5) and Genomes |title=Retroviruses |veditors=Coffin JM, Hughes SH, Varmus HE | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | date=1997 | isbn=0-87969-571-4 |section-url=https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19417/table/A7789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The smallest double-stranded [[DNA virus]]es are the [[Hepadnaviridae|hepadnaviruses]] such as [[hepatitis B]], at 3.2 kb and {{cvt|42|nm|mm}}; [[parvovirus]]es have smaller capsids, at {{cvt|18|-|26|nm|mm}}, but larger genomes, at 5 kb. It is important to consider other self-replicating genetic elements, such as [[Satellite (biology)|satelliviruses]], [[viroid]]s and [[ribozymes]].

'''Smart ligands''' are affinity [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] selected with pre-defined equilibrium (&lt;math&gt;K_{d}&lt;/math&gt;), kinetic (&lt;math&gt;k_{off}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_{on}&lt;/math&gt;) and thermodynamic (ΔH, ΔS) parameters of [[biomolecular]] interaction.

Ligands with desired parameters can be selected from large combinatorial libraries of [[biopolymer]]s using instrumental separation techniques with well-described kinetic behaviour, such as [[kinetic capillary electrophoresis]] (KCE), [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR), [[microscale thermophoresis]] (MST),&lt;ref name=Baaske&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baaske P, Wienken CJ, Reineck P, Duhr S, Braun D | title = Optical Thermophoresis quantifies Buffer dependence of Aptamer Binding | journal = Angew.

Smart ligands can find a set of unique applications in biomedical research, drug discovery and proteomic studies. For example, a panel of DNA smart aptamers has been recently used to develop affinity analysis of proteins with ultra-wide dynamic range of measured concentrations.

'''Selective microfluidics-based ligand enrichment followed by sequencing (SMiLE-seq)''' is a technique developed for the rapid identification of [[DNA|DNA binding]] specificities and affinities of full length monomeric and dimeric transcription factors in a fast and semi-high-throughput fashion. 

SMiLE-seq works by loading ''[[in vitro]]'' transcribed and translated “bait” transcription factors into a [[microfluidic]] device in combination with [[DNA|DNA molecules]]. Bound transcription factor-DNA complexes are then isolated from the device, which is followed by sequencing and sequence data analysis to characterize binding motifs. Specialized software is used to determine the DNA binding properties of [[monomeric]] or [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimeric]] transcription factors to help predict their ''[[in vivo]]'' DNA binding activity. 

SMiLE-seq combines three critical functions that makes it unique from existing techniques: (1) the use of capillary pumps to optimize the loading of samples, (2) trapping [[Molecule|molecular]] interactions on the surface of the microfluidic device through immunocapture of target transcription factors, (3) enabling the selection of DNA that is specifically bound to [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]] from a pool of random [[DNA sequences]].&lt;ref name="SMiLE-seq"&gt;{{cite journal

==Background==
Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms used to govern essential cellular processes is one of the most intensely studied branches of science. Cellular regulatory networks can be incredibly complex, and often involve the coordination of multiple processes that begin with the modulation of [[gene expression]]. The binding of [[Transcription factor|transcription factor molecules]] to DNA, either alone or in combination with other transcription factors, is used to control gene expression in response to both intra- and extracellular stimuli. 

Characterizing the binding mechanisms and specificities of transcription factors to specific regions of DNA – and identifying these transcription factors – is a fundamental component of the process of resolving cellular regulatory dynamics.&lt;ref name="transcription"&gt;{{cite journal

While many unique transcription factor-DNA binding interactions have been characterized using these methods, it is estimated that this described fraction represents fewer than 50% of the transcription factors present in humans. The development of SMiLE-seq technology has provided an attractive alternative method with the potential to facilitate identification and characterization of previously undescribed transcription factor-DNA binding interactions.&lt;ref name="SMiLE-seq" /&gt;

==Workflow of SMiLE-seq==
[[File:SMiLE-seq workflow 2.jpg|thumb|SMiLE-seq workflow]]
SMiLE-seq uses a microfluidic device into which transcription factors, which have been transcribed and translated ''in vitro'', are loaded. Transcription factor samples (~0.3&amp;nbsp;ng) are modified by the addition of an enhanced green [[fluorescent protein]] (eGFP) tag and combined with both target double-stranded DNA molecules (~8 pmol) tagged with [[Cyanine dye|Cyanine Dye5]] (Cy5) and a double-stranded competitive DNA model, poly-dIdC, which operates as a negative control to limit spurious binding interactions. 

When multiple transcription factors are simultaneously analyzed (e.g., when characterization of potential [[heterodimeric]] binding interactions is performed), each transcription factor is tagged with a correspondingly unique fluorescent tag. Samples are pumped through the microfluidic device in a passive, twenty-minute process that utilizes [[capillary action]] in a series of parallel channels. eGFP-tagged transcription factors are immunocaptured using anchored biotinylated anti-eGFP antibodies. 

Mechanical depression of a button traps bound transcription factor-DNA complexes, and fluorescent analysis is performed. Fluorescent readouts that identify the presence of multiple fluorescent tags associated with a single antibody indicate heterodimeric binding interactions. The presence of DNA is confirmed by Cy5 signal detection. A [[polydimethylsiloxane]] membrane on the button surface captures successfully bound transcription factor-DNA complexes, while unbound transcription factors and targets are washed away. 

Following the removal of unbound components, bound DNA molecules are collected, pooled, and amplified. Sequencing is subsequently performed using NextSeq 500 or HiSeq2000 sequencing lanes. Sequence data is used to develop a seed sequence, which is then probed for functional motifs using a uniquely developed hidden [[Markov model]]-based software pipeline.&lt;ref name="SMiLE-seq" /&gt;

==Advantages==
The use of microfluidics in SMiLE-seq offers three main advantages when compared to current techniques used to measure protein-DNA interactions (e.g., ChIP-seq, HT-SELEX, and [[Protein microarray|protein binding microarrays]]). 

* SMiLE-seg requires fewer transcription factors than other similar techniques (only picograms are required). 
* The process is much faster than other techniques (it requires less than an hour, as compared to days). 
* Lastly, SMiLE-seq is not limited by the length of target DNA (a limitation of protein binding [[Microarray|microarrays]]), and is not biased towards stronger affinity protein-DNA interactions (a major limitation of HT-SELEX). 

Existing technologies have been found to be laborious and technically complex due to improper transcription factor expression or loss of transcription factor-DNA binding properties ''in vitro''. The ability of many transcription factors to bind DNA is dependent on heterodimer formation, and therefore requires the presence of a specific dimer partner for binding. This has been shown to yield incomplete results if transcription factors are individually tested. Heterodimer combinations have been shown to range from 3000 to 25000, and many remain uncharacterized. 

A technology like SMiLE-seq, which is able to detect these dimeric interactions, is essential to broaden current knowledge and characterization of transcription factor-DNA binding profiles. Additionally, previous technologies have used transcription factor probes in their truncated form, which may reduce their ability to bind and dimerize. SMiLE-seq enables robust identification of DNA binding specificities of full length, previously uncharacterized transcription factors. Furthermore, SMiLE-seq is able to identify transcription factor binding sites over a wide range of binding affinities, which represents a significant limitation of other technologies. In theory SMiLE-seq is not limited to only protein-DNA interactions and may potentially be utilized to study protein-RNA binding properties once the technology has been developed further.&lt;ref name="SMiLE-seq" /&gt;

==Limitations==
The primary limitation of SMiLE-seq is that the technique can only be used to characterize the binding interactions of previously identified transcription factors, as the method requires ''in vitro'' transcription and translation of the transcription factors prior to their combination with DNA molecules. Additionally, previous studies have shown that fluorescent protein tags can affect the binding affinity of proteins to their targets.&lt;ref name="Binding Affinity"&gt;{{cite journal

|pmc=2721158
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effect of the specific fluorescent protein tags on binding affinity would have to be investigated to determine whether this would impact specific protein-DNA interactions found using this technology. Further development of SMiLE-seq may involve modifying transcription factor expression conditions to increase the success of analysis.&lt;ref name="SMiLE-seq" /&gt;

      <text bytes="38169" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Measurement of genetic variations}}
'''SNP genotyping''' is the measurement of genetic variations of [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) between members of a species. It is a form of [[genotyping]], which is the measurement of more general genetic variation. SNPs are one of the most common types of genetic variation. An SNP is a single base pair mutation at a specific [[locus (genetics)|locus]], usually consisting of two [[alleles]] (where the [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|rare allele frequency]] is &gt; 1%). SNPs are found to be involved in the [[etiology]] of many human diseases and are becoming of particular interest in [[pharmacogenetics]]. Because SNPs are conserved during evolution, they have been proposed as markers for use in quantitative trait loci ([[QTL]]) analysis and in [[association studies]] in place of [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]]. The use of SNPs is being extended in the [[HapMap]] project, which aims to provide the minimal set of SNPs needed to genotype the human genome. SNPs can also provide a genetic fingerprint for use in identity testing.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harbron S, Rapley R | title = Molecular analysis and genome discovery | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. | location = London | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-471-49919-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase of interest in SNPs has been reflected by the furious development of a diverse range of SNP genotyping methods.

==Hybridization-based methods==

Several applications have been developed that interrogate SNPs by hybridizing complementary DNA probes to the SNP site. The challenge of this approach is reducing cross-hybridization between the allele-specific probes.  This challenge is generally overcome by manipulating the hybridization stringency conditions.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;

===Dynamic allele-specific hybridization===
[[Image:SNP-Dash-1updated.png|thumbnail|100px|right]]
Dynamic allele-specific hybridization (DASH) genotyping takes advantage of the differences in the melting temperature in DNA that results from the instability of mismatched base pairs. The process can be vastly automated and encompasses a few simple principles.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

In the first step, a genomic segment is amplified and attached to a bead through a [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR reaction]] with a biotinylated primer. In the second step, the amplified product is attached to a [[streptavidin]] column and washed with NaOH to remove the unbiotinylated strand. An [[allele-specific oligonucleotide]] is then added in the presence of a molecule that fluoresces when bound to double-stranded DNA. The intensity is then measured as temperature is increased until the [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|melting temperature (Tm)]] can be determined. A SNP will result in a lower than expected Tm.&lt;ref name=Howell1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howell WM, Jobs M, Gyllensten U, Brookes AJ | title = Dynamic allele-specific hybridization. A new method for scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–88 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9920276 | doi = 10.1038/5270 | s2cid = 37367067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because DASH genotyping is measuring a quantifiable change in Tm, it is capable of measuring all types of mutations, not just SNPs. Other benefits of DASH include its ability to work with label free probes and its simple design and performance conditions.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

===Molecular beacons===
[[Image:SNP-Molecularprobe-1.png|right]]
SNP detection through [[molecular beacon]]s makes use of a specifically engineered single-stranded oligonucleotide probe. The oligonucleotide is designed such that there are complementary regions at each end and a probe sequence located in between.  This design allows the probe to take on a hairpin, or stem-loop, structure in its natural, isolated state. Attached to one end of the probe is a fluorophore and to the other end a fluorescence quencher. Because of the stem-loop structure of the probe, the fluorophore is in close proximity to the quencher, thus preventing the molecule from emitting any fluorescence. The molecule is also engineered such that only the probe sequence is complementary to the genomic DNA that will be used in the assay (Abravaya et al. 2003).

If the probe sequence of the molecular beacon encounters its target genomic DNA during the assay, it will anneal and hybridize. Because of the length of the probe sequence, the hairpin segment of the probe will be denatured in favour of forming a longer, more stable probe-target hybrid. This conformational change permits the fluorophore and quencher to be free of their tight proximity due to the hairpin association, allowing the molecule to fluoresce.

If on the other hand, the probe sequence encounters a target sequence with as little as one non-complementary nucleotide, the molecular beacon will preferentially stay in its natural hairpin state and no fluorescence will be observed, as the fluorophore remains quenched. [[Image:SNP-Molecularprobe-2.png|right|thumbnail]]

The unique design of these molecular beacons allows for a simple diagnostic assay to identify SNPs at a given location. If a molecular beacon is designed to match a wild-type allele and another to match a mutant of the allele, the two can be used to identify the genotype of an individual. If only the first probe's fluorophore wavelength is detected during the assay then the individual is homozygous to the wild type. If only the second probe's wavelength is detected then the individual is homozygous to the mutant allele. Finally, if both wavelengths are detected, then both molecular beacons must be hybridizing to their complements and thus the individual must contain both alleles and be heterozygous.

===SNP microarrays===
In [[SNP array|high-density oligonucleotide SNP arrays]], hundreds of thousands of probes are arrayed on a small chip, allowing for many SNPs to be interrogated simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;  Because SNP alleles only differ in one nucleotide and because it is difficult to achieve optimal hybridization conditions for all probes on the array, the target DNA has the potential to hybridize to mismatched probes.  This is addressed somewhat by using several redundant probes to interrogate each SNP.  Probes are designed to have the SNP site in several different locations as well as containing mismatches to the SNP allele. By comparing the differential amount of hybridization of the target DNA to each of these redundant probes, it is possible to determine specific homozygous and heterozygous alleles.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt; Although oligonucleotide microarrays have a comparatively lower specificity and sensitivity, the scale of SNPs that can be interrogated is a major benefit.  The [[Affymetrix]] Human SNP 5.0 GeneChip performs a genome-wide assay that can genotype over 500,000 human SNPs (Affymetrix 2007)..

==Enzyme-based methods==

A broad range of enzymes including [[DNA ligase]], [[DNA polymerase]] and [[nucleases]] have been employed to generate high-fidelity SNP genotyping methods.

===Restriction fragment length polymorphism===
[[Restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) is considered to be the simplest and earliest method to detect SNPs. SNP-RFLP makes use of the many different restriction endonucleases and their high affinity to unique and specific restriction sites.  By performing a digestion on a genomic sample and determining fragment lengths through a gel assay it is possible to ascertain whether or not the enzymes cut the expected restriction sites. A failure to cut the genomic sample results in an identifiably larger than expected fragment implying that there is a mutation at the point of the restriction site which is rendering it protection from nuclease activity.

Unfortunately, the combined factors of the high complexity of most eukaryotic genomes, the requirement for specific endonucleases, the fact that the exact mutation cannot necessarily be resolved in a single experiment, and the slow nature of gel assays make RFLP a poor choice for high throughput analysis.

===PCR-based methods===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Arms-PCR Image.jpg|link=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/253/figure/F4|Schematic illustration of primer design for the tetra-primer ARMS PCR (redrawn from Ye et al., 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = You F.

Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR, or ARMS-PCR, employs two pairs of primers to amplify two alleles in one PCR reaction. The primers are designed such that the two primer pairs overlap at a SNP location but each match perfectly to only one of the possible SNPs. The basis of the invention is that unexpectedly, oligonucleotides with a mismatched 3'-residue will not function as primers in the PCR under appropriate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton CR, Graham A, Heptinstall LE, Powell SJ, Summers C, Kalsheker N, Smith JC, Markham AF | display-authors = 6 | title = Analysis of any point mutation in DNA.

The two primer pairs are also designed such that their PCR products are of a significantly different length allowing for easily distinguishable bands by gel electrophoresis or melt temperature analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bulduk BK, Kiliç HB, Bekircan-Kurt CE, Haliloğlu G, Erdem Özdamar S, Topaloğlu H, Kocaefe YÇ | title = A Novel Amplification-Refractory Mutation System-PCR Strategy to Screen ''MT-TL1'' Pathogenic Variants in Patient Repositories | journal = Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–170 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 32167396 | doi = 10.1089/gtmb.2019.0079 | s2cid = 212693790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Birdsell DN, Pearson T, Price EP, Hornstra HM, Nera RD, Stone N, Gruendike J, Kaufman EL, Pettus AH, Hurbon AN, Buchhagen JL, Harms NJ, Chanturia G, Gyuranecz M, Wagner DM, Keim PS | display-authors = 6 | title = Melt analysis of mismatch amplification mutation assays (Melt-MAMA): a functional study of a cost-effective SNP genotyping assay in bacterial models | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e32866 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22438886 | pmc = 3306377 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0032866.s002 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In examining the results, if a genomic sample is homozygous, then the PCR products that result will be from the primer that matches the SNP location and the outer opposite-strand primer, as well from the two outer primers. If the genomic sample is heterozygous, then products will result from the primer of each allele and their respective outer primer counterparts as well as the outer primers.

An alternative strategy is to run multiple qPCR reactions with different primer sets that target each allele separately. Well-designed primers will amplify their target SNP at a much earlier cycle than the other SNPs. This allows more than two alleles to be distinguished, although an individual qPCR reaction is required for each SNP. To achieve high enough specificity, the primer sequence may require placement of an artificial mismatch near its 3'-end, which is an approach generally known as Taq-MAMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li B, Kadura I, Fu DJ, Watson DE | title = Genotyping with TaqMAMA | journal = Genomics | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–320 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14706460 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2003.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flap endonuclease===
[[Image:SNP-invader-1.jpg|right|thumbnail]]
[[Flap endonuclease]] (FEN) is an endonuclease that catalyzes structure-specific cleavage.  This cleavage is highly sensitive to mismatches and can be used to interrogate SNPs with a high degree of specificity&lt;ref name=Olivier2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olivier M | title = The Invader assay for SNP genotyping | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 573 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 103–110 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15829241 | pmc = 2771639 | doi = 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.08.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the basic [[Invader assay|'''Invader''' assay]], a FEN called cleavase is combined with two specific oligonucleotide probes, that together with the target DNA, can form a tripartite structure recognized by cleavase.&lt;ref name=Olivier2005/&gt;  The first probe, called the '''Invader''' oligonucleotide is complementary to the 3’ end of the target DNA.  The last base of the '''Invader''' oligonucleotide is a non-matching base that overlaps the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA.  The second probe is an allele-specific probe which is complementary to the 5’ end of the target DNA, but also extends past the 3’ side of the SNP nucleotide.  The allele-specific probe will contain a base complementary to the SNP nucleotide. If the target DNA contains the desired allele, the Invader and allele-specific probes will bind to the target DNA forming the tripartite structure.  This structure is recognized by cleavase, which will cleave and release the 3’ end of the allele-specific probe. If the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA is not complementary to the allele-specific probe, the correct tripartite structure is not formed and no cleavage occurs.  The '''Invader''' assay is usually coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system to detect the cleavage event. In this setup, a quencher molecule is attached to the 3’ end and a fluorophore is attached to the 5’ end of the allele-specific probe.  If cleavage occurs, the fluorophore will be separated from the quencher molecule generating a detectable signal.&lt;ref name=Olivier2005/&gt;

Only minimal cleavage occurs with mismatched probes making the '''Invader''' assay highly specific.  However, in its original format, only one SNP allele could be interrogated per reaction sample and it required a large amount of target DNA to generate a detectable signal in a reasonable time frame.&lt;ref name=Olivier2005/&gt; Several developments have extended the original '''Invader''' assay. By carrying out secondary FEN cleavage reactions, the [[Serial Invasive Signal Amplification Reaction]] (SISAR) allows both SNP alleles to be interrogated in a single reaction.  SISAR '''Invader''' assay also requires less target DNA, improving the sensitivity of the original '''Invader''' assay.&lt;ref name=Olivier2005/&gt;  The assay has also been adapted in several ways for use in a high-throughput format.  In one platform, the allele-specific probes are anchored to microspheres. When cleavage by FEN generates a detectable fluorescent signal, the signal is measured using flow-cytometry. The sensitivity of flow-cytometry, eliminates the need for PCR amplification of the target DNA (Rao et al. 2003). These high-throughput platforms have not progressed beyond the proof-of-principle stage and so far the '''Invader''' system has not been used in any large scale SNP genotyping projects.&lt;ref name=Olivier2005/&gt;

===Primer extension===
Primer extension is a two step process that first involves the hybridization of a probe to the bases immediately upstream of the SNP nucleotide followed by a ‘mini-sequencing’ reaction, in which DNA polymerase extends the hybridized primer by adding a base that is complementary to the SNP nucleotide.  This incorporated base is detected and determines the SNP allele (Goelet et al. 1999; Syvanen 2001).  Because primer extension is based on the highly accurate DNA polymerase enzyme, the method is generally very reliable. Primer extension is able to genotype most SNPs under very similar reaction conditions making it also highly flexible.  The primer extension method is used in a number of assay formats.  These formats use a wide range of detection techniques that include [[MALDI-TOF|MALDI-TOF Mass spectrometry]] (see [[Sequenom]]) and [[ELISA]]-like methods.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;

Generally, there are two main approaches which use the incorporation of either fluorescently labeled [[dideoxynucleotides]] (ddNTP) or fluorescently labeled deoxynucleotides (dNTP).  With ddNTPs, probes hybridize to the target DNA immediately upstream of SNP nucleotide, and a single, ddNTP complementary to the SNP allele is added to the 3’ end of the probe (the missing 3'-hydroxyl in didioxynucleotide prevents further nucleotides from being added). Each ddNTP is labeled with a different fluorescent signal allowing for the detection of all four alleles in the same reaction. With dNTPs, allele-specific probes have 3’ bases which are complementary to each of the SNP alleles being interrogated. If the target DNA contains an allele complementary to the probe's 3’ base, the target DNA will completely hybridize to the probe, allowing DNA polymerase to extend from the 3’ end of the probe.  This is detected by the incorporation of the fluorescently labeled dNTPs onto the end of the probe.  If the target DNA does not contain an allele complementary to the probe's 3’ base, the target DNA will produce a mismatch at the 3’ end of the probe and DNA polymerase will not be able to extend from the 3' end of the probe. The benefit of the second approach is that several labeled dNTPs may get incorporated into the growing strand, allowing for increased signal.  However, DNA polymerase in some rare cases, can extend from mismatched 3’ probes giving a false positive result.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;

A different approach is used by ''[[Sequenom]]'''s iPLEX SNP genotyping method, which uses a MassARRAY mass spectrometer.  Extension probes are designed in such a way that 40 different SNP assays can be amplified and analyzed in a PCR cocktail. The extension reaction uses ddNTPs as above, but the detection of the SNP allele is dependent on the actual mass of the extension product and not on a fluorescent molecule. This method is for low to medium high throughput, and is not intended for whole genome scanning.

The flexibility and specificity of primer extension make it amenable to high throughput analysis.  Primer extension probes can be arrayed on slides allowing for many SNPs to be genotyped at once. Broadly referred to as arrayed primer extension (APEX), this technology has several benefits over methods based on differential hybridization of probes.  Comparatively, APEX methods have greater discriminating power than methods using this differential hybridization, as it is often impossible to obtain the optimal hybridization conditions for the thousands of probes on DNA microarrays (usually this is addressed by having highly redundant probes). However, the same density of probes cannot be achieved in APEX methods, which translates into lower output per run.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;

'''Illumina''' Incorporated's '''Infinium''' assay is an example of a whole-genome genotyping pipeline that is based on primer extension method. In the Infinium assay, over 100,000 SNPs can be genotyped. The assay uses hapten-labelled nucleotides in a primer extension reaction.  The hapten label is recognized by anti-bodies, which in turn are coupled to a detectable signal (Gunderson et al. 2006).

'''[[APEX-2]]''' is an arrayed primer extension genotyping method which is able to identify hundreds of SNPs or mutations in parallel using efficient homogeneous [[multiplex PCR]] (up to 640-plex) and four-color single-base extension on a microarray. The multiplex PCR requires two oligonucleotides per SNP/mutation generating amplicons that contain the tested base pair. The same oligonucleotides are used in the following step as immobilized single-base extension primers on a microarray (Krjutskov et al. 2008).

===5’- nuclease===
Taq DNA polymerase's 5’-nuclease activity is used in the '''[[TaqMan]]''' assay for SNP genotyping.  The '''TaqMan''' assay is performed concurrently with a PCR reaction and the results can be read in real-time as the PCR reaction proceeds (McGuigan &amp; Ralston 2002).  The assay requires forward and reverse PCR primers that will amplify a region that includes the SNP polymorphic site. Allele discrimination is achieved using [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] combined with one or two allele-specific probes that hybridize to the SNP polymorphic site.  The probes will have a fluorophore linked to their 5’ end and a quencher molecule linked to their 3’ end.  While the probe is intact, the quencher will remain in close proximity to the fluorophore, eliminating the fluorophore's signal. During the PCR amplification step, if the allele-specific probe is perfectly complementary to the SNP allele, it will bind to the target DNA strand and then get degraded by 5’-nuclease activity of the Taq polymerase as it extends the DNA from the PCR primers.  The degradation of the probe results in the separation of the fluorophore from the quencher molecule, generating a detectable signal.  If the allele-specific probe is not perfectly complementary, it will have lower melting temperature and not bind as efficiently.  This prevents the nuclease from acting on the probe (McGuigan &amp; Ralston 2002).

Since the '''TaqMan''' assay is based on PCR, it is relatively simple to implement. The '''TaqMan''' assay can be multiplexed by combining the detection of up to seven SNPs in one reaction.  However, since each SNP requires a distinct probe, the '''TaqMan''' assay is limited by the how close the SNPs can be situated. The scale of the assay can be drastically increased by performing many simultaneous reactions in microtitre plates.  Generally, '''TaqMan''' is limited to applications that involve interrogating a small number of SNPs since optimal probes and reaction conditions must be designed for each SNP (Syvanen 2001).

===Oligonucleotide Ligation Assay===
DNA ligase catalyzes the ligation of the 3' end of a DNA fragment to the 5' end of a directly adjacent DNA fragment.  This mechanism can be used to interrogate a SNP by hybridizing two probes directly over the SNP polymorphic site, whereby ligation can occur if the probes are identical to the target DNA.  In the oligonucleotide ligase assay, two probes are designed; an allele-specific probe which hybridizes to the target DNA so that its 3' base is situated directly over the SNP nucleotide and a second probe that hybridizes the template upstream (downstream in the complementary strand) of the SNP polymorphic site providing a 5' end for the ligation reaction. If the allele-specific probe matches the target DNA, it will fully hybridize to the target DNA and ligation can occur. Ligation does not generally occur in the presence of a mismatched 3' base. Ligated or unligated products can be detected by gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or by capillary electrophoresis for large-scale applications.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;  With appropriate sequences and tags on the oligonucleotides, high-throughput sequence  data can be generated from the ligated products and genotypes determined (Curry et al., 2012).  The use of large numbers of sample indexes allows high-throughput sequence data on hundreds of SNPs in thousands of samples to be generated in a small portion of a high-throughput sequencing run.  This is a massive genotyping by sequencing technology (MGST).{{cn|date=July 2022}}

==Other post-amplification methods based on physical properties of DNA==

The characteristic DNA properties of melting temperature and single stranded conformation have been used in several applications to distinguish SNP alleles.  These methods very often achieve high specificity but require highly optimized conditions to obtain the best possible results.

===Single strand conformation polymorphism===
{{main|Single_strand_conformation_polymorphism}}
Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) folds into a tertiary structure.  The conformation is sequence dependent and most single base pair mutations will alter the shape of the structure.  When applied to a gel, the tertiary shape will determine the mobility of the ssDNA, providing a mechanism to differentiate between SNP alleles. This method first involves PCR amplification of the target DNA.  The double-stranded PCR products are denatured using heat and formaldehyde to produce ssDNA.  The ssDNA is applied to a non-denaturing electrophoresis gel and allowed to fold into a tertiary structure.  Differences in DNA sequence will alter the tertiary conformation and be detected as a difference in the ssDNA strand mobility (Costabile et al. 2006). This method is widely used because it is technically simple, relatively inexpensive and uses commonly available equipment. However compared to other SNP genotyping methods, the sensitivity of this assay is lower.  It has been found that the ssDNA conformation is highly dependent on temperature and it is not generally apparent what the ideal temperature is.  Very often the assay will be carried out using several different temperatures.  There is also a restriction on the length of fragment because the sensitivity drops when sequences longer than 400 bp are used (Costabile et al. 2006).

===Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis===
[[Image:SNP-DHPLC-TGGE-1updated.jpg|right|thumbnail]]
The [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]] (TGGE) or temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis (TGCE) method is based on the principle that partially denatured DNA is more restricted and travels slower in a porous material such as a gel.  This property allows for the separation of DNA by melting temperature.  To adapt these methods for SNP detection, two fragments are used; the target DNA which contain the SNP polymorphic site being interrogated and an allele-specific DNA sequence, referred to as the normal DNA fragment. The normal fragment is identical to the target DNA except potentially at the SNP polymorphic site, which is unknown in the target DNA.  The fragments are denatured and then reannealed.  If the target DNA has the same allele as the normal fragment, homoduplexes will form that will have the same melting temperature.  When run on the gel with a temperature gradient, only one band will appear.  If the target DNA has a distinct allele, four products will form following the reannealing step; homoduplexes consisting of  target DNA, homoduplexes consisting of normal DNA and two heterduplexes of each strand of target DNA hybridized with the normal DNA strand.  These four products will have distinct melting temperatures and will appear as four bands in the denaturing gel.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;

===Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography===
[[Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography]] (DHPLC) uses reversed-phase [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] to interrogate SNPs. The key to DHPLC is the solid phase which has differential affinity for single and double-stranded DNA. In DHPLC, DNA fragments are denatured by heating and then allowed to reanneal. The melting temperature of the reannealed DNA fragments determines the length of time they are retained in the column.&lt;ref name=Oefner1995/&gt; Using PCR, two fragments are generated; target DNA containing the SNP polymorphic site and an allele-specific DNA sequence, referred to as the normal DNA fragment.  This normal fragment is identical to the target DNA except potentially at the SNP polymorphic site, which is unknown in the target DNA.  The fragments are denatured and then allowed to gradually reanneal. The reannaled products are added to the DHPLC column. If the SNP allele in the target DNA matches the normal DNA fragment, only identical homoduplexes will form during the reannealing step.  If the target DNA contains a different SNP allele than the normal DNA fragment, heteroduplexes of the target DNA and normal DNA containing a mismatched polymorphic site will form in addition to homoduplexes. The mismatched heteroduplexes will have a different melting temperature than the homoduplexes and will not be retained in the column as long.  This generates a chromatograph pattern that is distinctive from the pattern that would be generated if the target DNA fragment and normal DNA fragments were identical.  The eluted DNA is detected by UV absorption.&lt;ref name=Oefner1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oefner PJ, Underhill PA | title = Comparative DNA sequencing by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 57 | pages = 103–10 | date = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DHPLC is easily automated as no labeling or purification of the DNA fragments is needed.  The method is also relatively fast and has a high specificity.  One major drawback of DHPLC is that the column temperature must be optimized for each target in order to achieve the right degree of denaturation.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;

===High-resolution melting of the entire amplicon===
[[High Resolution Melt|High Resolution Melting analysis]] is the simplest PCR-based method to understand.  Basically, the same thermodynamic properties that allowed for the gel techniques to work apply here, and in real-time.  A fluorimeter monitors the post-PCR denaturation of the entire dsDNA amplicon.  You make primers specific to the site you want to amplify.  You "paint" the amplicon with a double-strand specific dye, included in the PCR mix.  The ds-specific dye integrates itself into the PCR product.  In essence, the entire amplicon becomes a probe.  This opens up new possibilities for discovery.  Either you position the primers very close to either side of the SNP in question (small amplicon genotyping, Liew, 2004) or amplify a larger region (100-400bp in length) for scanning purposes.  For simple genotyping of an SNP, it is easier to just make the amplicon small to minimize the chances you mistake one SNP for another.  The melting temperature (Tm) of the entire amplicon is determined and most homozygotes are sufficiently different (in the better instruments) in Tm to genotype.  Heterozygotes are even easier to differentiate because they have heteroduplexes generated (refer to the gel-based explanations) which broadens the melt transition and usually gives two discernible peaks.  Amplicon melting using a fluorescently-labeled primer has been described (Gundry et al., 2003) but is less practical than using ds-specific dyes due to the cost of the fluorogenic primer.

Scanning of larger amplicons is based on the same principles as outlined above.  However, melting temperature and the overall shape of the melting curve become informative. For amplicons &gt;c.150bp there are often &gt;2 melting peaks, each of which can vary, depending on the DNA template composition.  Numerous investigators have been able to successfully eliminate the majority of their sequencing through melt-based scanning, allowing accurate locus-based genotyping of large numbers of individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid22783911"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang XD, Kelleher CT, Howard-Williams E, Meade CV | title = Rapid identification of chloroplast haplotypes using High Resolution Melting analysis | journal = Molecular Ecology Resources | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 894–908 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22783911 | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-0998.2012.03164.x | s2cid = 8384592 | url = http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/10932/1/CM-Rapid-2012.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many investigators have found scanning for mutations using high resolution melting as a viable and practical way to study entire genes.

===Use of DNA mismatch-binding proteins===

DNA mismatch-binding proteins can distinguish single nucleotide mismatches and thus facilitate differential analysis of SNPs. For example, MutS protein from ''Thermus aquaticus'' binds different single nucleotide mismatches with different affinities and can be used in capillary electrophoresis to differentiate all six sets of mismatches (Drabovich &amp; Krylov 2006).

===SNPlex===
{{main|SNPlex}}
SNPlex is a proprietary genotyping platform sold by [[Applied Biosystems]].

===Surveyor nuclease assay===
{{main|Surveyor_nuclease_assay}}
Surveyor nuclease is a mismatch endonuclease enzyme that recognizes all base substitutions and small insertions/deletions (indels), and cleaves the 3′ side of mismatched sites in both DNA strands.

==Sequencing==
{{further|SNV calling from NGS data}}
[[Next-generation sequencing]] technologies such as [[pyrosequencing]] sequence less than 250 bases in a read which limits their ability to sequence whole genomes. However, their ability to generate results in real-time and their potential to be massively scaled up makes them a viable option for sequencing small regions to perform SNP genotyping.  Compared to other SNP genotyping methods, sequencing is in particular, suited to identifying multiple SNPs in a small region, such as the highly polymorphic [[Major Histocompatibility Complex]] region of the genome.&lt;ref name=Rapley2004/&gt;

'''''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''''' is a book on human [[kinship]] and social behavior by Maximilian Holland, published in 2012. The work synthesizes the perspectives of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]] towards understanding human social bonding and cooperative behavior. It presents a theoretical treatment that many consider to have resolved longstanding questions about the proper place of genetic (or 'blood') connections in human kinship and social relations, and a synthesis that ''"should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology"''.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Philip Kitcher comment (book cover), see https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been called ''"A landmark in the field of evolutionary biology"''&lt;ref name=AV2014&gt;{{cite journal | first = Augusto | last = Vitale | title = Review of ''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship'' | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 85 | year = 2014 | pages = 215 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/365178 | doi=10.1159/000365178| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"'',&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover), see https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; ''"places genetic determinism in the correct perspective"''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt; and serves as ''"a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries."''&lt;ref name=SS2015&gt;{{cite journal | first = Stuart | last = Semple| title = Review of: Holland, M (2012) Social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches. | journal = Acta Ethologica | volume = 19| year = 2016| pages = 101–102| doi = 10.1007/s10211-015-0225-9| s2cid = 6731583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the book is to show that ''"properly interpreted,  cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data)  and biological approaches are perfectly compatible regarding processes of social bonding in humans."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Pages 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's position is based on demonstrating that the dominant biological theory of social behavior ([[inclusive fitness]] theory) is typically misunderstood to predict that genetic ties are necessary for the ''expression'' of social behaviors, whereas in fact the theory only implicates genetic associations as necessary for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. Whilst rigorous evolutionary biologists have long understood the distinction between these levels of analysis (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]), past attempts to apply inclusive fitness theory to humans have often overlooked the distinction between ''evolution'' and ''expression''.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its central argument, the broader philosophical implications of Holland's work are considered by commentators to be that it both ''"helps to untangle a long-standing disciplinary muddle"''&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt; and ''"clarifies the relationship between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship."''&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hrdy comment (book description), see https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that the book ''"demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs"''&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book description), see https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consequence, delivers ''"a convincing, solid and informed blow to the residual genetic determinism that still influences the interpretation of social behaviour."''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book's form consists of a cumulative argument (using a wide range of supporting evidence) made over nine chapters, with each chapter ending in a brief retrospective summary, and the final chapter containing a recapitulation and summary of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;This synopsis is based mainly on the book's chapter summaries and concluding chapter&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing some wider conclusions.

===Continuing debate over 'blood kinship'===
{{See also|Kinship}}

Holland begins by tracing transitions in the history of anthropological theories of social behavior and [[kinship]], noting the varying importance with which 'blood ties' have been understood to be a necessary element of human kinship and social relations. He suggests that whilst the mounting [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence has led to a move away from the 'blood kinship' concept in recent decades, many sociocultural anthropologists still query the connection between kinship and blood, reproduction or some other apparently biological functions. Meanwhile, many biologists, [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have persisted in viewing human kinship and cooperative behavior as necessarily associated with genetic relationships and 'blood ties'. The current situation has been characterized as "''a clash between incommensurate paradigms, holding as they may, completely incompatible ideas about human nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thomas comment (book cover), see https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; Holland argues that a clear resolution to these questions is still outstanding, and would therefore be of value. In closing the introduction, Holland writes; "The approach  is not reductive. The claim is rather that a thorough investigation of the ‘biological facts’ can be useful mainly though allowing a change in focus... away from confusion about the place of genealogy in social ties, and onto a reformulated baseline, built around varied ''processual aspects of social bonding.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology theory of social behavior===
{{See also|Inclusive fitness}}

The book reviews the background and key elements of [[W.D.Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[inclusive fitness]] theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964)&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1964. The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7:1-52. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (''supergenes''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt; as a possible alternative to ''behaviour-evoking-situations''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt;) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the supergenes notion (sometimes called the ''[[Green-beard effect]]'') - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the intervening years, the notion that supergenes (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved ''to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them'' took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.

Holland shows that, in the 1970s and 80s, the first wave of attempts (known as ''human [[sociobiology]]'' or ''[[Darwinian anthropology]]'') to apply inclusive fitness theory to human social behavior relied on, and further reinforced, this same misinterpretation (above section) about the theory's predictions and the proximate mechanisms of social behavior. Holland also shows that this period of research was burdened with many misplaced assumptions about ''universal'' attributes of the human sexes, [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] roles, apparently projected from the ''specific cultural values'' of the researchers themselves. Holland also shows that, following the perceived failures of this early wave, and particularly its methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms of social behavior, the [[evolutionary psychology]] school grew up in its place. Although this latter school typically avoided engaging with the ethnographic data on human kinship, Holland argues that in the few cases where it did so, it repeated the misinterpretation of inclusive fitness theory that characterized the first wave. Holland also notes that [[Philip Kitcher|Kitcher]], in his&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip. 1985. Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 1985 critique of the sociobiological position, suggested that perhaps the expression of social behaviors in humans might quite simply be based on cues of context and familiarity, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.

===Proximate mechanisms and 'kin recognition'===
{{See also| Kin recognition}}

Chapters four and five investigate further the theory and evidence surrounding the ''proximate mechanisms'' of social behavior; specifically the question of whether social behaviors are expressed by organisms via ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' or via direct detection of actual genetic relatedness. Related questions have been the domain of [[kin recognition]] theory. Holland notes that the name 'kin recognition' itself suggests some expectation that a positive identification of genetic relatedness is a prediction of inclusive fitness theory, and is thus expected. Similar points have been made by others; "many behavioural ecologists seem to implicitly assume that specialised mechanisms allowing individuals to distinguish their kin from non-kin must have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Z. 2001. The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation. Behavioural Processes 53:21-40. Page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. 1990. Do animals really recognize kin? Animal Behaviour 39:42-54.&lt;/ref&gt;" Again, the possibility that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' might be the more parsimonious&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. On page 420, Hamilton clearly states that ''"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.''"&lt;/ref&gt; mechanism of the expression of social behavior, and fully compatible with inclusive fitness theory, has often been underemphasized. However, Holland's review of the evidence notes that field studies in this area quickly established that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' do in fact overwhelmingly mediate social behaviours in those species studied, and that, particularly in mammal species, social bonding and familiarity formed in early developmental contexts (e.g. in burrows or nesting sites) are a common mediating mechanism for social behaviors, independently of genetic relatedness ''per se''. On the basis of the preceding theoretical analysis and review of evidence, at the end of chapter five, Holland argues that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely erroneous, both in reference to theory and in reference to the evidence, to claim or suggest that 'the facts of biology' support the claim that organisms have evolved to cooperate with genetic relatives ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Primate social bonding and attachment theory===
{{See also| Attachment theory}}

Having argued for the above position on the lack of necessity for genetic relatedness ''per se'' to mediate social bonding and behavior, Holland suggests that "The further question then is; can we uncover in any greater detail how familiarity and other context-dependent cues operate?".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; To discover the extent to which the variety of human kinship behaviors may nevertheless be compatible with this (less deterministic) interpretation of biological theory of social behavior, Holland suggests that a survey of [[primate|primates']] most fundamental social patterns may give clues, especially those of species most closely connected with humans. The variety of primate [[mating system]]s, group-membership ('[[philopatry]]') patterns, and life-cycle patterns are reviewed. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other mammals, Catarrhini primate demographics are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, particularly density and distribution of food sources... Cohesive social groups and delayed natal dispersal mean that maternally related individuals, including maternal siblings, face a statistically reliable context of interaction in all Catarrhini primates. This reliable context of interaction with maternally related individuals is extended amongst those species with female philopatry (especially Cercopithecinae).&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with other social mammals, evidence suggest that the reliability of 'behaviour-evoking-situations' this social context provides has shaped the mechanisms of proximate expression of social bonding and behavior;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of infants by females (and sometimes males) demonstrates that care-giving and bonding to infants is not mediated by positive powers of discrimination. From the infant's perspective, it will bond with any responsive carer. If not necessarily the actual mother, in natural conditions this will often be a maternal relative (particularly an older sibling), but the context is primary, not the actual relatedness. Similarly, social bonding and social behaviours between maternal siblings (and occasionally between other maternal relatives) is context-driven in primates, and mediated via the care-giver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holland also notes how [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] and colleagues' [[attachment theory]] was strongly informed by primate bonding patterns and mechanisms, and that in Bowlby's later writing the then emerging [[inclusive fitness]] theory was explicitly linked to. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bowlby's] work demonstrated that social attachments form on the basis of provision of care, and responsiveness to elicitations for care. The social context of living together and the familiarity this brings, provides the circumstance within which social bonds can form...&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the basis of combining more recent primate research with the findings of attachment theory, Holland proposes that "In attempting to define more specific forms of ''the giving of care and nurture'' which may mediate social bonding we [find] that provision of food is likely to play a part, as well as the more intangible provision of warmth and comfort, and a safe base for sleeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;"

===Processual and nurture kinship in humans===
{{See also|Nurture kinship}}

Holland claims that, while biological theory of social behavior is not [[determinism|deterministic]] in respect of genetic relatedness vis-a-vis the formation of social bonds and expression of social behaviors, evidence does point to compatibility between a [[reductionism|non-reductive]] interpretation of the theory and how such bonds and behaviors operate in social mammals, primates and in humans. In the final part of the book, Holland explores the extent to which this perspective is also compatible with sociocultural anthropology's ethnographic accounts of human kinship and social behavior, both occasional accounts from the past, as well as more contemporary accounts that have explicitly eschewed the earlier 'blood ties' assumption. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many contemporary accounts focus on social bonds formed in childhood and the importance of the performance of acts of care, including food provision, in mediating these bonds. In all cases it is this performance of care which is considered the overriding factor in
mediating social bonds, notwithstanding 'blood ties'. In short, there is strong compatibility between the perspectives on social bonding that emerge from a proper account of biological theory and those documented by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conclusion===

Holland's concluding chapter gives a summary of his fundamental position;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crucial implication of this argument taken as a whole is that ''the expression of the kinds of social behaviours treated by inclusive fitness theory does not require genetic relatedness.'' Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology's claims that biological science predicts that organisms ''will'' direct social behaviour towards relatives are thus both ''theoretically'' and ''empirically'' erroneous. Such claims and their supporting arguments also give a highly misleading and reductive account of basic biological theory. Properly interpreted, ''cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data) and biological approaches are perfectly compatible'' regarding processes of social bonding in humans. Most of all, this requires a focus on the circumstances and processes which lead to social bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book notes that, as an outcome of the analysis, [[David M. Schneider|Schneider's]] sociocultural perspective on human kinship is vindicated;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do the biological facts have some priority or are they but one of the conditions, like ecology, economy, demography, etc., to which kinship systems must adapt? Take note: if the latter is the case, then kinship must be as much rooted in these other conditions as in the biological facts.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, David M. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author supplies several examples of the insight that Schneider's broad approach can provide. The book closes with an example of a clash of cultural perspectives on kinship and family norms, and makes the suggestion that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Constructing from narrow cultural particulars (Euro-American or otherwise) an essentialised model of 'human nature' does not constitute science; it is closer to cultural colonialism. In any analysis intended to shed light on proposed universals of the human condition, reflexivity is essential, and cultural and biological approaches both surely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and reviews==

===General===
Kinship theorist and member of the [[US National Academy of Sciences]], [[Robin Fox]] wrote of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An excellent and constructive discussion of matters in kinship and its cultural and biological components, handsomely reconciling what have been held to be incompatible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fox commentary, Fox's Website, http://robin-fox.com/books.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Holland gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior. If he had been in the debate in the 1980s then a lot of subsequent confusion could have been avoided"&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irwin Bernstein, distinguished research professor in the university of Georgia's ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences Program'' made the following comment on Holland's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has demonstrated extraordinarily thorough scholarship in his exhaustive review of the often contentious discussions of kinship.  He has produced a balanced synthesis melding the two approaches exemplified in the biological and sociocultural behavioral positions. His work in reconciling opposing views clearly demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary approaches.  This should be the definitive word on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Bernstein comment (book cover), see https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]], John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, and James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization at [[Columbia University]], past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and inaugural winner of the Prometheus Prize, stated of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has provided a wide-ranging and deeply-probing analysis of the influence of genetic relatedness and social context on human kinship. He argues that while genetic relatedness may play a role in the evolution of social behavior, it does not determine the forms of such behavior. His discussion is exemplary for its thoroughness, and should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sociocultural anthropology===
Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of [[anthropology]] at the university of Dartmouth, wrote that Holland's book was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant discussion of the relationship between kinship and social bonding as understood in evolutionary biology and in sociocultural anthropology. Among other contributions, it debunks the common misconception that biological evolution involves individual organisms actively pursuing the goal of increasing the numbers of their genes in successive generations, the measure of their so-called ‘individual inclusive fitness’. Holland demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book cover), see https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janet Carsten, kinship theorist and professor of anthropology at the university of Edinburgh stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is a scholarly attempt to get beyond the often sterile oppositions between evolutionary and culturalist approaches to kinship. In bringing together two sides of the debate, it constitutes a valuable contribution to kinship studies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Carsten comment, Author's website, see https://maximilianholland.com/2013/04/25/social-bonding-and-nurture-kinship-synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for the journal [[Critique of Anthropology]], Nicholas Malone concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lucid and effective... Holland has produced a significant work of scholarship that will be of interest to a wide swath of the anthropological community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Malone Review, Critique of Anthropology, {{doi|10.1177/0308275X15594535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the book for the journal [[Social Analysis]], Anni Kajanus found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holland has done an excellent and thorough job in reviewing the disciplinary and interdisciplinary histories of approaches to kinship and social bonds in anthropology, biology, and psychology. Most importantly, he clarifies the different levels of analysis when looking at human behavior in real time and in the evolutionary time frame. This makes the book essential reading for anyone who acknowledges that human relatedness and social bonds are shaped by the
evolved dispositions of our species, their development through the life-course of an individual, and our specific cultural-historical environments... Holland’s book goes a long way toward clarifying and therefore advancing these theoretical debates&lt;ref&gt;Anni Kajanus Review, Social Analysis, web: http://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/social-analysis/60/3/sa600308.xml, DOI: 10.3167/sa.2016.600308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biology===
An in-depth review of the book by [[primatology|primatologist]] Augusto Vitale, in the journal ''[[Folia Primatologica]]'', found that:
                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;blockquote&gt;This is, without a doubt, a very significant and important contribution to the on-going discussion about the determinants of sociality in humans as well as in other animals... A painstaking analysis of inclusive fitness, attachment theory and non-human primate social relationships, through a fascinating journey which ends with an anthropological account of social bonds in different cultures... It is a landmark in the field of evolutionary biology, which places genetic determinism in the correct perspective.&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart Semple, evolutionary anthropologist, reviewing the book in the journal ''[[Acta Ethologica]]'' stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As someone who teaches behavioural ecology to biologists, and primate biology to social and biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, as well as to my colleagues. Not only does it help to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.&lt;ref name=SS2015 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Published debate and criticism of the book==
{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=September 2014}}

In addition to praise for the book's significance, the [[Folia Primatologica]] review noted that the book is at times too dense and requires close reading;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument here and there becomes too detailed and tortuous, but it is absolutely captivating... [Colleagues] who are less used to extremely detailed theoretical reasoning, will find it difficult at the beginning...&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Eugenics in America|state=collapsed}}{{More citations needed|date=May 2022}}
The '''Society for Biodemography and Social Biology''', formerly known as the '''Society for the Study of Social Biology''' and before then as the '''American Eugenics Society''',&lt;ref name = "springer"&gt;Eugenics, Encyclopedia of Critical Psychology, (2014, pp 619-626) {{ISBN|978-1-4614-5583-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dedicated to "furthering the discussion, advancement, and dissemination of knowledge about biological and sociocultural forces which affect the structure and composition of human populations."&lt;ref&gt;The Society for Biodemography and Social Biology, Homepage (Last retrieved Nov 26, 2014)http://www.biodemog.org {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130414073645/http://www.biodemog.org/ |date=2013-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Society formed after the success of the [[International Eugenics Conference|Second International Congress on Eugenics]] ([[New York City|New York]], 1921). The founders included [[Madison Grant]], [[Harry H. Laughlin]], [[Irving Fisher]], [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], and [[Henry Crampton]]. The organization started by promoting racial betterment, eugenic health, and genetic education through public lectures, exhibits at county fairs, etc.

In 1926, the society published a ''Eugenics Catechism'', arguing that eugenics was supported by the Bible, and therefore ought to be promoted by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baker |first=G. J. |date=2014-04-08 |title=Christianity and Eugenics: The Place of Religion in the British Eugenics Education Society and the American Eugenics Society, c.1907-1940 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/shm/hku008 |journal=Social History of Medicine |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=281–302 |doi=10.1093/shm/hku008 |issn=0951-631X |pmc=4001825 |pmid=24778464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=John P. |last2=Weidman |first2=Nadine M. |date=2005 |title=The Origins of Scientific Racism |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25073379 |journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education |issue=50 |pages=66–79 |jstor=25073379 |issn=1077-3711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of [[Frederick Osborn]] the society started to place greater focus on issues of population control, genetics, and, later, medical genetics.  In 1930, the Society included mostly prominent and wealthy individuals, and membership included many non-scientists.  The demographics of the Society gradually changed, and by 1960, members of the Society were almost exclusively scientist and medical professionals.  Consequentially, the society focused more on genetics and less on [[Class discrimination|class]]-based [[eugenics]].&lt;ref name="aes" /&gt;

After the [[Roe v. Wade]] decision was released in 1973, the Society was reorganized and renamed  The Society for the Study of Social Biology.&lt;ref name="aes"&gt;American Eugenics Society, [https://library.missouri.edu/exhibits/eugenics/aes.htm Controlling Heredity].&lt;/ref&gt; Osborn said, "The name was changed because it became evident that changes of a eugenic nature would be made for reasons other than eugenics, and that tying a eugenic label on them would more often hinder than help,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=15856597 | title=The Long Road of Eugenics: From Rockefeller to Roe v. Wade | author=Messall, Rebecca | journal=The Human Life Review |date=Fall 2004 | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=33–74, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Organized eugenics: January 1931 | author=American Eugenics Society, Inc. | year=1931 | pages=3, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was most recently changed to Society for Biodemography and Social Biology.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

==Journal==
The Society's official journal is ''[[Biodemography and Social Biology]]'', which was originally established in 1954 as ''Eugenics Quarterly''. It was renamed to ''Social Biology'' in 1969 and to its current title in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/hsbi20 |title=Biodemography and Social Biology Publication History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine''' (abbreviated '''SEBM''') is a nonprofit scientific society dedicated to promoting research in the [[biomedical science]]s.

==Founding==
The SEBM was founded in 1903, after [[Samuel J. Meltzer]] proposed founding a society dedicated to experimental biology and medicine. Meltzer then teamed up with [[Graham Lusk]] to invite eight [[New York (state)|New York]] scientists to a conference at Lusk's home, where they discussed the possibility of founding a biomedical society. At the conference, the attendees uniformly agreed to appoint a committee for a permanent society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWISAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA7 |title=Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=1921 |publisher=Blackwell Science |pages=7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gies |first=William J. |date=1903-03-20 |title=The Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine |journal=Science |language=en |volume=17 |issue=429 |pages=468–469 |doi=10.1126/science.17.429.468-a |issn=0036-8075|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1447876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journal==
The SEBM's official journal is ''[[Experimental Biology and Medicine (Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine journal)|Experimental Biology and Medicine]]'', published by [[SAGE Publications]]. It was founded in 1904 as the ''Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine'', and obtained its current name in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/003523165 |title=Experimental biology and medicine |last=Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine (New York, N.Y.) |date=2001 |pages=v |access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Sociobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that aims to examine and explain [[social behavior]] in terms of [[evolution]]. It draws from disciplines including [[psychology]], [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], and [[population genetics]]. Within the study of human [[society|societies]], sociobiology is closely allied to [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[human behavioral ecology]], [[evolutionary psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Wilson, Edward O.|author-link=Edward O. Wilson|title=The Social Insects|date=2000-03-24|work=Sociobiology|pages=397–437|publisher=Harvard University Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctvjnrttd.22|isbn=978-0-674-74416-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=François|date=1994|title=Sociobiology and Sociology|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.so.20.080194.001411|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=267–303|doi=10.1146/annurev.so.20.080194.001411|issn=0360-0572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Sousa|first=Ronald|date=1990-01-01|title=The sociology of sociobiology|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/02698599008573367|journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=4|issue=3|pages=271–283|doi=10.1080/02698599008573367|issn=0269-8595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as [[mating system|mating patterns]], [[territoriality|territorial fights]], [[pack hunter|pack hunting]], and the hive society of [[social insect]]s. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the [[natural environment]], so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Daniel G.|date=January 1985|title=Sociobiology and the human dimension|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=121–122|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(85)90006-8|issn=0162-3095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s, the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of [[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of [[scientific controversy|controversy]].  Critics, led by [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as [[aggressiveness]]  could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between [[nature and nurture]].

==Definition==

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, E. O. |author-link=E. O. Wilson |year=1978 |title=On Human Nature |url=https://archive.org/details/onhumannature00wils |url-access=registration |page=x |publisher=Harvard |isbn=978-0674016385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mohammed |first1=Sulma I. |last2=Alfarouk |first2=Khalid O. |last3=Elhassan |first3=Ahmed M. |last4=Hamad |first4=Kamal |last5=Ibrahim |first5=Muntaser E. |title=The Genetics of African Populations in Health and Disease |chapter=Sociobiological Transition and Cancer |date=2019 |pages=217–232 |doi=10.1017/9781139680295.010 |isbn=9781139680295 |s2cid=214321882 |chapter-url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/genetics-of-african-populations-in-health-and-disease/sociobiological-transition-and-cancer/E4FE8995823F33510961E6FDF1293F38 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be [[Heredity|inherited]] from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking The Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology | author1=Wilson, David Sloan  |author2=Wilson, Edward O. |author1-link=David Sloan Wilson|author2-link=E. O. Wilson | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=2007 | volume=82 | issue=4 | pages=327–348 | doi=10.1086/522809 | pmid=18217526| s2cid=37774648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This [[adaptive behavior|behavior is adaptive]] because killing the cubs eliminates [[competition (biology)|competition]] for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Packer |first1=Craig |last2=Pusey |first2=Anne E. |title=Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males |journal=Am.

==History==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|upright|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]], a central figure in the history of sociobiology, from the publication in 1975 of his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'']]

The philosopher of biology [[Daniel Dennett]] suggested that the political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first proto-sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |author-link=Daniel Dennett |title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea |url=https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn |url-access=registration |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn/page/453 453–454] |isbn=978-0140167344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geneticist of animal behavior [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]] coined the word ''sociobiology'' at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life of J.P. Scott |url=https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/neuroscience/john-paul-scott/the-life-of-jp-scott.html |publisher=Bowling Green State University |access-date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a  "Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology" of the Ecological Society of America was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, [[E. O. Wilson]] came in contact with this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a "sociobiologist" at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.
Wilson's sociobiology is different from [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]]'s or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximisation of the genetic fitness by [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[John Maynard Smith]], and [[George R. Price]]. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when "biology in the field" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by "modern" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).&lt;ref name=Dobzhansky1966&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=Theodosius |title=Are Naturalists Old-Fashioned? |journal=The American Naturalist |date=September 1966 |volume=100 |issue=915 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1086/282448|s2cid=129104506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a specialist term, "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'', which sparked an intense controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilson's vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other [[Hymenoptera]], but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book, ''[[On Human Nature]]'', that addressed human behavior specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Walsh, Bryan | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/on-human-nature-by-edward-o-wilson/ | title=All-Time 100 Nonfiction Books | magazine=Time |date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Psychology 2005"&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Sociobiologists maintain that [[Human nature|human behavior]], as well as nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.

[[Natural selection]] is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be "selected for". Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an [[organism]] a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman [[Species |animal species]] has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it has become a foundation of [[evolutionary biology]]. However, there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.

[[File:Nikolaas Tinbergen 1978.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], whose work influenced sociobiology]]

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore, these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions |four categories of questions]] and explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called "ultimate explanations") are
* the function (i.e., [[adaptation]]) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e., [[phylogeny]]) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
* the development of the individual (i.e., [[ontogeny]]) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g., [[brain anatomy]] and [[hormone]]s).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in [[instinct]]ive, or [[Intuition (knowledge) |intuitive]] behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of [[mammals]] – including humans – are very protective of their [[offspring]]. Sociobiologists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral [[adaptation]]s, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.

Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon [[social group |groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1975. Chapter 5. "Group Selection and Altruism"&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms responsible for [[group selection]] employ [[paradigms]] and population statistics borrowed from [[evolutionary game theory]]. Altruism is defined as "a concern for the welfare of others". If altruism is genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tessman |first=Irwin |title=Human altruism as a courtship display |journal=Forum |year=1995 |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological [[hypothesis]] by finding an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy, and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between [[social insect]]s and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist, in some animals has been correlated to the degree of [[genome]] shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of [[infanticide]] by male harem-mating animals when the [[alpha male]] is displaced as well as [[rodent]] female infanticide and [[fetal resorption]] are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the [[food]] and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an [[ecological]] balance. Just as an expansion of a [[sheep]] population might encourage the expansion of a [[wolf]] population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and [[Intelligence quotient |IQ]] have high [[heritability]]. The researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=E. |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas |year=2009 |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217–220 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20%282009%29.pdf |access-date=29 June 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmc=2899491 |pmid=20625474 |quote=Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turkheimer |first=Eric |date=April 2008 |title=A Better Way to Use Twins for Developmental Research |journal=LIFE Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–5 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20%282008%29.pdf |access-date=29 October 2010 |quote=But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. . . . Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn't an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various theorists have argued that in some environments [[Crime |criminal behavior]] might be adaptive.&lt;ref name="mealy1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mealey |first1=Linda |title=The Sociobiology of Sociopathy: An Integrated Evolutionary Model |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=1995 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=523–541 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00039595 |s2cid=53956461 |url=http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026131543/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |access-date=27 October 2020 |archive-date=2002-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory |evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory]], by sociologist/criminologist [[Lee Ellis]], posits that female sexual selection has led to increased competitive behavior among men, sometimes resulting in criminality. In another theory, [[Mark van Vugt]] argues that a history of intergroup conflict for resources between men have led to differences in violence and aggression between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hernán |first1=Roberto |title=Gender Differences in Cooperation and Competition |date=2015 |work=Experimental Economics: Volume 1: Economic Decisions |pages=154–168 |editor-last=Branas-Garza |editor-first=Pablo |place=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |language=en |doi=10.1057/9781137538192_10 |isbn=978-1-137-53819-2 |last2=Kujal |first2=Praveen |editor2-last=Cabrales |editor2-first=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Elias Canetti]] also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Canetti]], ''[[Crowds and Power]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1981, pp. 444–445.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for premise==
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For example, the [[transcription factor]] FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the [[serotonergic system]] in the brain, is required for normal [[aggression|aggressive]] and [[anxiety]]-like behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks TJ, Fyodorov DV, Wegman LJ, Lelutiu NB, Pehek EA, Yamamoto B, Silver J, Weeber EJ, Sweatt JD, Deneris ES.

[[Steven Pinker]] argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of [[biological determinism]],{{efn|Biological determinism was a right wing philosophy underlying the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinian]] and [[Eugenics#History|eugenics movements]] of the early 20th century, and [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|controversies in the history of intelligence testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505|pmid=11611452 |s2cid=29672121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} accusing among others [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven | author-link=Steven Pinker |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=149 |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 |quote=A surprising number of intellectuals, particularly on the left, do deny that there is such a thing as inborn talent, especially intelligence.

[[Noam Chomsky]] has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]], as reported by [[Ullica Segerstråle]], Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|p=205}} Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the "[[blank slate]]" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 ''[[Reflections on Language]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1975), ''Reflections on Language'':10. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, Noam]] (1995). [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 "Rollback, Part II."] ''Z Magazine'' 8 (Feb.): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ''ought'' to be, only what ''is'' the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought",&lt;ref name=lrk84/&gt; an instance of the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered anti-social, such as ethnic nepotism, is based on [[morality|moral]] assumptions, meaning that such opposition is not [[falsifiable]] by scientific advances.&lt;ref name=Pinker2002&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]] (2002).

      <text bytes="3787" xml:space="preserve">The '''Sociome''' is a concept used by scientists in [[Biology]] and [[Sociology]] referring to the dimensions of existence that are social. The term is also an indication of the convergence of [[systems biology]] and the study of society as a [[complex system]] that has begun to occur among early 21st Century scientists. Just as the ''phenome'' is typically thought of as the set of expressed phenotypes of an organism, the sociome can be thought of as the set of observed characteristics of societies. For example, while all societies consisting of humans might be thought of as having the potential to become [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[Social democracy|social democracies]], not all observed societies are egalitarian or social democracies. Thus, the sociome can also be thought of indirectly as an [[ideal type]] of the unrealized potential of any given organization of social beings.

== Origin of term ==
The first known usage of the term ''sociome'' was in 2001 by Daichi Kamiyama.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiyama D. (2001) Bioprobes and Genetics Reveal the Signal Integration that Initiates Dendrites in a Neuron in Vivo. Doctoral Dissertation. Tokyo University of Science.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been utilized by sociologist Adam Thomas Perzynski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chrp.org/directory/name/adam-perzynski/ | title=What is Quantum Code &amp; Why It's So Effective? }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two scientists differ in their usage. Kamiyama's study describes a new scientific "era of the sociome (Sociology[+ome])" characterized by the study of the social activities of molecules. This usage is an anthropomorphism of social behavior, wherein molecules are described as having the ability to socialize.  Perzynski's social scientific usage varies from this considerably. While [[Sociology]] is the study of society, behavior and social relationships, the sociome is the characterization and quantification of patterns, variables, activities, relationships and attributes across all societies that exist and can be studied. The suffix '''-ome''' has been used primarily in biology, as in [[genome]], [[proteome]], [[microbiome]], [[metabolome]] and [[phenome]]. Basu and colleagues have used the term ''sociome'' to refer to a sort of standardized approach to the characterization of geocoded social attributes (e.g. neighborhood level).&lt;ref&gt;Basu S, Bustamonte C &amp; Grusky. [https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/phs/documents/13.%20Latha%20Palaniappan_Disparities-1.pdf Disparities Global and Domestic].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Del Savio and colleagues discussed the blurring of the boundaries between disciplines, and increased enthusiasm for the ''sociome'' concept and its importance for research in social science, epigenetics and epidemiology, with cautionary advice about the risks rooted in the marred history of [[Sociobiology]]&lt;ref&gt;Del Savio L, Damjanovicova M &amp; Testa G. (2014). From social structure to gene regulation, and back to choice: some cautionary remarks on the epigenetic imaginary of the body&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other authors have referred to sociomics as the bidirectional interplay between the field of Science and Technology Studies and all other "-omics" fields.&lt;ref&gt;McNally R &amp; Glasner P. (2005). Sociomics: Upon opening the ‘Black Box’ of proteomics &amp; finding ourselves inside&lt;/ref&gt;

The -omics Wikipedia entry had previously listed sociome as a proposed new name for sociology, although it is unclear whether this has ever actually been proposed by any credible source. Still others have proposed that sociome is the object of study of [[Sociometry]].

===Humans===
The minimum physiological requirement for sodium is between 115 and 500 milligrams per day depending on sweating due to physical activity, and whether the person is adapted to the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Normal serum sodium levels are between approximately 135 and 145 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|mEq]]/liter (135 - 145&amp;nbsp;mmol/L). A serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L qualifies as [[hyponatremia]], which is considered severe when the serum sodium level is below 125 mEq/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hyponatremia/DS00974 |title=Hyponatremia |publisher=MayoClinic.com |access-date=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/242166-overview |title=Hyponatremia |publisher=Medscape |access-date=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[renin–angiotensin system]] and the [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] indirectly regulate the amount of [[signal transduction]] in the human [[central nervous system]], which depends on sodium ion motion across the nerve cell membrane, in all nerves. Sodium is thus important in [[neuron]] function and osmoregulation between cells and the [[extracellular fluid]]; the distribution of sodium ions are mediated in all animals by [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium–potassium pumps]], which are active transporter [[solute pump]]s, pumping ions against the gradient, and sodium-potassium channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology|year=1987|isbn=0-8053-1840-2|page=795|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium channels are known to be less selective in comparison to potassium channels. Sodium is the most prominent cation in extracellular fluid: in the 15 liters of [[extracellular fluid]] in a 70&amp;nbsp;kg human there is around 50&amp;nbsp;grams of sodium, 90% of the body's total sodium content.

Some potent [[neurotoxin]]s, such as [[batrachotoxin]], increase the sodium ion permeability of the [[cell membrane]]s in nerves and muscles, causing a massive and irreversible [[depolarization]] of the membranes with potentially fatal consequences. However, drugs with smaller effects on sodium ion motion in nerves may have diverse pharmacological effects that range from anti-depressant to anti-seizure actions.

===Other animals===
Since only some plants need sodium and those in small quantities, a completely [[plant-based diet]] will generally be very low in sodium.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} This requires some herbivores to obtain their sodium from [[mineral lick|salt licks]] and other mineral sources. The animal need for sodium is probably the reason for the highly conserved ability to [[taste]] the sodium ion as "salty." Receptors for the pure salty taste respond best to sodium; otherwise, the receptors respond only to a few other small monovalent cations (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and somewhat to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). The [[calcium]] ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) also tastes salty and sometimes bitter to some people but, like potassium, can trigger other tastes.

Sodium ions play a diverse and important role in many physiological processes, acting to regulate [[blood volume]], [[blood pressure]], [[osmotic pressure|osmotic equilibrium]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sodiumbreakup.heart.org/how_much_sodium_should_i_eat | title=How much sodium should I eat per day? | publisher=American Heart Association | date=2016 | access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[C4 plants]], sodium is a [[micronutrient]] that aids in metabolism, specifically in regeneration of [[phosphoenolpyruvic acid|phosphoenolpyruvate]] (involved in the biosynthesis of various aromatic compounds, and in [[carbon fixation]]) and synthesis of chlorophyll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kering|first=M.

== Function of sodium ions ==

Sodium is the primary [[cation]] (positively charged ion) in extracellular fluids in animals and humans. These fluids, such as blood plasma and extracellular fluids in other tissues, bathe cells and carry out transport functions for nutrients and wastes. Sodium is also the principal cation in seawater, although the concentration there is about 3.8 times what it is normally in extracellular body fluids.

=== Human water and salt balance ===

Although the system for maintaining optimal salt and water balance in the body is a complex one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; one of the primary ways in which the human body keeps track of loss of body water is that [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[hypothalamus]] sense a balance of sodium and water concentration in extracellular fluids. Relative loss of body water will cause sodium concentration to rise higher than normal, a condition known as [[hypernatremia]]. This ordinarily results in thirst. Conversely, an excess of body water caused by drinking will result in too little sodium in the blood ([[hyponatremia]]), a condition which is again sensed by the [[hypothalamus]], causing a decrease in [[vasopressin]] hormone secretion from the [[posterior pituitary]], and a consequent loss of water in the urine, which acts to restore blood sodium concentrations to normal.  

Severely dehydrated persons, such as people rescued from ocean or desert survival situations, usually have very high blood sodium concentrations. These must be very carefully and slowly returned to normal, since too-rapid correction of hypernatremia may result in brain damage from cellular swelling, as water moves suddenly into cells with high [[osmolar]] content.     
   
In humans, a high-salt intake was demonstrated to attenuate [[nitric oxide]] production. Nitric oxide (NO) contributes to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Relationship between Salt Intake, Nitric Oxide and Asymmetric Dimethylarginine and Its Relevance to Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease − |author1=Tomohiro Osanai |author2=Naoto Fujiwara |author3=Masayuki Saitoh |author4=Satoko Sasaki |author5=Hirofumi Tomita |author6=Masayuki Nakamura |author7=Hiroshi Osawa |author8=Hideaki Yamabe |author9=Ken Okumura | journal = Blood Purif | year = 2002 | volume = 20 |issue=5 | pages = 466–468 | doi = 10.1159/000063555 | pmid=12207094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urinary sodium===
Because the [[hypothalamus]]/[[osmoreceptor]] system ordinarily works well to cause drinking or urination to restore the body's sodium concentrations to normal, this system can be used in medical treatment to regulate the body's total fluid content, by first controlling the body's sodium content. Thus, when a powerful [[diuretic]] drug is given which causes the kidneys to excrete sodium, the effect is accompanied by an excretion of body water (water loss accompanies sodium loss). This happens because the kidney is unable to efficiently retain water while excreting large amounts of sodium. In addition, after sodium excretion, the [[osmoreceptor]] system may sense lowered sodium concentration in the blood and then direct compensatory urinary water loss in order to correct the [[hyponatremia|hyponatremic]] (low blood sodium) state.

'''Soft-bodied organisms''' are [[animal]]s that lack [[skeleton]]s. The group roughly corresponds to the group [[Vermes]] as proposed by [[Carl von Linné]]. All animals have [[muscle]]s but, since muscles can only pull, never push, a number of animals have developed hard parts that the muscles can pull on, commonly called skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such skeletons may be internal, as in [[vertebrates]], or external, as in [[arthropods]]. However, many animals groups do very well without hard parts.&lt;ref name=Barns&gt;Ruppert, E. E.; Fox, R. S.; Barnes, R. D. (2004) ''Invertebrate Zoology'' (7th ed.). Brooks / Cole. {{ISBN|0-03-025982-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This include animals such as [[earthworms]], [[jellyfish]], [[tapeworms]], [[squids]] and an enormous variety of animals from almost every part of the kingdom Animalia.

== Commonality ==
Most soft-bodied animals are small, but they do make up the majority of the animal [[biomass]]. If we were to weigh up all animals on Earth with hard parts against soft-bodied ones, estimates indicate that the biomass of soft-bodied animals would be at least twice that of animals with hard parts, quite possibly much larger.&lt;ref&gt;Greenstreet, S.; Robinson, L.; Reiss, H.; Craeymeersch, J.; Callaway, R.; Goffin, A.; Jørgensen, L.; Robertson, M.; Kröncke, I.; de Boois, I.; Jacob, N.; Lancaster, J.

The nematodologist [[Nathan Cobb]] described the ubiquitous presence of nematodes on Earth as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In  short, if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still be dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes, and oceans represented by a film of nematodes. The location of towns would be decipherable, since for  every massing of human beings there would be a corresponding massing of certain nematodes. Trees would still stand in ghostly rows representing our streets and highways. The location of the various plants and animals would still be decipherable, and, had we sufficient knowledge, in many cases even their species could be determined by an examination of their erstwhile nematode parasites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cobb|first = N.

==Anatomy==
Not being a true [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] group, soft-bodied organisms vary enormously in anatomy. [[Cnidarian]]s and [[flatworms]] have a single opening to the gut and a diffuse [[nerve system]]. The [[roundworms]], [[annelids]], [[molluscs]], the various [[lophophorata|lophoporate]] [[Phylum|phyla]] and non-vertebrate [[Chordata|chordates]] have a tubular gut open at both ends. While the majority of the soft-bodied animals typically don't have any kind of skeleton, some do, mainly in the form of stiff [[cuticle]]s (roundworms, [[tardigrada|water bears]]) or [[hydrostatic skeleton]]s (annelids).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last2=Barnes|first1=Edward E.|last1=Ruppert|first2=Robert D.|title=Invertebrate Zoology|year=1991|publisher=Saunders College Publ.

While lack of a skeleton typically restricts the body size of soft-bodied animals on land, marine representatives can grow to very large sizes. The heaviest soft-bodied organisms are likely the [[giant squid]]s, with maximum weight estimated at {{convert|275|kg|lb}} for females, while arctic [[lion's mane jellyfish]] may reach comparable sizes.&lt;ref name=OShea&gt;O'Shea, S.

Retrieved July 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Most soft-bodied organisms are as small or smaller, even microscopic. The various organisms grouped as [[mesozoa]]ns and the curious [[Placozoa]] are typically composed of just a few hundred [[cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=Barns/&gt;

The '''soil seed bank''' is the natural storage of [[seed]]s, often dormant, within the [[soil]] of most [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="dekker"/&gt;  The study of soil seed banks started in 1859 when [[Charles Darwin]] observed the emergence of seedlings using soil samples from the bottom of a lake. The first scientific paper on the subject was published in 1882 and reported on the occurrence of seeds at different soil depths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-90161998000500013&amp;script=sci_arttext  P.J. Christoffoleti; R.S.X. Caetano 1998. Soil seed banks Scientia Agricola: 55: 74-78.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Weed seed banks have been studied intensely in [[agricultural science]] because of their important economic impacts; other fields interested in soil seed banks include [[silviculture|forest regeneration]] and [[restoration ecology]].

== Background ==

Many [[taxon|taxa]] have been classified according to the longevity of their seeds in the soil seed bank.  Seeds of ''transient'' species remain viable in the soil seed bank only to the next opportunity to [[germinate]], while seeds of  ''persistent'' species can survive longer than the next opportunity—often much longer than one year.  Species with seeds that remain viable in the soil longer than five years form the ''long-term'' persistent seed bank, while species whose seeds generally germinate or die within one to five years are called ''short-term'' persistent. A typical long-term persistent species is ''[[Chenopodium album]]'' (Lambsquarters); its seeds commonly remain viable in the soil for up to 40 years and in rare situations perhaps as long as 1,600 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agron.iastate.edu/~weeds/weedbiollibrary/u4lq1.html  Iowa State University: College of Agriculture and Life Science: Lambsquarters]&lt;/ref&gt;   A species forming no soil seed bank at all (except the dry season between ripening and the first autumnal rains) is ''[[Agrostemma githago]]'' (Corncockle), which was formerly a widespread cereal weed.

== Seed longevity ==
[[File:DriedLotusSeeds.jpg|thumb|190px|Dried lotus seeds]]
Longevity of seeds is very variable and depends on many factors; few species exceed 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Thompson, Jan P. Bakker, and Renée M. Bekker. 1997. The soil seed banks of north west Europe : methodology, density and longevity. New York : Cambridge University Press. p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; In typical soils the longevity of seeds can range from nearly zero (germinating immediately when reaching the soil or even before) to several hundred years. Some of the oldest still-viable seeds were those of [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]] (''Nelumbo nucifera'') found buried in the soil of a pond; these seeds were estimated by [[carbon dating]] to be around 1,200 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aE414KuXu4gC&amp;pg=PA15|authors=J. Derek Bewley, Michael Black and Peter Halmer|title=The Encyclopedia of Seeds: Science, Technology and Uses|publisher=CABI|year=2006|pages=14–15|isbn=978-0851997230}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[cultivar]] of [[date palm]], the [[Judean date palm]], successfully sprouted in 2008 after accidental storage for 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |date=2008-06-17 |title=Date Seed of Masada is Oldest Ever to Sprout |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/science/17obseed.html |access-date=December 9, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the longest-running soil seed viability trials was started in [[Michigan]] in 1879 by [[William James Beal|James Beal]]. The experiment involved the burying of 20 bottles holding 50 seeds from 21 species. Every five years, a bottle from every species was retrieved and germinated on a tray of sterilized soil which was kept in a growth chamber. Later, after responsibility for managing the experiment was delegated to caretakers, the period between retrievals became longer. In 1980, more than 100 years after the trial was started, seeds of only three species were observed to germinate: [[Verbascum blattaria|moth mullein]] (''Verbascum blattaria''), [[Verbascum thapsus|common mullein]] (''Verbascum thapsus'') and [[Malva neglecta|common mallow]] (''Malva neglecta'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank W. Telewski|url=http://www.cpa.msu.edu/beal/research/research_frames.htm|title=Research &amp; Teaching|publisher=Department of Plant Biology, Michigan State University|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental significance ==

Soil seed banks play an important role in the [[natural environment]] of many ecosystems. For example, the rapid re-vegetation of sites disturbed by wildfire, catastrophic weather, agricultural operations, and timber harvesting is largely due to the soil seed bank. [[Forest ecosystem]]s and [[wetland]]s contain a number of specialized plant species forming persistent soil seed banks.

Before the advent of herbicides, a good example of a persistent seed bank species was ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'', sometimes so abundant in agricultural fields in Europe that it could be mistaken for a crop.

The absence of a soil seed bank impedes the establishment of vegetation during [[primary succession]], while presence of a well-stocked soil seed bank permits rapid development of species-rich ecosystems during [[secondary succession]].

== Population densities and diversity ==

The mortality of seeds in the soil is one of the key factors for the persistence and density fluctuations of plant populations, especially for annual plants. Studies on the genetic structure of  ''Androsace septentrionalis'' populations in the seed bank compared to those of established plants showed that diversity within populations is higher below ground than above ground.

There are indications that mutations are more important for species forming a persistent seed bank compared to those with only transient seeds. The increase of species richness in a plant community due to a species-rich and abundant soil seed bank is known as the ''storage effect''.

Species of ''[[Striga]]'' (witchweed) are known to leave some of the highest seed densities in the soil compared to other plant [[genera]]; this is a major factor that aids their invasive potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Merrill A.|last1=Ross|first2=Carole A.|last2=Lembi|title=Applied Weed Science: Including the Ecology and Management of Invasive Plants|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2008|page=22|isbn=978-0135028148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each plant has the capability to produce between 90,000 and 450,000 seeds, although a majority of these seeds are not viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Faiz F. Bebawi, Robert E. Eplee and Rebecca S.

== Associated ecosystem processes ==
The term '''soil [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspore]] bank''' can be used to include non-flowering plants such as [[fern]]s and [[bryophyte]]s.

In addition to seeds, [[perennial plant]]s have vegetative [[propagule]]s to facilitate forming new plants, migration into new ground, or reestablishment after being top-killed.  These propagules are collectively called the 'soil bud bank', and include dormant and adventitious [[buds]] on [[stolons]], [[rhizomes]], and [[bulb]]s.&lt;ref name="dekker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agron-www.agron.iastate.edu/~weeds/Ag317/bioeco/lifecycle/seedbank.html|title=The Soil Seed Bank|publisher=Agronomy Department, Iowa State University|author=Jack Dekker|year=1997|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conger type callus 3ms White Light.TIF|thumb|[[Switchgrass]] somatic embryos]]'''Somatic embryogenesis''' is an artificial process in which a plant or embryo is derived from a single [[somatic cell]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahoo|first=Jyoti Prakash|date=2018-06-11|title=Organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332465054|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.26278.57928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No [[endosperm]] or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo.

Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a [[callus (cell biology)|callus]]. [[Plant hormone|Plant growth regulators]] in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form the callus. The ratio of different [[plant growth regulators]] required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessexcellence.org/LC/ST/st2bgplant.html ''Plant Tissue Culture''&lt;/ref&gt; Somatic embryos are mainly produced ''[[in vitro]]'' and for laboratory purposes, using either solid or liquid [[Growth medium|nutrient media]] which contain plant growth regulators (PGR’s). The main PGRs used are [[auxins]] but can contain [[cytokinin]] in a smaller amount.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;E.F. George et al. (eds.), Plant Propagation by Tissue Culture 3rd Edition, 335-354.&lt;/ref&gt; Shoots and roots are monopolar while somatic embryos are bipolar, allowing them to form a whole plant without culturing on multiple media types. Somatic embryogenesis has served as a model to understand the physiological and biochemical events that occur during plant developmental processes as well as a component to biotechnological advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Quiroz-Figueroa, F. R., Rojas-Herrera, R., Galaz-Avalos, R. M., and Loyola- Vargas, V. M. 2006. Embryo production through somatic embryogenesis can be used to study cell differentiation in plants. Plant Cell Tiss. Org. Cult. 86: 285–301.&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of somatic embryogenesis was by Steward et al. in 1958 and Reinert in 1959 with carrot cell suspension cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Steward, F.C., Mapes, M.O., and Smlth, J. (1958). Growth and organized development of cultured cells. I. Growth and division of freely suspended cells. Am. J. Bot. 45, 693-703.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinert J (1959) Uber die kontrolle der morphogenese und die induktion von adventivembryonen an gew- ebekulturen aus karotten. Planta 53:318–333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct and indirect embryogenesis==
Somatic embryogenesis has been described to occur in two ways: directly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp et al. (1980). In: Horticultural Reviews, Vol. 2. (janick, J., ed.). AVI Publishing Co, Westport, Conn., USA, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct embryogenesis ===
occurs when embryos are started directly from explant tissue creating an identical clone. In other words without callus formation of embryo from explant, that is called direct embryogenesis.

=== Indirect embryogenesis ===
occurs when explants produced undifferentiated, or partially differentiated, cells (often referred to as callus) which then is maintained or differentiated into plant tissues such as leaf, stem, or roots. [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)]], [[6-Benzylaminopurine|6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP)]] and [[Gibberellic acid|Gibberellic acid (GA)]] has been used for development of indirect somatic embryos in strawberry (''Fragaria ananassa'') &lt;ref&gt;Waghmare, S. G., Pawar, K. R., and Tabe, R. 2017. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316439140_Somatic_embryogenesis_in_Strawberry_Fragaria_ananassa_var_Camarosa Somatic embryogenesis in Strawberry  (Fragaria ananassa) var. Camarosa.] Global Journal of Bioscience and Biotechnology 6(2): 309 - 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant regeneration by somatic embryogenesis==
Plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis occurs in five steps: initiation of embryogenic cultures, proliferation of embryogenic cultures, prematuration of somatic embryos, maturation of somatic embryos and plant development on nonspecific media.
Initiation and proliferation occur on a medium rich in auxin, which induces differentiation of localized [[Meristem|meristematic cells]]. The [[auxin]] typically used is [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]]. Once transferred to a medium with low or no [[auxin]], these cells can then develop into mature [[embryo]]s. Germination of the somatic embryo can only occur when it is mature enough to have functional [[root]] and [[shoot]] apices &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Factors influencing==
Factors and mechanisms controlling cell differentiation in somatic embryos are relatively ambiguous. Certain compounds excreted by plant tissue cultures and found in culture media have been shown necessary to coordinate cell division and morphological changes.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, G.S., Fowler, M.W.  1981.  Physiological interactions during the initial stages of embryogenesis in cultures of Daucus carota L. New Phytol 87:481-486.&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds have been identified by Chung et al.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, W., Pedersen, H., Chin, C-K.  1992. Enhanced somatic embryo production by conditioned media in cell suspension cultures of Daucus carota. Biotechnol Lett 14:837-840.&lt;/ref&gt; as various [[polysaccharide]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[Growth hormone|growth regulators]], [[vitamin]]s, low molecular weight compounds and polypeptides. Several [[signaling molecules]] known to influence or control the formation of somatic embryos have been found and include extracellular proteins, arabinogalactan proteins and lipochitooligosaccharides. Temperature and lighting can also affect the maturation of the somatic embryo.

== Applications ==
Applications of this process include: [[clonal propagation]] of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of [[virus]]es; provision of source tissue for genetic [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]; generation of whole plants from single cells called [[protoplast]]s; development of synthetic seed technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Forestry related example ===

The development of somatic embryogenesis procedures has given rise to research on seed storage proteins (SSPs) of [[woody plant]]s for tree species of commercial importance, i.e., mainly [[gymnosperm]]s, including [[white spruce]]. In this area of study, SSPs are used as markers to determine the embryogenic potential and competency of the embryogenic system to produce a somatic embryo biochemically similar to its [[Zygote|zygotic]] counterpart (Flinn et al. 1991, Beardmore et al. 1997).&lt;ref name="flinn"&gt;Flinn, B.S.; Roberts, D.R.; Webb, D.T.; Sutton, B.C. 1991.

Proc. Intermountain Forest Nursery Association, Aug. 1991, Park City UT. USDA, For. Serv., Rocky Mount. For. Range Exp. Sta., Fort Collins CO, Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-211.&lt;/ref&gt; compared interior spruce [[seedling]]s with emblings during nursery development and through a stock quality assessment program immediately before field outplanting. Seedling shoot height, [[Root crown|root collar]] diameter, and dry weight increased at a greater rate in seedlings than in emblings during the first half of the first growing season, but thereafter shoot growth was similar among all plants. By the end of the growing season, seedlings were 70% taller than emblings, had greater root collar diameter, and greater shoot dry weight. Root dry weight increased more rapidly in seedlings than in emblings during the early growing season

During fall acclimation, the pattern of increasing dormancy release index and increasing tolerance to freezing was similar in both seedlings and emblings. Root growth capacity decreased then increased during fall acclimation, with the increase being greater in seedlings.

Assessment of stock quality just prior to planting showed that: emblings had greater water use efficiency with decreasing predawn shoot water potential compared with seedlings; seedlings and emblings had similar water movement capability at both high and low root temperatures; net photosynthesis and needle conductance at low root temperatures were greater in seedlings than in emblings; and seedlings had greater root growth than emblings at 22&amp;nbsp;°C root, but root growth among all plants was low at 7.5&amp;nbsp;°C root temperature.

Growth and survival of interior spruce 313B Styroblock seedlings and emblings after outplanting on a reforestation site were determined by Grossnickle and Major (1992).&lt;ref name="gross1"&gt;Grossnickle, S.C.; Major, J.E. 1992. Interior spruce seedlings compared to emblings produced from somatic embryogenesis. 2. Physiological response and morphological development on a reforestation site. p. 98 (abstr.) ''in'' Colombo, S.J.; Hogan, G.; Wearn, V. (Compilers &amp; Eds.), Proc. 12th North Amer., For. Biol. Workshop: The Role of Physiology and Genetics in Forest Ecosystem Research and Monitoring, Sault Ste. Marie ON, Aug. 1992. Ont. Min. Nat. Res., Ont. For. Res. Instit., and For. Can., Ont. Region.&lt;/ref&gt; For both seedlings and emblings, osmotic potential at saturation (ψ&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;) and turgor loss point (ψ&lt;sub&gt;tip&lt;/sub&gt;) increased from a low of -1.82 and -2.22 MPa, respectively, just prior to planting to a seasonal high of -1.09 and -1.21 MPa, respectively, during active shoot elongation. Thereafter, seedlings and emblings (ψ&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;) and (ψ&lt;sub&gt;tip&lt;/sub&gt;) declined to -2.00 and -2.45 MPa, respectively, at the end of the growing season, which coincided with the steady decline in site temperatures and a cessation of height growth. In general, seedlings and emblings had similar ψ&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ&lt;sub&gt;tip&lt;/sub&gt; values through the growing season, and also had similar shifts in seasonal patterns of maximum modulus of elasticity, sympalstic fraction, and relative water content at [[Turgor pressure|turgor loss]] point.

Grossnickle and Major (1992)&lt;ref name="gross1" /&gt; found that year-old and current-year needles of both seedlings and emblings had a similar decline in needle conductance with increasing [[vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] deficit. Response surface models of current-year needles net photosynthesis (P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) response to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) showed that emblings had 15% greater P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; at VPD of less than 3.0 kPa and PAR greater than 1000 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Year-old and current-year needles of seedlings and emblings showed similar patterns of water use efficiency.

Rates of shoot growth in seedlings and emblings through the growing season were also similar to one another. Seedlings had larger shoot systems both at the time of planting and at the end of the growing season. Seedlings also had greater root development than emblings through the growing season, but root:shoot ratios for the 2 stock types were similar at the end of the growing season, when the survival rates for seedlings and emblings were 96% and 99%, respectively.

==Tracking and fate maps==
Understanding the formation of a somatic embryo through establishment of morphological and molecular markers is important for construction of a fate map. The fate map is the foundation in which to build further research and experimentation. Two methods exist to construct a fate map: synchronous cell-division and time-lapse tracking. The latter typically works more consistently because of cell-cycle-altering chemicals and centrifuging involved in synchronous cell-division.&lt;ref name =Yang&gt;Yang, Xiyan and Zhang, Xianlong(2010) 'Regulation of Somatic embryogenesis in Higher Plants', Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, 29: 1, 36 — 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angiosperms==
Embryo development in angiosperms is divided into several steps. The zygote is divided asymmetrically forming a small apical cell and large basal cell. The organizational pattern is formed in the globular stage and the embryo then transitions to the cotyledonary stage.&lt;ref name=VonArnold&gt;Von Arnold S, Sabala I, Bozhkov P, Dyachok J and Filonova L (2002) Developmental pathways of somatic embryogenesis. Plant Cell Tiss Org. Cult. 69: 233–249&lt;/ref&gt; Embryo development differs in monocots and dicots. Dicots pass through the globular, heart-shaped, and torpedo stages while monocots pass through globular, scutellar, and coleoptilar stages.&lt;ref&gt;Jime ́nez VM, Thomas C (2005) Participation of plant hormones in determination and progression of somatic embryogenesis. in: Mujib A, Šamaj J (eds) Somatic embryogenesis. Springer, Berlin, pp 103–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many culture systems induce and maintain somatic embryogenesis by continuous exposure to [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]]. [[Abscisic acid]] has been reported to induce somatic embryogenesis in seedlings. After [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] formation, culturing on a low auxin or hormone free media will promote somatic embryo growth and root formation. In [[monocots]], embryogenic capability is usually restricted to tissues with embryogenic or meristematic origin. Somatic cells of monocots differentiate quickly and then lose mitotic and morphogenic capability. Differences of auxin sensitivity in embryogenic callus growth between different genotypes of the same species show how variable auxin responses can be.&lt;ref&gt;Fehér, Attila. Why somatic plant cells start to form embryos? In: Mujid, Abdul and Samaj, Josef. eds. Somatic Embryogenesis. Plant Cell Monographs, Springer; Berlin/Heidelberg, 2005, vol. 2, p. 85-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daucus carota|Carrot ''Daucus carota'']] was the first and most understood species with regard to developmental pathways and molecular mechanisms.&lt;ref name= Yang/&gt; Time-lapse tracking by Toonen et al. (1994) showed that morphology of competent cells can vary based on shape and cytoplasm density. Five types of cells were identified from embryonic suspension: spherical cytoplasm-rich, spherical vacuolated, oval vacuolated, elongated vacuolated, and irregular shaped cells. Each type of cell multiplied with certain geometric symmetry. They developed into symmetrical, asymmetrical, and aberrantly-shaped cell clusters that eventually formed embryos at different frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;Toonen, M. A. J., Hendriks, T., Schmidt, E. D. L., Verhoeven, H. A., [[Ab van Kammen|van Kammen, A.]], and De Vries, S. C. 1994. Description of somatic-embryo- forming single cells in carrot suspension cultures employing video cell tracking. Planta 194: 565–572.&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that organized growth polarity do not always exist in somatic embryogenesis.&lt;ref name= Yang/&gt;

==Gymnosperms==
{{anchor|Proembryogeny}}
Embryo development in [[gymnosperms]] occurs in three phases. '''Proembryogeny''' includes all stages prior to [[suspensor]] elongation. Early embryogeny includes all stages after suspensor elongation but before root meristem development. Late embryogeny includes development of root and shoot meristems.&lt;ref name=VonArnold/&gt;
Time-lapse tracking in [[Picea abies|Norway Spruce ''Picea abies'']] revealed that neither single cytoplasmic-rich cells nor vacuolated cells developed into embryos. Proembryogenic masses (PEMs), an intermediate between unorganized cells and an embryo composed of cytoplasmic-rich cells next to a vacuolated cell, are stimulated with [[auxin]] and [[cytokinin]]. Gradual removal of auxin and cytokinin and introduction of [[abscisic acid]] (ABA) will allow an embryo to form.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt; Using somatic embryogenesis has been considered for mass production of vegetatively propagated conifer clones and cryopreservation of [[germplasm]]. However, the use of this technology for reforestation and tree breeding of conifers is in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Häggman H.; Vuosku J.; Sarjala T.; Jokela A.; Niemi K.

'''Somatic fusion''', also called '''protoplast fusion''', is a type of [[genetic modification]] in plants by which two distinct species of plants are fused together to form a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] plant with the characteristics of both, a '''somatic hybrid'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Somatic Cell Hybridization|first1=K.

Uses of somatic fusion include making potato plants resistant to [[Potato leafroll virus|potato leaf roll disease]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Applications of hybrid cells==

[[Somatic cell]]s of different types can be fused to obtain hybrid cells. Hybrid cells are useful in a variety of ways, e.g.,
:(i) to study the control of [[cell division]] and [[gene expression]],
:(ii) to investigate [[malignant transformation]]s,
:(iii) to obtain [[viral replication]],
:(iv) for [[Gene mapping|gene]] or [[chromosome map]]ping and for
:(v) production of [[monoclonal antibodies]] by producing [[Hybridoma technology|hybridoma]] (hybrid cells between an immortalised cell and an [[antibody]] producing [[lymphocyte]]), etc.

[[Chromosome]] mapping through somatic cell hybridization is essentially based on fusion of human and [[mouse]] somatic cells. Generally, human [[fibrocyte]]s or [[White blood cells|leucocytes]] are fused with mouse continuous [[cell line]]s.

When human and mouse cells (or cells of any two [[mammal]]ian species or of the same species) are mixed, spontaneous [[cell fusion]] occurs at a very low rate (10-6). Cell fusion is enhanced 100 to 1000 times by the addition of [[ultraviolet]] inactivated [[Sendai virus|Sendai]] (parainfluenza) virus or [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG).

These agents adhere to the [[plasma membrane]]s of cells and alter their properties in such a way that facilitates their fusion. Fusion of two cells produces a heterokaryon, i.e., a single hybrid cell with two nuclei, one from each of the cells entering fusion. Subsequently, the two nuclei also fuse to yield a hybrid cell with a single nucleus.

A generalized scheme for somatic cell hybridization may be described as follows. Appropriate human and mouse cells are selected and mixed together in the presence of inactivated Sendai virus or PEG to promote cell fusion. After a period of time, the cells (a mixture of man, mouse and 'hybrid' cells) are plated on a [[selective medium]], e.g., [[HAT medium]], which allows the [[multiplication]] of hybrid cells only.

Several [[clone (cell biology)|clone]]s (each derived from a single hybrid cell) of the hybrid cells are thus isolated and subjected to both [[Cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and appropriate [[Biochemical analysis|biochemical analyses]] for the detection of [[enzyme]]/ [[protein]]/[[trait (biology)|trait]] under investigation. An attempt is now made to correlate the presence and absence of the trait with the presence and absence of a [[human chromosome]] in the hybrid clones.

If there is a perfect [[correlation]] between the presence and absence of a human chromosome and that of a trait in the hybrid clones, the gene governing the trait is taken to be located in the concerned chromosome.

The HAT medium is one of the several selective media used for the selection of hybrid cells. This medium is supplemented with [[hypoxanthine]], [[aminopterin]] and [[thymidine]], hence the name HAT medium. [[Antimetabolite]] aminopterin blocks the cellular [[biosynthesis]] of [[purine]]s and [[pyrimidine]]s from [[simple sugar]]s and [[amino acid]]s.
However, normal human and mouse cells can still multiply as they can utilize hypoxanthine and thymidine present in the medium through a [[salvage pathway]], which ordinarily recycles the purines and pyrimidines produced from degradation of [[nucleic acid]]s.
Hypoxanthine is converted into [[guanine]] by the enzyme [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (HGPRT), while thymidine is [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] by [[thymidine kinase]] (TK); both HGPRT and TK are enzymes of the salvage pathway.
On a HAT medium, only those cells that have active HGPRT (HGPRT+) and TK (TK+) enzymes can proliferate, while those deficient in these enzymes (HGPRr- and/or TK-) can not divide (since they cannot produce purines and pyrimidines due to the aminopterin present in the HAT medium).
For using HAT medium as a selective agent, [[human cell]]s used for fusion must be deficient for either the enzyme HGPRT or TK, while mouse cells must be deficient for the other enzyme of this pair. Thus, one may fuse HGPRT deficient human cells (designated as TK+ HGPRr-) with TK deficient mouse cells (denoted as TK- HGPRT+).
Their fusion products (hybrid cells) will be TK+ (due to the human [[gene]]) and HGPRT+ (due to the mouse gene) and will multiply on the HAT medium, while the man and mouse cells will fail to do so. Experiments with other selective media can be planned in a similar fashion.

==Characteristics of somatic hybridization and cybridization ==

# Somatic cell fusion appears to be the only means through which two different parental [[genome]]s can be [[Genetic recombination|recombined]] among plants that cannot [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] (asexual or sterile).
# Protoplasts of sexually sterile ([[haploid]], [[triploid]], and [[aneuploid]]) plants can be fused to produce fertile [[diploid]]s and [[polyploid]]s.
# Somatic cell fusion overcomes sexual incompatibility barriers. In some cases somatic hybrids between two incompatible plants have also found application in [[Industrial sector|industry]] or [[agriculture]].
# Somatic cell fusion is useful in the study of cytoplasmic genes and their activities and this information can be applied in [[plant breeding]] experiments.

===Inter-specific and inter-generic fusion achievements===
Note: The table only lists a few examples, there are many more crosses. The possibilities of this technology are great; however, not all species are easily put into protoplast culture.

'''Sonic characteristics of marine species''' - Noise in the [[ocean]] is of utmost importance for ocean explorations, [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] as well as [[fisheries]] studies, [[sonar]] operations, etc. The wide range of systems for ocean research demands the need for characterizing the noise sources in the ocean. The ambient noise in the ocean is composite in nature, with components emanating from a variety of noise sources. The problem of identification of noise sources in the ocean is of prime importance because of its diverse practical applications. In view of the importance of the area of identification of noise sources, there is a need and requirement for characterizing the noise sources in the ocean which are of both man made and biological in origin.

[[File:Schematic of Sonoporation Mechanism drawn by Bryan Maghen.pdf|thumb|390x390px|Schematic of Sonoporation Mechanism. This figure depicts the general understanding of sonoporation where a dedicated sonoporator applies ultrasound to induce microbubble cavitation and eventually pore formation. The therapeutic gene or drug of interest thus may translocate within the cell.]]
'''Sonoporation''', or '''cellular sonication''', is the [[sonication|use of sound]] (typically ultrasonic frequencies) for modifying the permeability of the [[cell membrane|cell plasma membrane]]. This technique is usually used in [[molecular biology]] and non-viral [[gene therapy]] in order to allow uptake of large molecules such as [[DNA]] into the cell, in a [[cell disruption]] process called [[transfection]] or [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]].  Sonoporation employs the acoustic [[cavitation]] of [[microbubbles]] to enhance delivery of these large molecules.&lt;ref name="PMC2095817"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song Y, Hahn T, Thompson IP, Mason TJ, Preston GM, Li G, Paniwnyk L, Huang WE | display-authors = 6 | title = Ultrasound-mediated DNA transfer for bacteria | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 19 | pages = e129 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17890732 | pmc = 2095817 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkm710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact mechanism of sonoporation-mediated membrane translocation remains unclear, with a few different hypotheses currently being explored. 

Sonoporation is under active study for the introduction of foreign [[gene]]s in tissue culture cells, especially [[mammal]]ian cells.  Sonoporation is also being studied for use in targeted [[Gene therapy]] [[in vivo]], in a medical treatment scenario whereby a patient is given modified DNA, and an ultrasonic transducer might target this modified DNA into specific regions of the patient's body.&lt;ref name="isbn9789812566850"&gt;{{cite book|title=Emerging Therapeutic Ultrasound|vauthors=Wu J, Le Mars Nyborg W|year=2006|isbn=978-981-256-685-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bioactivity of this technique is similar to, and in some cases found superior to, [[electroporation]]. Extended exposure to low-frequency (&lt;[[MHz]]) ultrasound has been demonstrated to result in complete cellular death (rupturing), thus cellular [[wikt:viability|viability]] must also be accounted for when employing this technique.

==Equipment==
Sonoporation is performed with a dedicated sonoporator. Sonoporation may also be performed with custom-built [[Ultrasonic transducer|piezoelectric transducers]] connected to bench-top function generators and acoustic amplifiers. Standard [[ultrasound]] medical devices may also be used in some applications.

Measurement of the acoustics used in sonoporation is listed in terms of [[mechanical index]], which quantifies the likelihood that exposure to diagnostic ultrasound will produce an adverse biological effect by a non-thermal action based on pressure.&lt;ref name="Church2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Church CC |title=Frequency, pulse length, and the mechanical index |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online  |year=2005 |doi=10.1121/1.1901757 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=162–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microbubble contrast agents==
[[Microbubble]] contrast agents are generally used in [[contrast-enhanced ultrasound]] applications to enhance the acoustic impact of ultrasound. For sonoporation specifically, microbubbles are used to significantly enhance membrane translocation of molecular therapeutics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Fowlkes JB, Kripfgans OD, Carson PL |title=Microbubbles for ultrasound diagnosis and therapy|journal=2004 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Macro to Nano (IEEE Cat No. 04EX821)|year=2004|volume=2|pages=29–32|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/isbi.2004.1398466|isbn=0-7803-8388-5|s2cid=29683103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General features ===
The microbubbles used today are composed of a gas core and a surrounding shell. The makeup of these elements may vary depending on the preferred physical and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klibanov AL | title = Microbubble contrast agents: targeted ultrasound imaging and ultrasound-assisted drug-delivery applications | journal = Investigative Radiology | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 354–362 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16481920 | doi = 10.1097/01.rli.0000199292.88189.0f | s2cid = 27546582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microbubble shells have been formed with [[Lipid|lipids]], [[galactose]], [[albumin]], or [[polymers]]. The gas core can be made up of air or heavy gases like [[nitrogen]] or [[perfluorocarbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindner JR | title = Microbubbles in medical imaging: current applications and future directions | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 527–532 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15173842 | doi = 10.1038/nrd1417 | s2cid = 29807146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism of action ===
Microbubble gas cores have high compressibility relative to their liquid environment, making them highly responsive to acoustic application. As a result of ultrasound stimulation, microbubbles undergo rapid expansion and contraction, otherwise known as [[cavitation]]. When a microbubble is attached to the [[cell membrane]], the microbubble cavitation [[Oscillation|oscillations]] produced by ultrasound stimulation will push and pull on the membrane to produce a membrane opening. These rapid oscillations are also responsible for adjacent fluid flow called microstreaming which increases pressure on surrounding cells producing further sonoporation to whole cell populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fan Z, Kumon RE, Deng CX | title = Mechanisms of microbubble-facilitated sonoporation for drug and gene delivery | journal = Therapeutic Delivery | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 467–486 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24856171 | doi = 10.4155/tde.14.10|pmc=4116608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membrane translocation mechanism ==
The mechanism by which molecules cross cellular membrane barriers during sonoporation remains unclear. Different theories exist that may potentially explain barrier permeabilization and molecular delivery. The dominant hypotheses include pore formation, [[endocytosis]], and membrane wounds.

=== Pore formation ===
[[File:Endocytosis.png|thumb|417x417px|Schematic representation of molecular translocation via endocytosis. The second representation from the left illustrates the endocytotic mechanism involving clathrin-coated pits.]]
Pore formation following ultrasound application was first reported in 1999 in a study that observed cell membrane craters following ultrasound application at 255 kHz.&lt;ref name="Bouakaz_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouakaz A, Zeghimi A, Doinikov AA | title = Sonoporation: Concept and Mechanisms | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 880 | pages = 175–189 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26486338 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-22536-4_10 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | isbn = 978-3-319-22536-4 | veditors = Escoffre JM, Bouakaz A | place = Cham }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, sonoporation mediated [[microinjection]] of [[dextran]] molecules showed that membrane permeability mechanisms differ depending on the size of dextran molecules. Microinjection of dextran molecules from 3 to 70 kDa was reported to have crossed the cellular membrane via transient pores. In contrast, dextran molecules of 155 and 500 kDa were predominantly found in vesicle-like structures, likely indicating the mechanism of [[endocytosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meijering BD, Juffermans LJ, van Wamel A, Henning RH, Zuhorn IS, Emmer M, Versteilen AM, Paulus WJ, van Gilst WH, Kooiman K, de Jong N, Musters RJ, Deelman LE, Kamp O | display-authors = 6 | title = Ultrasound and microbubble-targeted delivery of macromolecules is regulated by induction of endocytosis and pore formation | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 104 | issue = 5 | pages = 679–687 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19168443 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.183806 | s2cid = 23063345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This variability in membrane behavior has led to other studies investigating membrane rupture and resealing characteristics depending on ultrasound amplitude and duration.

=== Endocytosis ===
Various cellular reactions to ultrasound indicate the mechanism of molecular uptake via endocytosis. These observed reactionary phenomena include [[ion exchange]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and cell intracellular calcium concentration. Studies have used [[Patch clamp|patch clamping]] techniques to monitor [[Membrane potential|membrane potential ion exchange]] for the role of endocytosis in sonoporation. Ultrasound application to cells and adjacent microbubbles was shown to produce marked cell membrane [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] along with progressive intracellular calcium increase, which is believed to be a consequence of [[Calcium channel|calcium channels]] opening in response to microbubble oscillations. These findings act as support for ultrasound application inducing calcium-mediated uncoating of [[Clathrin|clathrin-coated pits]] seen in traditional endocytosis pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hauser J, Ellisman M, Steinau HU, Stefan E, Dudda M, Hauser M | title = Ultrasound enhanced endocytotic activity of human fibroblasts | journal = Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 12 | pages = 2084–2092 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19828232 | doi = 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2009.06.1090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tran TA, Roger S, Le Guennec JY, Tranquart F, Bouakaz A | title = Effect of ultrasound-activated microbubbles on the cell electrophysiological properties | journal = Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–163 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17189059 | doi = 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.07.029 | url = https://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00141873/file/Tran_et_al_2006.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work reported sonoporation induced the formation of hydrogen peroxide, a cellular reaction that is also known to be involved with endocytosis.&lt;ref name="Bouakaz_2016" /&gt;

=== Membrane wounds ===
Mechanically created wounds in the plasma membrane have been observed as a result of sonoporation-produced [[Shear force|shear forces]]. The nature of these wounds may vary based on the degree of acoustic cavitation leading to a spectrum of cell behavior, from membrane [[Bleb (cell biology)|blebbing]] to instant [[Lysis|cell lysis]]. Multiple studies examining membrane wounds note observing resealing behavior, a process dependent on recruitment of ATP and intracellular vesicles.&lt;ref name="Bouakaz_2016" /&gt;

=== Membrane resealing ===
Following sonoporation-mediated membrane permeabilization, cells can automatically repair the membrane openings through a phenomenon called "reparable sonoporation."&lt;ref name="Wu_2018"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Wu J |date=2018-12-18|title=Acoustic Streaming and Its Applications |journal=Fluids |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=108 |doi=10.3390/fluids3040108|bibcode=2018Fluid...3..108W|issn=2311-5521|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membrane resealing process has been shown to be calcium-dependent. This property may suggest that the membrane repair process involves a cell's active repair mechanism in response to the cellular influx of calcium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou Y, Shi J, Cui J, Deng CX | title = Effects of extracellular calcium on cell membrane resealing in sonoporation | journal = Journal of Controlled Release | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–43 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18158198 | pmc = 2270413 | doi = 10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preclinical studies ==
[[File:Chart showing efficacy of acoustic targeted drug delivery.jpg|thumb|569x569px|A study showing verified preclinical efficacy of acoustic targeted drug delivery.]]

=== In vitro ===
The first study reporting molecular delivery using ultrasound was a 1987 in vitro study attempting to transfer [[plasmid]] DNA to cultured mouse [[fibroblast]] cells using sonoporation.&lt;ref name="Tomizawa_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomizawa M, Shinozaki F, Motoyoshi Y, Sugiyama T, Yamamoto S, Sueishi M | title = Sonoporation: Gene transfer using ultrasound | journal = World Journal of Methodology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 39–44 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 25237622 | pmc = 4145571 | doi = 10.5662/wjm.v3.i4.39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This successful plasmid DNA [[transfection]] conferring G418 [[antibiotic resistance]] ultimately led to further in vitro studies that hinted at the potential for sonoporation transfection of plasmid DNA and [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]] in vivo.

=== In vivo ===
In vivo ultrasound mediated drug delivery was first reported in 1991&lt;ref name="Tomizawa_2013" /&gt; and many other preclinical studies involving sonoporation have followed. This method is being used to deliver therapeutic drugs or genes to treat a variety of diseases including: [[Stroke]], [[Cancer]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]], [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]]...&lt;ref name="Wu_2018" /&gt; The preclinical utility of sonoporation is well illustrated through past tumor radiation treatments which have reported a more than 10-fold cellular destruction when [[ionizing radiation]] is coupled with ultrasound-mediated microbubble vascular disruption. This increase in delivery efficiency could allow for the appropriate reduction in therapeutic dosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alter J, Sennoga CA, Lopes DM, Eckersley RJ, Wells DJ | title = Microbubble stability is a major determinant of the efficiency of ultrasound and microbubble mediated in vivo gene transfer | journal = Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 976–984 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19285783 | doi = 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.12.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SOS chromotest''' is a biological assay to assess the [[genotoxic]] potential of chemical compounds. The test is a colorimetric assay which measures the expression of genes induced by genotoxic agents in ''Escherichia coli'', by means of a fusion with the structural gene for [[β-galactosidase]]. The test is performed over a few hours in columns of a 96-well microplate with increasing concentrations of test samples. This test was developed as a practical complement or alternative to the traditional [[Ames test]] assay for [[genotoxicity]], which involves growing bacteria on agar plates and comparing natural mutation rates to mutation rates of bacteria exposed to potentially mutagenic compounds or samples. The SOS chromotest is comparable in accuracy and sensitivity to established methods such as the Ames test and is a useful tool to screen genotoxic compounds, which could prove carcinogenic in humans, in order to single out chemicals for further in-depth analysis.&lt;ref name="pmid6799816"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mohn GR | title = Bacterial systems for carcinogenicity testing | journal = Mutat. Res. | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–210 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 6799816 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1110(81)90032-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6811893"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Purchase IF | title = International Commission for Protection against Environmental Mutagens and Carcinogens.

As with other bacterial gentoxicity and mutagenicity assays, compounds requiring metabolic activation for activity can be investigated with the addition of S9 microsomal rat liver extract.

==Mechanism==
The [[SOS response]] plays a central role in the response of ''E. coli'' to genotoxic compounds because it responds to a wide array of chemical agents. Triggering of this system can and has been used as an early sign of DNA damage. Two genes play a key role in the SOS response: lexA encodes a repressor for all the genes in the system, and recA encodes a protein able to cleave the LexA repressor upon activation by an SOS inducing signal (caused in this case by the presence of a genotoxic compound). Although the exact mechanism of the SOS response is still unknown, it is induced when DNA lesions perturb or stop DNA replication. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=  Quillardet, Hofnung | title=  The SOS Chromotest: A Review | journal= Mutation Research | year=  1993  | volume = 297| issue = 3| pages= 235–279 | pmid=7692273 | doi=10.1016/0165-1110(93)90019-j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various end-points are possible indicators of the triggering of the SOS system; activation of the RecA protein, cleavage of the LexA repressor, expression of any of the SOS genes, etc. One of the simplest assays consists of monitoring the expression of an SOS gene by means of fusion with lacZ, the structural gene for ''E. coli'' β-galactosidase.

==Procedure==
[[Image:Sos results.png|300px|right|thumb|Overview of the use of the SOS response for genotoxicity testing]]
The SOS chromotest consists of incubating the ''E. coli'' with increasing concentrations of the chemical to be tested. After allowing time for protein synthesis, β-galactosidase activity is assayed using a simple colorimetric assay. By including a lactose analog which yields a colored compound upon degradation, an easily observable or quantifiable change in colour is used as a metric. Since the chemical tested may inhibit protein synthesis at higher concentrations, which would lead to an underestimation of B-galactosidase induction, alkaline phosphatase is assayed simultaneously with β-galactosidase in order to scale the data to survivability of the cells.

The assay can easily be completed in a number of hours. If using a micro-plate reader, the test is quantitative and dose-response curves have an initial linear region. The slope of this linear region allows unequivocal association of each compound with a single parameter, the SOS-inducing potency (SOSIP), which reflects the inducing activity of the compound.&lt;ref name="pmid6821127"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quillardet P, Huisman O, D'Ari R, Hofnung M | title = SOS chromotest, a direct assay of induction of an SOS function in Escherichia coli K-12 to measure genotoxicity | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 79 | issue = 19 | pages = 5971–5 | date = October 1982 | pmid = 6821127 | pmc = 347033 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.79.19.5971 | bibcode = 1982PNAS...79.5971Q | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 
This assay provides both a qualitative (visible observation of colour gradient) for screening purposes, or quantitative measurement (spectrophotometry) for calculation of commonly accepted metrics. In the quantitative assay, the dose-response (colour production linked to beta-galactosidase production) of a compound is plotted, with the slope of the initial linear region used as a universal parameter, the SOS-inducing potency (SOSIP), which reflects the ability of a compound to induce the SOS response (measured indirectly through production of beta-galactosidase and the breakdown of a lactose analog). Typically, the lactose analog is [[X-Gal]], which produces a blue colour when cleaved by beta-galactosidase. The dose response is also scaled by the survival of cells, measured through the breakdown of alkaline phosphatase (which produces a yellow colour), allowing for the calculation of the SOSIP.

Although the SOSIP is a concentration-based metric, the same method can be used for complex environmental mixtures where the concentration or even compounds of interest are unknown. Through the calculation of the intermediate SOS-induction factor (SOSIF), which can be plotted against dilution in the same manner in order to give an illustration of the dose-response without analytical measurements of samples beforehand.

==Advantages==

THE SOS chromotest is considered to be the most simple and rapid short-term test for genotoxicity. It serves as a useful and cost effective complement to the traditional Ames test for a number of reasons. Firstly, because of its simplicity and rapidity, the SOS chromotest may be used as a screening test for a large number of potentially genotoxic compounds. Secondly, it may allow the detection of genotoxic chemicals which yield false negatives in the Ames test (such as estradiol, a compound of growing concern). Thirdly, it can prove an effective method to discriminate false positive results in the Ames test.

SOTIO conducts global operations in [[European countries|Europe]], the [[United States|USA]], and [[China]]. In January 2020, the company announced the founding of its subsidiary SOTIO Biotech AG in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-07-11 |title=Czech PPF Group biotech firms begin trials to extend lives of cancer patients |url=https://english.radio.cz/czech-ppf-group-biotech-firms-begin-trials-extend-lives-cancer-patients-8126262 |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=Radio Prague International |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOTIO also operates laboratory complexes Prague, Czech Republic and [[Beijing]], China where it produces treatments for people suffering from oncological diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=AG |first=BIOCOM |title=Carbios tackles marine littering |url=https://european-biotechnology.com/up-to-date/latest-news/news/carbios-tackles-marine-littering.html?L=0 |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=european-biotechnology.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pipeline ==
SOTIO is currently testing multiple oncology products at different stages of clinical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=SOTIO |first=Biotech |title=SOTIO Biotech Pipeline |url=https://sotio.com/pipeline/sotio-biotech-pipeline |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=Sotio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IL-15 Superagonist ===
Immune cytokine IL-15 is an immuno-oncology target that mobilizes cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Stimulating [[IL-15 receptor]]s on these cells represents a potent and complementary mechanism to existing cancer treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Perera |first1=Pin-Yu |last2=Lichy |first2=Jack H. |last3=Waldmann |first3=Thomas A. |last4=Perera |first4=Liyanage P. |title=The role of Interleukin-15 in inflammation and immune responses to infection: implications for its therapeutic use |journal=Microbes and Infection / Institut Pasteur |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=247–261 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2011.10.006 |issn=1286-4579 |pmc=3270128 |pmid=22064066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOTIO is developing an IL-15 superagonist, SO-C101, which is designed to have significant advantages over other IL-2 and IL-15 based therapies that are currently in development. SO-C101 is fused to the IL-15 alpha chain receptor, which confers specific binding to cytotoxic T cell and NK cells, which may provide superior efficacy and safety profile. Fusion to the IL-15 alpha chain receptor also optimizes half-life, which may improve efficacy by limiting [[T cell#T-cell exhaustion|T cell exhaustion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Developing IL-15 superagonists for cancer therapy |url=https://www.drugtargetreview.com/article/72034/developing-il-15-superagonists-for-cancer-therapy/ |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=Drug Target Review |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOTIO is currently conducting an ongoing Phase 1/1b dose finding study at leading clinical centers in the U.S. and EU to examine SO-C101 as monotherapy and in combination with [[pembrolizumab]] in patients with relapsed/refractory advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Interim data demonstrate that SO-C101 has been well tolerated to date, with no dose limiting toxicities observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Genetically Engineering An IL-15 Superagonist |url=https://www.bioprocessonline.com/doc/genetically-engineering-an-il-superagonist-0001 |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=www.bioprocessonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BOXR ===
SOTIO's BOXR cell therapy platform is designed to improve functionality of engineered T cells by discovering novel “bolt-on” [[transgene]]s that can be co-expressed with tumor-targeting receptors to overcome resistance and improve the function of T cells in the solid tumor [[Tumor microenvironment|microenvironment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=AG |first=BIOCOM |title=Sotio licences Unum Therapeutics' CAR-T cell portfolio |url=https://european-biotechnology.com/up-to-date/latest-news/news/sotio-licences-unum-therapeutics-car-t-cell-portfolio.html |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=european-biotechnology.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead candidate BOXR1030 uniquely combines the BOXR-discovered GOT2 transgene, a critical enzyme involved in cellular metabolism, with CAR T technology. BOXR1030 is designed to improve CAR T therapy function in the microenvironment by enhancing T cell fitness in the solid tumor microenvironment. Tumor infiltrating [[lymphocyte]]s isolated from the tumors of treated animals revealed that BOXR1030 cells were more resistant to dysfunction and had fewer markers of exhaustion as compared to the control CAR T cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Personalized cell therapies offer hope for some of the toughest cancers |url=https://www.scienceboard.net/index.aspx?sec=ser&amp;sub=def&amp;pag=dis&amp;ItemID=2865 |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=ScienceBoard.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antibody Drug Conjugates ===
SOTIO, in collaboration with its partner [[NBE Therapeutic]]s, is developing oncology candidates based on its platform of potent and highly stable ADCs with an unprecedented therapeutic window. Preclinical data show that these ADCs have a strong efficacy in direct tumor cell killing and a good tolerability profile, but in addition, also induce specific antitumor immunity, thereby providing a dual approach to cancer protection. SOTIO currently has two antibody drug conjugate candidates in preclinical trials, SOT102 and SOT107.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=SOTIO, NBE Therapeutics Collaborate |url=http://www.technologynetworks.com/cancer-research/news/sotio-nbe-therapeutics-collaborate-209829 |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=Cancer Research from Technology Networks |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=New partner and investor for NBE Therapeutics |url=https://www.startupticker.ch/en/news/november-2016/new-partner-and-investor-for-nbe-therapeutics |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=www.startupticker.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners ==
SOTIO has its own scientific research and development and also collaborates with other partners. In recent years, SOTIO and PPF have focused on investing in a number of biotechnology companies developing innovative anticancer treatments in Europe and the US.

'''Spatial transcriptomics''' is a method for assigning cell types (identified by the mRNA readouts) to their locations in the histological sections. This method can also be used to determine subcellular localization of mRNA molecules. The term is a variation of [[Genomics|Spatial Genomics]], first described by Doyle, et al., in 2000 &lt;ref name="patent7613571"&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=7613571|title=Method and system for the multidimensional morphological reconstruction of genome expression activity|pubdate=2009-11-03| inventor = Doyle MD, Pescitelli Jr MJ, Williams BS, Michaels GS }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then expanded upon by Ståhl et al. in a technique&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; developed in 2016, which has since undergone a variety of improvements and modifications.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ståhl PL, Salmén F, Vickovic S, Lundmark A, Navarro JF, Magnusson J, Giacomello S, Asp M, Westholm JO, Huss M, Mollbrink A, Linnarsson S, Codeluppi S, Borg Å, Pontén F, Costea PI, Sahlén P, Mulder J, Bergmann O, Lundeberg J, Frisén J | display-authors = 6 | title = Visualization and analysis of gene expression in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics | journal = Science | volume = 353 | issue = 6294 | pages = 78–82 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27365449 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaf2403 | s2cid = 30942685 | bibcode = 2016Sci...353...78S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Ståhl method&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; implies positioning individual tissue samples on the arrays of spatially barcoded reverse transcription primers able to capture mRNA with the {{not a typo|oligo(dT)}} tails.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; Besides {{not a typo|oligo(dT)}} tail and spatial barcode, which indicates the x and y position on the arrayed slide, the probe contains a cleavage site, amplification and sequencing handle, and [[unique molecular identifier]].&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; Commonly, histological samples are cut using [[cryotome]], then fixed, stained, and put on the microarrays.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; After that, it undergoes enzymatic permeabilization, so that molecules can diffuse down to the slide, with further mRNA release and binding to the probes.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; Reverse transcription is then carried out ''in situ''.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; As a result, spatially marked complementary DNA is synthesized, providing information about gene expression in the exact location of the sample.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; Thus, described protocol combines paralleled sequencing and staining of the same sample.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; It is important to mention that the first generation of the arrayed slides comprised about 1,000 spots of the 100-μm diameter, limiting resolution to ~10-40 cells per spot.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt;
 
In the broader meaning of this term, spatial transcriptomics includes methods that can be divided into five principal approaches&lt;ref name="Asp_2020"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Asp M, Bergenstråhle J, Lundeberg J | title = Spatially Resolved Transcriptomes-Next Generation Tools for Tissue Exploration | journal = BioEssays | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = e1900221 | date = October 2020 | pmid = 32363691 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201900221 | s2cid = 218492475 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; to resolving spatial distribution of transcripts. They are microdissection techniques, Fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization methods, ''in situ'' sequencing, ''in situ'' capture protocols and ''in silico'' approaches.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt;

'''Application'''

Defining the spatial distribution of mRNA molecules allows for the experimentalist to uncover cellular heterogeneity in tissues, tumours, immune cells as well as determine the subcellular distribution of transcripts in various conditions.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt; This information provides a unique opportunity to decipher both the cellular and subcellular architecture in both tissues and individual cells. These methodologies provide crucial insights in the fields of embryology, oncology, immunology and histology.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt; The functioning of the individual cells in multicellular organisms can only be completely explained in the context of identifying their exact location in the body.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt; Spatial transcriptomics techniques sought to elucidate cells’ properties this way. Below, we look into the methods that connect gene expression to the spatial organization of  cells.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt;

=== smFISH ===
One of the first techniques able to achieve spatially resolved RNA profiling of individual cells was &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ingle-&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;olecule &lt;u&gt;f&lt;/u&gt;luorescent ''&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;n &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;itu'' &lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;ybridization (smFISH).&lt;ref name="Femino_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Femino AM, Fay FS, Fogarty K, Singer RH | title = Visualization of single RNA transcripts in situ | journal = Science | volume = 280 | issue = 5363 | pages = 585–90 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9554849 | doi = 10.1126/science.280.5363.585 | bibcode = 1998Sci...280..585F }}&lt;/ref&gt; It implemented short (50 base pairs) oligonucleotide probes conjugated with 5 fluorophores which could bind to a specific transcript yielding bright spots in the sample.&lt;ref name="Femino_1998" /&gt; Detection of these spots provides quantitative information about expression of certain genes in the cell.&lt;ref name="Femino_1998" /&gt; However, usage of probes labeled with multiple fluorophores was challenged by self-quenching, altered hybridization characteristics, their synthesis and purification.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt;

Later, this method was changed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raj A, van den Bogaard P, Rifkin SA, van Oudenaarden A, Tyagi S | title = Imaging individual mRNA molecules using multiple singly labeled probes | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 877–9 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18806792 | pmc = 3126653 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by substituting the above described probes with those of 20 bp length, coupled to only one fluorophore and complementary in tandem to an mRNA sequence of interest, meaning that those would collectively bind to the targeted mRNA. One such probe itself wouldn't produce a strong signal, but the cumulative fluorescence of the congregated probes would show a bright spot. Since single misbound probes are unlikely to co-localize, false-positive signals in this method are limited.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt;

Thus, this ''in situ'' hybridization (ISH) technique spots spatial localization of RNA expression via direct imaging of individual RNA molecules in single cells.

=== RNAscope ===
Another ''in situ'' hybridization technique termed RNAscope employs probes of the specific Z-shaped design to simultaneously amplify hybridization signals and suppress background noise.&lt;ref name="Wang_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang F, Flanagan J, Su N, Wang LC, Bui S, Nielson A, Wu X, Vo HT, Ma XJ, Luo Y | display-authors = 6 | title = RNAscope: a novel in situ RNA analysis platform for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues | journal = The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22166544 | pmc = 3338343 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2011.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most steps of RNAScope are similar to the classic ISH protocol.&lt;ref name="Wang_2012" /&gt; The tissue sample is fixed onto slides and then treated with RNAscope reagents that permeate the cells. Z-probes are designed in a way that they are only effective when bound in pairs to the target sequence.&lt;ref name="Wang_2012" /&gt; This allows another element of this method (preamplifier) to connect to the top tails of Z-probes.&lt;ref name="Wang_2012" /&gt; Once affixed, preamplifier serves as a binding site for other elements: amplifiers which in turn bind to another type of probes: label probes.&lt;ref name="Wang_2012" /&gt; As a result, a bulky structure is formed on the target sequence. Most importantly, the preamplifier fails to bind to a singular Z-probe, thus, nonspecific binding wouldn't entail signal emission, thus, eliminating background noise mentioned in the beginning.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang_2012" /&gt;

== ''in situ'' capture ==
=== Spatial transcriptomics ===

[https://nanostring.com/research-focus/spatial-transcriptomics/ Spatial Transcriptomics] is the ability to capture the positional context of transcriptional activity within intact tissue, either for regions or single cells.

When a tissue [[Frozen section procedure|cryosection]] is attached to a spatial transcriptomic slide the barcoded primers bind and capture adjacent mRNAs from the tissue. While the tissue section is attached to the slide, reverse transcription of captured mRNA is initiated and the resulting [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] incorporates the spatial barcode of the primer. Following mRNA capture and reverse transcription, sequencing libraries are prepared and analyzed with [[Illumina dye sequencing]]. The spatial barcode present within each generated sequence allows the data for each individual mRNA transcript to be mapped back to its point of origin within the tissue section.

=== 10X Visium ===
The 10X Visium assay is a newer and improved version of the Spatial Transcriptomics assay. It also utilizes spotted arrays of mRNA-capturing probes on the surface of glass slides but with increased spot number, minimized spot size and increased amount of capture probes per spot. Within each of the four capture areas of the Visium Spatial Gene Expression slides, there are approximately 5000 barcoded spots, which in turn contain millions of spatially barcoded capture oligonucleotides. Tissue mRNA is released upon permeabilization and binds to the barcoded oligos, enabling capture of gene expression information. Each barcoded spot is 55&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter, and the distance from the center of one spot to the center of another is approximately 100&amp;nbsp;µm. The spots are staggered to minimize the distance between them. On average, mRNA from anywhere between 1 and 10 cells are captured per spot which provides near single-cell resolution.

''in situ'' hybridization was developed in the late 60's and saw major developments in the 80's (smFISH) and 10's (RNAscope, seqFISH, MERFISH and osmFISH) with the most recent additions being seqFISH+ and DNA microscopy.&lt;ref name="Chen_2917"/&gt; Microdisecction techniques were first developed in the late 90's (Laser Capture Microdissection) and the most recent addition was in 2016 with the development of ProximID.&lt;ref name="Asp_2020" /&gt; Spatial genomics/transcriptomics as a technique was invented and developed in 2000 by Michael Doyle (of [[Eolas]]), Maurice Pescitelli (of the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]), Betsey Williams (of [[Harvard]]), and George Michaels (of [[George Mason University]]),&lt;ref name="patent7613571" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=7894997|pubdate=2011-02-22| inventor = Doyle MD, Pescitelli Jr MJ, Williams BS,  Michaels GS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=10011864|pubdate=2018-07-03|assign=Eolas Technologies Inc.| inventor = Doyle MD, Pescitelli Jr MJ, Williams BS, Michaels GS }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Visible Embryo Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doyle MD, Noe A, Michaels GS | title = The Visible Embryo Project: A Platform for Spatial Genomics | journal = Proceedings of SPIE | volume = 3905 | date = 2000 | page = 248 | doi = 10.1117/12.384880 | bibcode = 2000SPIE.3905..248D | s2cid = 85027703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later expanded upon in 2016 by Jonas Frisén, Joakim Lundeberg, Patrik Ståhl and their colleagues in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="Ståhl_2016" /&gt; In 2019 at the [[Broad Institute]], the labs of Fei Chen and Evan Macosko developed Slide-seq, which used barcoded oligos on beads.&lt;ref name="Rodriques_2019"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriques SG, Stickels RR, Goeva A, Martin CA, Murray E, Vanderburg CR, Welch J, Chen LM, Chen F, Macosko EZ | display-authors = 6 | title = Slide-seq: A scalable technology for measuring genome-wide expression at high spatial resolution | journal = Science | volume = 363 | issue = 6434 | pages = 1463–1467 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30923225 | pmc = 6927209 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaw1219 | bibcode = 2019Sci...363.1463R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and common characteristics==

Medications must be either identified as high cost, high complexity or high touch to be classified as a specialty medication by Magellan Rx Management.&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://magellanrx.com/member/external/commercial/common/doc/en-us/MRx_Formulary_Specialty.pdf | title=Specialty Pharmacy Drug List | publisher=Magellan RX Management | date=2015 | access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialty pharmaceuticals are defined as "high-cost oral or injectable medications used to treat complex chronic conditions".&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt; According to a 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of Managed Care &amp; Specialty Pharmacy]]'', on the increasingly important role of specialty drugs in the treatment of chronic conditions and their cost, drugs are most typically defined as specialty because they are expensive.&lt;ref name="ncbi_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Health plan utilization and costs of specialty drugs within 4 chronic conditions | journal=Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy | date=September 2013 |volume=19 |number=7 |pages=542–8 | author1=Gleason, Alexander G. C. | author2=Starner, C. I. | author3=Ritter, S. T. | author4=Van Houten, H. K. | author5=Gunderson, B. W. | author6=Shah, N. D. |pmid=23964615 | doi=10.18553/jmcp.2013.19.7.542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criteria used to define a drug as specialty include "biologic drugs, the need to inject or infuse the drug, the requirement for special handling, or drug availability only via a limited distribution network".&lt;ref name="ncbi_2013" /&gt; The price of specialty drugs compared to non-specialty drugs is very high, "more than $1,000 per 30-day supply".&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_2015_07_16" /&gt;

Specialty drugs cover over forty therapeutic categories and special disease states with over 500 drugs.&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt;

Vogenberg claims that there is no standard definition of a specialty drug which is one of the reasons they are difficult to manage.&lt;ref name="workforce.com" /&gt; "[T]hose pharmaceuticals that usually require special handling, administration, unique inventory management, and a high level of patient monitoring and support to consumers with specific chronic conditions, acute events, or complex therapies, and provides comprehensive patient education services and coordination with the patient and prescriber."&lt;ref name="URAC" /&gt;

===High cost===
Drugs are most typically defined as specialty because they are expensive.&lt;ref name="ncbi_2013" /&gt; They are high cost "both in total and on a per-patient basis".&lt;ref name="pppmag_2014" /&gt; High-cost medications are typically priced at more than $1,000 per 30-day supply.&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_2015_07_16" /&gt; The Medicare Part D program "defines a specialty drug as one that costs more than $600 per month".&lt;ref name="pppmag_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="serono"&gt;{{citation |work=EMD Serono |series=EMD Serono Specialty Digest |edition=10 |title=Managed Care Strategies for Specialty Pharmaceuticals|date= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the prescriptions filled by Pennsylvania-licensed [[Philidor Rx Services]], a specialty online mail-order pharmacy, which mainly sold&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015_10_29"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-29/valeant-sales-web-emerged-after-druggist-flagged-mystery-scripts | title=The Tiny Pharmacy at the Center of Valeant's Money Mystery | publisher=Bloomberg | date=29 October 2015 | access-date=1 November 2015 | author1=Langreth, Robert | author2=Deprez, Esmé E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015_Armstrong"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-30/valeant-says-it-s-cutting-ties-with-troubled-pharmacy-philidor | title=Valeant Says It's Cutting Ties With Troubled Pharmacy Philidor | publisher=Bloomberg | date=30 October 2015 | access-date=31 October 2015 | author1=Armstrong, Drew | author2=Kitamura, Makiko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="financialpost_2015_10_30"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/global-investor/valeant-pharmaceuticals-international-inc-cuts-ties-with-philidor-as-business-practice-controversy-grows | title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc cuts ties with Philidor as business practice controversy grows | work=Bloomberg News | date=30 October 2015 |access-date=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals|Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc]] expensive drugs directly to patients and handled insurance claims on the customers' behalf,&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/philidor-valeant-consumer-complaints-2015-10 | title=The secret firm at the heart of Valeant's crisis has an alleged history of shady behavior with customers | work=Business Insider | date=23 October 2015 | access-date=1 November 2015 | author=Lopez, Linette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="troubling_RX"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.pressreader.com/usa/los-angeles-times/20151101/282037621032574/TextView |title=A Troubling RX |author1=Peterson, Melody |author2=Pfeifer, Stuart |date=1 November 2015 |access-date=1 November 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Solodyn]], [[Jublia]],&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ_2015_10_29"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/valeant-countersues-r-o-pharmacy-1446176996 | title=Valeant Countersues R&amp;O Pharmacy Billing dispute draws attention to drug maker's work with specialty pharmacies | date=29 October 2015 | access-date=1 November 2015 | author=Rapoport, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valeant"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ir.valeant.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-release-details/2014/Valeant-Pharmaceuticals-Announces-FDA-Approval-Of-Jublia-for-the-Treatment-of-Onychomycosis/default.aspx | title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals Announces FDA Approval Of Jublia® for the Treatment of Onychomycosis | work=Valeant Pharmaceuticals | date=9 June 2014 | access-date=1 November 2015 | location=Laval, Quebec | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108032544/http://ir.valeant.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-release-details/2014/Valeant-Pharmaceuticals-Announces-FDA-Approval-Of-Jublia-for-the-Treatment-of-Onychomycosis/default.aspx | archive-date=8 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tretinoin]], would be considered specialty drugs.&lt;ref name="valeant_retin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ir.valeant.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-release-details/2014/Valeant-Pharmaceuticals-Announces-Approval-of-Retin-A-Micro-Microsphere-008/default.aspx | title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals Announces Approval of Retin-A Micro® Microsphere 0.08% | work=Valeant Pharmaceuticals | date=31 January 2014 | access-date=1 November 2015 | location=Laval, Quebec | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215210428/http://ir.valeant.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-release-details/2014/Valeant-Pharmaceuticals-Announces-Approval-of-Retin-A-Micro-Microsphere-008/default.aspx | archive-date=15 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High complexity===
Specialty drugs are more complex to manufacture.&lt;ref name="pppmag_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pppmag.com/article_print.php?articleid=1637 | title=The Increasing Impact of High-Cost Specialty Therapies | date=2014 | access-date=27 October 2015 | author=Lucio, Steven | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208051829/http://www.pppmag.com/article_print.php?articleid=1637 | archive-date=8 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are "highly complex medications, typically biology-based, that structurally mimic compounds found within the body".&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt; Specialty drugs are often biologics&lt;ref name="ncbi_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="workforce.com" /&gt;—"drugs derived from living cells"—but biologics are "not always deemed to be specialty drugs".&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44132.pdf | title=Specialty Drugs: Background and Policy Concerns | publisher=Congressional Research Service | date=3 August 2015 | access-date=27 October 2015 | author=Kirchhoff, Suzanne M. | pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologics "may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting-edge technologies. Gene-based and cellular biologics, for example, often are at the forefront of biomedical research, and may be used to treat a variety of medical conditions for which no other treatments are available."&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt;

{{quote|"In contrast to most drugs that are chemically synthesized and their structure is known, most biologics are complex mixtures that are not easily identified or characterized. Biological products, including those manufactured by biotechnology, tend to be heat sensitive and susceptible to microbial contamination. Therefore, it is necessary to use aseptic principles from initial manufacturing steps, which is also in contrast to most conventional drugs. Biological products often represent the cutting-edge of biomedical research and, in time, may offer the most effective means to treat a variety of medical illnesses and conditions that presently have no other treatments available."|U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}

According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) biologics, or&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/ucm133077.htm | title=What Are "Biologics" Questions and Answers | publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date=5 August 2015 | access-date=11 October 2015 | location=Silver Spring, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Biological products include a wide range of products such as vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapy, tissues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins. Biologics can be composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances, or may be living entities such as cells and tissues. Biologics are isolated from a variety of natural sources—human, animal, or microorganism..."|U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}

===[[High-touch|High touch]]===
Some specialty drugs can be oral medications or self-administered injectables. Others may be professionally administered or injectables/infusions.&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt; High-touch patient care management is usually required to control side effects and ensure compliance. Specialized handling and distribution are also necessary to ensure appropriate medication administration.&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt; Specialty drugs patient care management is meant to be both high technology and high touch care, or [[patient-centered care]] with "more face-to-face time, more personal connections". Patient-centered care is defined by the [[Institute of Medicine]] as "care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost_Dec_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-rosen-md/health-care-technology_b_2285712.html | title=High Tech, High Touch: Why Technology Enhances Patient-Centered Care | date=13 December 2012 | access-date=5 October 2015 | author=Rosen, Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialty drugs may be "difficult for patients to take without ongoing clinical support".&lt;ref name="pppmag_2014" /&gt;

===Limited availability===
Specialty drugs might have special requirements for handling procedures and administration including the necessity of having controlled environments such as highly specific temperature controls to ensure product integrity.&lt;ref name="pppmag_2014" /&gt; They are often only available via a limited distributions network such as a special pharmacy.&lt;ref name="ncbi_2013" /&gt; Specialty drugs may be "challenging for providers to manage".&lt;ref name="pppmag_2014" /&gt;

===Rare and complex diseases===

Specialty drugs may be taken "by relatively small patient populations presenting with complex medical conditions".&lt;ref name="pppmag_2014" /&gt;

==History==

"Specialty pharmacies have their roots in the 1970s, when they began delivering temperature-controlled drugs to treat cancer, HIV, infertility and hemophilia."&lt;ref name="bloomberg_2015_Valeant"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Valeant's Favorite Pharmacy Made Life Easy for Doctors, at a Price: Why Valeant Is an Unusual Pharmaceutical Ethics Case|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/pharmacies-like-philidor-make-life-easy-for-doctors-at-a-price|website = Bloomberg.com|access-date = 23 January 2016 |date=12 November 2015 |first1 = Michelle Fay |last1=Cortez |first2=John|last2 = Lauerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The business grew as more drugs became available for patients to inject themselves and as insurers sought to manage expenses for patients with chronic conditions, according to areport from IMS Health. Manufacturers have increasingly relied on these pharmacies when it comes to fragile medicines that need special handling or have potentially dangerous side effects that require them to be taken under a management program."|Bloomberg 2015}}

According to ''[[The American Journal of Managed Care]]'', in 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market.&lt;ref name="AJMC_2013"/&gt; According to the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], by the mid-1990s, there were fewer than 30 specialty drugs on the market, but by 2008 that number had increased to 200.&lt;ref name="ncbi_2008" /&gt;

Specialty drugs may also be designated as orphan drugs or ultra-orphan drugs under the U. S. [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]]. This was enacted to facilitate development of orphan drugs—drugs for rare diseases such as [[Huntington's disease]], [[myoclonus]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[muscular dystrophy]] which affect small numbers of individuals residing in the United States.&lt;ref name="GPO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-96/pdf/STATUTE-96-Pg2049.pdf | title=Orphan Drug Act of 1983 | work=US Food and Drug Administration | date=4 January 1983 | access-date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all specialty drugs are orphan drugs. According to [[Thomson Reuters]] in their 2012 publication "The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs", there has been increased investing in [[orphan drug]] research and development partly since the U.S. Congress enacted the Orphan Drug Act, giving an extra monopoly for drugs for "orphan diseases" that affected fewer than 200,000 people in the country.&lt;ref name="Forbes_2010" /&gt; Similar acts came into existence in other regions of the world, many driven by "high-profile philanthropic funding".&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |title=The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs |work=Thomson Reuters |year=2012 |access-date=29 June 2015 |author1=Laura Gaze|author2=Jennifer Breen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.drugdiscoverytoday.com/download/900 |title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D |date=15 August 2012 |access-date=29 June 2015 |author1=Kiran N.

The term ''specialty drugs'' was used as early as 1988 in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article about [[Eastman Kodak Company]]'s acquisition of the New York-based [[Sterling Drug|Sterling Drug Inc.]], maker of specialty drugs along with many and diverse other products.&lt;ref name="nytimes_1988" /&gt; When [[Shire (pharmaceutical company)|Shire Pharmaceuticals]] acquired BioChem Pharma in 2000 they created a specialty pharmaceuticals company.&lt;ref name="CBC_2000"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/biochem-pharma-agrees-to-13-billion-merger-1.241450 | title=BioChem Pharma agrees to $13-billion merger | publisher=CBC News | date=11 December 2000 | access-date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2001 Shire was one of the fastest growing specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world.&lt;ref name="shire_2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://investors.shire.com/~/media/Files/S/Shire-IR/annual-interim-reports/archive/2001ukgaapaccountsweb.pdf | title=Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2001 | work=Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc | date=2001 | access-date=17 October 2015 | pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|108|173}}, {{USStat|117|2066}}&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/01_Overview.asp |title=Medicare Modernization Act Update - Overview |publisher=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] |access-date=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the largest overhaul of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the public health program's 38-year history—included [[Medicare Part D]] an [[entitlement]] benefit for [[prescription drug]]s, through tax breaks and subsidies. In 2004 the U. S. [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) prepared a report on final guidance regarding access to drug coverage enacted under in which they included the specialty drugs tier in the prescription drug formulary.&lt;ref name="CMS_strategy_2004"&gt;{{citation |title=Formulary Guidance |series=Medicare Modernization Act Final Guidelines - Formularies CMS Strategy for Affordable Access to Comprehensive Drug Coverage- Guidelines for Reviewing Prescription Drug Plan Formularies and Procedures|url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovContra/downloads/FormularyGuidance.pdf |date=2004 |access-date=22 January 2016 |location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time CMS guidelines included four tiers: tier 1 includes preferred generics, tier 2 includes preferred brands, tier 3 includes non-preferred brands and generics and tier 4 included specialty drugs.&lt;ref name="CMS_strategy_2004" /&gt; By January 1, 2006, the controversial{{According to whom|date=January 2017}} [[Medicare Part D]] was put in effect.

By 2008 most prescription medication plans in the United States used specialty drug tiers, and some had a separate benefit tier for injectable drugs. Beneficiary cost sharing was higher for drugs in these tiers.&lt;ref name="kff_2008"&gt;{{citation |author1=Elizabeth Hargrave |author2=Jack Hoadley |author3=Katie Merrelli |author4= Juliette Cubansk |url=http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7711.pdf |title=Medicare Part D 2008 Data Spotlight: Specialty tiers |work=The Kaiser Family Foundation |date=December 2007 |access-date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011 in the United States a growing number of Medicare Part D health insurance plans—which normally include generic, preferred, and non-preferred tiers with an accompanying rate of cost-sharing or co-payment—had added an "additional tier for high-cost drugs which is referred to as a specialty tier".&lt;ref name="uthsc_2011"&gt;{{cite thesis | url=http://etd.uthsc.edu/WORLD-ACCESS/Elias/2011-030-Elias.pdf | title=Analysis of out-of-pocket expenditures of oral oncologics for Tennessee recipients of Medicare Part D | date=May 2011 | access-date=17 October 2015 | author=Elias, Eve Carolyn | pages=54 | work=The University of Tennessee | series=Master of Science | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131002221/http://etd.uthsc.edu/WORLD-ACCESS/Elias/2011-030-Elias.pdf | archive-date=31 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS)===
{{Main|Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies}}
On September 27, 2007 President [[George W. Bush]] amended the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]] (FDAAA) to authorize the FDA to require [[Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies]] (REMS) on medications if necessary to minimize the risks associated with some drugs". These medications were designated as specialty drugs and required specialty pharmacies. When the FDA approves a new drug they may require a REMS program which "may contain any combination of 5 criteria: Medication Guide, Communication Plan, Elements to Assure Safe Use, Implementation System, and Timetable for Submission of Assessments".&lt;ref name="RX_Wiki"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rx-wiki.org/index.php?title=Risk_evaluation_and_mitigation_strategies | title=Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies | publisher=RX Wiki | date=10 February 2015 | access-date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In 2010, 48% of all new molecular entities, and 60% of all new specialty drug approvals, required a REMS program." Risk-reduction mechanisms can include the "use of specialized distribution partners", special pharmacy.&lt;ref name="pharmaceuticalcommerce"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/brand_communications?articleid=2389%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank | title=With a Few Stumbles, REMS Begins to Hit Its Stride | work=Pharmaceutical Commerce | date=22 April 2011 | access-date=5 November 2015 | author=Shelley, Suzanne | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129174603/http://www.pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/brand_communications?articleid=2389%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank | archive-date=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough therapy===

In 2013 the FDA introduced the [[breakthrough therapy]] designation program which cut the development process of new therapies by several years. This meant that the FDA could "introduce important medicines to the market based on very promising phase 2 rather than phase 3 clinical trial results". Shortly after the law was enacted, [[Ivacaftor]], in January 2013, became the first drug to receive the breakthrough therapy designation.&lt;ref name="ahdbonline"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ahdbonline.com/issues/2014/march-2014-volume-7-special-feature-fifth-annual-payers-guide-to-new-fda-approvals/1704-specialty-drugs-top-the-trends-in-the-2014-pipeline | title=Specialty Drugs Top the Trends in the 2014 Pipeline Special Feature Fifth Annual Payers' Guide to New FDA Approvals | work=American Health &amp; Drug Benefits via Engage Healthcare Communications, LLC.

===Trends in spending in the United States===
According to Express Scripts,&lt;ref name="Express_Scripts_2014" /&gt; 
{{quote|"[T]he pharmacy landscape [in the United States] underwent a seismic change, and the budgetary impact to healthcare payers was significant. U.S. prescription drug spend increased 13.1% in 2014 – the largest annual increase since 2003 – and this was largely driven by an unprecedented 30.9% increase in spending on specialty medications. Utilization of traditional medications stayed flat (-0.1%), while the use of specialty drugs increased 5.8%. The largest factors contributing to the increased spending, however, were the price increases for these medication categories – 6.5% for traditional and 25.2% for specialty. While specialty medications represent only 1% of all U.S. prescriptions, these medications represented 31.8% of all 2014 drug spend – an increase from 27.7% in 2013."|Express Scripts Drug Trend Report}}

By 2015 "specialty medications account for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years, according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_2015_07_16" /&gt; The specialty pharmacy business had $20 billion in sales in 2005. By 2014 it had grown to "$78 billion in sales".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_2015_07_16" /&gt; In Canada by 2013 "specialty drugs made up less than 1.3 percent of all Canadian prescriptions, but accounted for 24 percent of Canada's total spending on prescription drugs".&lt;ref name="express-scripts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.express-scripts.ca/news-room/specialty-drug-spend-unsustainable-according-express-scripts-canadas-drug-trend | title=Specialty Drug Spend Unsustainable According to Express Scripts Canada's Drug Trend Report Employers May Become Unable to Afford Comprehensive Employee Drug Benefits | date=28 May 2014 | access-date=5 October 2015 | location=Mississauga, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Randy Vogenberg of the [[Institute for Integrated Healthcare]] in Massachusetts and a co-leader of the Midwest Business Group initiative, began investigating specialty drugs in 2003, it "wasn't showing up on the radar". By 2009 specialty drugs had started doubling in cost and payers such as employers began to question.&lt;ref name="workforce.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.workforce.com/articles/specialty-drugs-appearing-as-the-next-wave-of-health-care-costs | title=Specialty Drugs Appearing as the Next Wave of Health Care Costs | publisher=Workforce | date=28 September 2012 | access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogenberg observed that by 2014 health care reform had changed the landscape for specialty drugs. There is a shift away from a marketplace based on a predominately clinical perspective, to one that puts economics first and clinical second.&lt;ref name="IMS_Health_commercial_2014" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

Many factors contribute to the continuing increase in price of specialty drugs.  Development of specialty drugs not only costs more, but they also take longer to develop than other large market pharmaceuticals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mailankody|first1=Sham|last2=Prasad|first2=Vinay|date=2016-07-19|title=Implications of Proposed Medicare Reforms to Counteract High Cancer Drug Prices|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=316|issue=3|pages=271–272|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.5998|pmid=27149663|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Drug development]]).

Due to this lack of competition, policies that serve to limit prices in other markets can be ineffective or even counter-productive when applied to specialty drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Huntington|first1=Scott F.|last2=Davidoff|first2=Amy J.|date=2016-11-14|title=High-Cost, High-Value Oral Specialty Drugs: More Evidence on the Impact of Cost Sharing in Medicare Part D|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|volume=34|issue=36|pages=4307–4309|doi=10.1200/jco.2016.70.2738|pmid=27998230|issn=0732-183X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High prices for specialty drugs are a problem for both patients and payers.

===Insurance payer definition===

In the United States, private insurance payers will favour a lower-cost agent preferring generics and biosimilars to the more expensive specialty drugs if there is no peer-reviewed or evidence-based justification for them.&lt;ref name="IMS_Health_commercial_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imshealth.com/imshealth/Global/Content/Corporate/Press%20Room/IMS_Health_in_the_News/PharmaVOICE_2_2014_SpecialtyDrugs.PDF | title=Specialty Drugs: an evolving commercial model | publisher=IMS Health | date=February 2014 | access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 report by [[Sun Life Financial]] the average cost of specialty drug claims was $10,753 versus $185 for non-specialty drugs and the cost of specialty drugs continues to rise. With such steep prices by 2012 specialty drugs represented 15-20% of prescription drug reimbursement claims.&lt;ref name="Sun_Life_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cecorner.ca/lessons/A%20Discusson%20about%20Specialty%20Drugs%20(GB00210-E-03-14)%20-%20Final.pdf | title=A Discussion about Specialty Drugs | publisher=Sun Life Financial | date=2012 | access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patient advocacy groups that lobby for payment for specialty drugs include the [[Alliance for Patient Access]] (AfPA), formed in 2006 and which according to a 2014 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' "represents physicians and is largely funded by the pharmaceutical industry. The contributors mostly include brand-name drug makers and biotechs, but some—such as Pfizer and Amgen—are also developing biosimilars."&lt;ref name="wsj_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/08/15/physician-groups-side-with-big-drug-makers-over-biosimilar-names/ | title=Physician Groups Side With Big Drug Makers Over Biosimilar Names | work=Wall Street Journal | date=15 August 2014 | access-date=17 October 2015 | author=Silverman, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 AfPA director [[David Charles (physician)|David Charles]] published an article on specialty drugs in which he agreed with the findings of the [[Congressional Budget Office]] that spending on prescription medications "saves costs in other areas of healthcare spending".&lt;ref name="thehill_2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/189989-making-high-value-specialty-drugs-affordable-will-save-lives | title=Making high-value specialty drugs affordable will save lives and reduce healthcare costs | work=The Hill | date=13 November 2013 | access-date=17 October 2015 | author=Charles, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that specialty drugs are so high priced that many patients do not fill prescriptions resulting in more serious health problems increasing. His article referred to specialty drugs such as "new cancer drugs specially formulated for patients with specific genetic markers".&lt;ref name="thehill_2013" /&gt; He explained the high cost of these "individualized medications based on diagnostic testing; and "biologics", or medicines created through biologic processes, rather than chemically synthesized like most pharmaceuticals".&lt;ref name="thehill_2013" /&gt; He argued that there should be a slight increase in co-pays for the more commonly using lower-tier medications to allow a lower co-pay for those who "require high-cost specialty tier medications".&lt;ref name="thehill_2013" /&gt;

===Top specialty therapy classes and average prescription costs===

According to the 2014 Express Scripts Drug Trend Report,&lt;ref name="Express_Scripts_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lab.express-scripts.com/drug-trend-report/ | title=Highest increase in U.S. drug spend over past decade | publisher=Express Scripts | date=2014 | access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most significant increase in prescription drugs in the United States in 2014 was due to "increased inflation and utilization of hepatitis C and compounded medications".&lt;ref name="Express_Scripts_2014" /&gt; "Excluding those two therapy classes, overall drug spend would have increased only 6.4%.&lt;ref name="Express_Scripts_2014" /&gt;

The cost of "the top three specialty therapy classes—inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis and oncology—contributed 55.9% of the spend for all specialty medications billed through the pharmacy benefit in 2014. The U.S. spent 742.6% more on hepatitis C medications in 2014 than it did in 2013; this therapy class was not among the top 10 specialty classes in 2013.&lt;ref name="Express_Scripts_2014" /&gt;

==Specialty pharmacies==

As the market demanded specialization in drug distribution and clinical management of complex therapies, specialized pharma (SP) evolved.&lt;ref name="UofW"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://courses.washington.edu/pharm542/Week4/slidesSpecialty%20Pharmacy%20%20Managed%20Care%20Strategies%200410.pdf | title=Specialty Pharmacy Managed Care Strategies | access-date=24 September 2015 | author=Murphy, Chad O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2001 [[CVS Health|CVS]]' specialty pharmacy ProCare was the "largest integrated retail/mail provider of specialty pharmacy services" in the United States.&lt;ref name="cvshealth_2001"/&gt;{{rp|10}} It was consolidated with their pharmacy benefit management company, PharmaCare in 2002 to In their 2001 annual report CVS anticipated that the "$16 billion specialty pharmacy market" would grow at "an even faster rate than traditional pharmacy due in large part to the robust pipeline of biotechnology drugs".&lt;ref name="cvshealth_2001"/&gt; By 2014 CVS Caremark, [[Express Scripts]] and [[Walgreens]] represented more than 50% of the specialty drug market in the United States.&lt;ref name="imshealth"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The [[specialty pharmacy]] business had $20 billion in sales in 2005. By 2014 it had grown to "$78 billion in sales".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_2015_07_16" /&gt;

Specialty pharmacies came into existence to as a result of unmet needs. According to the [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] the "primary goals of specialty pharmacies are to ensure the appropriate use of medications, maximize drug adherence, enhance patient satisfaction through direct interaction with healthcare professionals, minimize cost impact, and optimize pharmaceutical care outcomes and delivery of information".&lt;ref name="NCCN_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | title=NCCN Task Force Report: specialty pharmacy |volume=8 | journal= Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network| date=2010 | author1=Schwartz, R.

Specialty pharmaceuticals or biologics are a significant part of the treatment market, yet there is still additional work that should be done to manage costs.&amp;nbsp; Defining biologics has been described as a matter of perspective, with variation between chemists, physicians, payers, microbiologists and regulators.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Morrow, T., (2004). "Five Steps to Managing Biologics." ''Biotechnology Healthcare'', March: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;A payer may define a biologic by cost, while a biochemist may look at composition and structure and a provider at means of delivery or action on the body.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;The FDA generally defines biologics as, "a wide range of products [that] ...can be composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances, or may be living entities such as cells and tissues. Biologics are isolated from a variety of natural sources—human, animal, or microorganism—and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting-edge technologies".&lt;ref&gt;Food and Drug Administration, (2015). "What Are "Biologics" Questions and Answers." ''www.fda.gov.'' August 05. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/centersoffices/officeofmedicalproductsandtobacco/cber/ucm133077.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the complexity, risk of adverse events and allergic reactions associated with biologics, management is very important for the safety of patients.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Committee on Rheumatologic Care, (2015). ''The Complexity of Biologics and their Coverage and Payment.'' American College of Rheumatology&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Management includes areas from patient education and adherence to the delivery of the medication.&amp;nbsp; These medications often require very specific storage conditions and monitoring of temperature, the level of agitation and proper reconstitution of the drug .&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Because of the high risk of error and adverse events, provider management of delivery is required, especially for injection or infusion of some biologic medications. Such biologics are often coded in a way that ties reimbursement to delivery by a provider—either a specialty pharmacist or medical care provider with those skills.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, (2006). ''Concept Series Paper on Specialty Pharmaceuticals.'' Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, 4. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://amcp.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=9305&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp; As more biologics are being designed to be self-administered pharmacists are supporting the management of these drugs.&amp;nbsp; They make calls to remind patients of the need for refills, provide education to patients, monitor patients for adverse events and work with primary care provider offices to monitor the outcomes of the medication.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The high cost of specialty pharmaceuticals is one of their defining characteristics; as such, cost-containment is high on the list of all the players in the arena.&amp;nbsp; For physician-administered biologics, cost-containment is often handled by volume purchasing of biologic drugs for discounted pricing, formularies, step therapy to attempt other treatment before beginning biologics and administrative fees by insurers to keep physicians from artificially inflating requested reimbursement from insurance companies.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Petigara, T., Anderson, G., (2008). ''Strategies to reduce the high cost of biologics.'' Health Policy Monitor. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hpm.org/survey/us/b12/3&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Cost-containment for self-administered biologics tends to occur via requiring authorization to be prescribed those drugs and benefit design, such as coinsurance for cost-sharing.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The 21st Century Cures Act which addressed fast-tracking approval of specialty pharmaceuticals was particularly beneficial for dealing with the development of 2nd run biologics (which might be more easily understood as "generic biologics", though they do not exist).&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;O'Connor, M., (2016). "Real-world results determine value-based price for specialty drugs." ''Managed Healthcare Executive.'' July 01.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Debate around the act raised some important questions about the efficacy of biologics and their continued high costs.&amp;nbsp;Some call for insurers to pay only the cost of production to manufacturers until the benefit of these biologics can be proven long-term, stating that insurers should not bear the full cost of products that may be unreliable or have only limited efficacy.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Achieving this would require conducting studies that assess value, such as comparative effectiveness studies and using those studies to determine pricing. Comparative effectiveness would examine all aspects of the use of biologics, from outcomes such as clinical benefits and potential harms, to efficiency of administration, public health benefits and patient productivity after treatment.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Ollendorf, D.A., Chapman, R., Khan, S., Russo, E.T., Synnott, P.G., Pearson, S.D., Carlson, J.J., Guzauskas, G.F., (2016). ''Treatment Options for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Effectiveness, Value, and Value-Based Price Benchmarks.'' Boston: Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a new direction in managing the high costs of specialty pharmaceuticals and not without challenges.&amp;nbsp; One of the barriers is strict regulation by the Food and Drug Administration of what pharmaceutical manufacturers may communicate to the public, limiting that communication to formulary committees for managed care, for example.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perfetto E.M., Bailey Jr J.E., Gans-Brangs K.R., Romano S.J., Rosenthal N.R., Willke R.J. | year = 2012 | title = Communication about results of comparative effectiveness studies: a pharmaceutical industry view | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 2213–2219 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0745 | pmid = 23048099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp; Additionally, studies tend to be constructed using observational design, instead of as randomized controlled trials, limiting their usefulness for real-world application.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

Difficulties experienced with patient adherence to specialty pharmaceuticals also limit the availability of real-world outcomes data for biologics.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  In 2016, real world data evaluating the efficacy of biologics was only publicly available for multiple myeloma through ICER (where biologics were found to be overpriced for their outcomes)&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; and for hepatitis C treatment (which achieved high cure rates—90%—for patients co-infected with HIV and Hep C) through Curant Health.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; &amp;nbsp; These studies show how useful value-based pricing may become for cost-containment in the field.&amp;nbsp; The good news is that there are effectiveness studies on biologics currently underway aiming to provide more of this data.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

==Regulation==
Biologics or biological products for human use are regulated by the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] (CBER), overseen by the [[Office of Global Regulatory Operations and Policy|Office of Medical Products and Tobacco]], within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration which includes the [[Public Health Service Act]] and the [[Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref name="FDA_CBER"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/default.htm | title=About the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) | publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date=26 March 2015 | access-date=11 October 2015 | location=Silver Spring, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; "CBER protects and advances the public health by ensuring that biological products are safe and effective and available to those who need them. CBER also provides the public with information to promote the safe and appropriate use of biological products."

==Specialty market participants==
There are multiple players in specialty drugs including the employer, the health plan, the [[Pharmacy benefit management|pharmacy benefits manager]] and it is unclear who should be in charge of controlling costs and monitoring care.&lt;ref name="workforce.com" /&gt; Pharmacies generally buy a product from a wholesaler and sell (Buy &amp; Bill) it to the patient and provide basic drug use information and counseling. According to Maria Hardin, vice president of patient services for the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], an alliance of voluntary health and patient advocacy groups working with rare diseases, "As the cost of drugs increases, management of the financial side has gotten more complex... The issues range from Medicare Part D to tiered benefits, prior authorizations, and no benefits. These patients need a pharmacy with the expertise and the clout to go to bat for them. If the patient doesn't get treated, the specialty pharmacy doesn't get paid."&lt;ref name="drugtopics" /&gt;

Alexion Pharmaceuticals was one of the pioneers in the use of a business model of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. "Knowing the value of specialty drugs as well as its own stock is Alexion's business."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Since other big pharmaceutical companies had tended to ignore these markets, Alexion had minimal competition at first. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Alexion Puts Its Soaring Stock Price to Good Use|date=May 6, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/business/dealbook/alexion-puts-its-soaring-stock-price-to-good-use.html|access-date=May 7, 2015|work=The New York Times|author=Robert Cyran}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;  The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition. of May 2015, Alexion is currently seeking approval of its second drug, Strensiq.  It will be used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder. In 2015 Alexion estimated that Synageva, its specialty drug for [[lysosomal acid lipase deficiency]], a fatal genetic disorder, could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=Biotech blastoff: Synageva up 112% on $8B Alexion deal|agency=AP|author=Tom Murphy|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/05/06/alexion-synageva/70909976/|date=May 7, 2015|access-date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies like Magellan RX Management provide a "single source for high-touch patient care management to control side effects, patient support and education to ensure compliance or continued treatment, and specialized handling and distribution of medications directly to the patient or care provider. Specialty medications may be covered under either the medical or pharmacy benefit."&lt;ref name="magellanrx_2015" /&gt;

According to an article published in 2014 in the journal ''Pharmacoeconomics'',&lt;ref name="Pharmacoeconomics_2014" /&gt; "[s]pecialty pharmacies combine medication dispensing with clinical disease management. Their services have been used to improve patient outcomes and contain costs of specialty pharmaceuticals. These may be part of independent pharmacy businesses, retail pharmacy chains, wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, or health insurance companies. Over the last several years, payers have been transitioning to obligate beneficiaries to receive self-administered agents from contracted specialty pharmacies, limiting the choice of acceptable specialty pharmacy providers (SPPs) for patient services."&lt;ref name="Pharmacoeconomics_2014" /&gt;

===Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers===
[[Managed care|Managed care organizations]] contract with Specialty Pharmacy vendors. "Managed care organizations (MCOs) are using varied strategies to manage utilization and costs. For example, 58% of 109 MCOs surveyed implement prior authorizations for MS specialty therapies."&lt;ref name="Pharmacoeconomics_2014"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=PharmacoEconomics |date= 14 August 2014 |volume= 32 |number=11 |pages=1105–1114 |doi=10.1007/s40273-014-0196-0  |title=A Review of Approaches for the Management of Specialty Pharmaceuticals in the United States |author1=Patel, Bijal Nitin |author2=Audet, Patricia R.

===Independent specialty pharmacies===

Tom Westrich, of St. Louis, Missouri-based Centric Health Resources, a specialty pharmacy, described how their specialty drugs treat [[orphan disease|ultra-orphan diseases]] with a total patient population of 20,000 nationwide.&lt;ref name="drugtopics"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drug-topics/news/modernmedicine/modern-medicine-feature-articles/rarest-orphan-drugs-find-specialty-?page=full | title=The rarest of orphan drugs find a specialty-pharmacy distributor | date=1 May 2009 | access-date=24 September 2015 | author=Gebhart, Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail pharmacies===
The top ten specialty pharmacies in 2014 were CVS Specialty parent company [[CVS Health]] with $20.5B in sales, [[Express Scripts]]'s [[Accredo]] at $15B, [[Walgreens Boots Alliance]]'s Walgreens Specialty at $8.5B, [[UnitedHealth Group]]'s [[OptumRx]] at $2.4B, Diplomat Pharmacy at $2.1B,

===Hospitals and physicians===
In 2010 the United States enacted a new health law which had unintended consequences. Because of the 2010 law, drug companies like [[Genentech]] informed children's hospitals that they would no longer get discounts for certain cancer medicines such as the orphan drugs [[Avastin]], [[Herceptin]], [[Rituxan]], [[Tarceva]], or [[Activase]]. This cost hospitals millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="NYT_2010_Dec_8"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/health/policy/08health.html | title=Children's Hospitals Lose Some Drug Discounts | work=New York Times | date=7 December 2010 | access-date=26 October 2015 | author=Pear, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a debate about whether specialty drugs should be managed as a medical benefit or a pharmaceutical benefit. Infused or injected medications are usually covered under the medical benefit and oral medications are covered under the pharmacy benefit. Self-injected medications may be either.&lt;ref name="managedcaremag_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2015/1/should-specialty-drugs-be-shifted-medical-pharmacy-benefit | title=Should Specialty Drugs Be Shifted From Medical to Pharmacy Benefit? | publisher=Managed Care Magazine | date=2015 | access-date=5 October 2015 | author=Wehrwein, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many biologics, such as chemotherapy drugs, are administered in a doctor's office and require extensive monitoring, further driving up costs."&lt;ref name="workforce.com" /&gt; Chemotherapy is usually [[Route of administration|delivered]] [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]], although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g. specialty drugs, [[melphalan]] (trade name Alkeran), [[busulfan]], [[capecitabine]]). [[Delcath Systems, Inc.]] (NASDAQ: DCTH) a specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company manufactures melphalan.&lt;ref name="news-medical.net_2015"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20150720/Melphalan-granted-FDA-Orphan-Drug-Designation-for-treatment-of-cholangiocarcinoma.aspx | title=Melphalan granted FDA Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of cholangiocarcinoma | work=News-Medical.Net | access-date=6 October 2015 | date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011 the oral medications for cancer patients represented approximately 35% of cancer medications. Prior to the increase in cancer oral drugs community cancer centers were used to managing office-administered [[chemotherapy]] treatments. At that time "the majority of community oncology practices were unfamiliar with the process of prescribing and obtaining drugs that are covered under the pharmacy benefit" and "conventional retail pharmacy chains were ill-prepared to stock oral oncology agents, and were not set up to deliver the counseling that often accompanies these medications".&lt;ref name="Hematology_Oncology"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jhoponline.com/innovations-in-oncology-management/part-6/16444-specialty-pharmacy-services-an-overview-for-oncology-practices | title=Specialty Pharmacy Services: An Overview for Oncology Practices | journal=The Journal of Hematology Oncology Pharmacy | date=29 July 2015 | access-date=6 October 2015 | volume=2 | number=2 | issn=2164-1161 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007174643/http://jhoponline.com/innovations-in-oncology-management/part-6/16444-specialty-pharmacy-services-an-overview-for-oncology-practices | archive-date=7 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. national market share ==
According to [[IMS Health]] "Specialty pharmaceutical spending is on the rise and is expected to increase from approximately $55 billion in 2005 to $1.7 trillion in 2030, according to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. That reflects an increase from 24% of total drug spend in 2005 to an estimated 44% of a health plan's total drug expenditure in 2030."&lt;ref name="imshealth"/&gt;

===Mergers and acquisitions among specialty pharmacies===
While CVS, Accredo, and Walgreens led the Specialty Pharmacies (SP) market in revenue in 2014, there are constant changes through mergers and acquisitions in terms of SPs and specialty distributors (SDs).&lt;ref name="healthstrategies_May_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.healthstrategies.com/blog/specialty-pharmacies-and-specialty-distributors-strengths-and-weaknesses | title=Specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors: strengths and weaknesses | work=Health Strategies | date=8 May 2015 | access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SP/SD network faces common strengths such as "in-depth clinical management, coordinated/comprehensive care, and early limited distribution network success" and common weaknesses, "lack of ability to customize services, poor integration experience and outcomes, and strained pharma relations".&lt;ref name="healthstrategies_May_2015" /&gt; [[BioScrip]] was acquired by Walgreens in 2012.&lt;ref name="pjsolomon_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pjsolomon.com/announcements/walgreen-co-to-acquire-bioscrip-s-specialty-pharmacies-and-mail-service-businesses | title=Walgreen Co to acquire BioScrip's Specialty Pharmacies | publisher=Peter J.

===Specialty hubs===
According to Nicolas Basta, by 2013 there was "a spate of new entities" called hub services, "mechanisms by which manufacturers can keep a grip on the marketplace" in specialty pharma. The "biggest and oldest of these organizations" are "offshoots of insurance companies or [Pharmacy benefit managers] PBMs, such as Express Scripts' combination of [[Accredo]] and CuraScript (both specialty pharmacies) and HealthBridge (physician and patient support). UnitedHealth, an insurance company, operates OptumRx, a PBM, which has a specialty unit within it. Cigna has Tel-Drug, a mail-order pharmacy and support system."&lt;ref name="Pharmaceutical_Commerce_2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/special_report?articleid=26972 | title=Finding the 'HUB' in Specialty Pharma Services | work=Pharmaceutical Commerce | date=18 September 2013 | access-date=5 October 2015 | author=Basta, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basta described how Hubs have been around since about 2002 "starting out as "reimbursement hubs"", usually provided as a service by manufacturers to help patients and providers navigate the process of obtaining permission to use, and reimbursement for, expensive specialty therapies". Industry observers look to pioneering efforts by [[Genentech]] and [[Genzyme]] under the tenure of [[Henri Termeer]], "when some of their earliest biotech products entered the marketplace".&lt;ref name="Pharmaceutical_Commerce_2013" /&gt; Specialty hubs provide reimbursement support to physicians and patients as well as patient education including medical hotlines. There is a voluntary program enrollment and registry intake with Patient Assistance Program management.

===Affordability of specialty drugs and patient compliance with care plan===

According to a 2007 study by employees of [[Express Scripts]] or its wholly owned subsidiary [[CuraScript]] on specialty pharmacy costs, if payers manage cost control through copayments with patients, there is an increased risk that patients will forego essential but expensive specialty drugs.&lt;ref name="compliance_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Miller, Steve B.|author2=Tracy A.

===Captive pharmacies===
In 2015 [[Bloomberg News]] used the term 'captive pharmacies' to describe the alleged exclusive agreements such as that between the specialty mail-order pharmacy [[Philidor Rx Services|Philodor]] and [[Valeant]], mail-order pharmacy [[Linden Care]] and [[Horizon Pharma Plc]]. In November 2015 [[Express Scripts]] Holding Co.—the largest U.S. manager of prescription drug benefits—"removed the mail-order pharmacy Linden Care LLC from its network after concluding it dispensed a large portion of its medications from Horizon Pharma Plc and didn't fulfill its contractual agreements". Express Scripts was "evaluating other 'captive pharmacies' that it said are mostly distributing Horizon drugs". In 2015 specialty pharmacies like "Philidor drew attention for the lengths they went to fill prescriptions with brand-name drugs and then secure insurance reimbursement.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_2015_Valeant" /&gt;

According to Pfenex, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, the proposed terms in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement between twelve [[Pacific Rim]] countries, meant that all participating countries had to adopt the United States' lengthy drug patent exclusivity protection period of 12 years for biologics and specialty drugs.&lt;ref name="pfenex"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pfenex.com/how-proposed-tpp-regulations-stand-in-the-way-of-patient-access/ | title=How Proposed TPP Regulations Stand in the Way of Patient Access | publisher=Pfenex | date=23 September 2015 | access-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

In 1981 an episode of the television series ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' starring star, [[Jack Klugman]] as Quincy, entitled "Seldom Silent, Never Heard" brought the plight of children with orphan diseases to public attention. In the episode, Jeffrey, a young boy with [[Tourette syndrome]], died after falling from a building. Dr. Arthur Ciotti ([[Michael Constantine]]), a medical doctor who had been researching Tourette syndrome for years wanted to study Jeffrey's brain to discover the cause and cure for the rare disease. He explained to Quincy that drug companies, like the one where he worked, were not interested in doing the research because so few people were afflicted with them that it was not financially viable.&lt;ref name="tv_com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tv.com/shows/quincy-me/seldom-silent-never-heard-42316/ | title=Seldom Silent, Never Heard | work=TV | date=27 October 1982 | access-date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 another episode "Give Me Your Weak" Klugman as Quincy testified before Congress in an effort to get the Orphan Drug Act passed.

      <text bytes="31806" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Framework for defining species}}
The '''species problem''' is the set of questions that arises when [[biologist]]s attempt to define what a [[species]] is. Such a definition is called a '''species concept'''; there are at least 26 recognized species concepts.&lt;ref name=wilkins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/01/a-list-of-26-species-concepts/ |title=A List of 26 Species Concepts |publisher=Science Blogs |first=John S. |last=Wilkins |date=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A species concept that works well for [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] organisms such as birds may be useless for species that [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]], such as bacteria. The scientific study of the species problem has been called '''microtaxonomy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |author-link=Ernst Mayr |year=1982  |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press  |isbn=9780674364462 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHThtE2R0UQC |chapter=Chapter 6: Microtaxonomy, the science of species}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common, but sometimes difficult, question is how best to decide which species an [[organism]] belongs to, because reproductively isolated groups may not be readily recognizable, and [[Cryptic species complex|cryptic species]] may be present. There is a continuum from ''[[reproductive isolation]]'' with no interbreeding, to ''[[panmixis]]'', unlimited interbreeding. Populations can move forward or backwards along this continuum, at any point meeting the criteria for one or another species concept, and failing others.

Many of the debates on species touch on philosophical issues, such as [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], and on issues of [[language]] and [[cognition]].

The current meaning of the phrase "species problem" is quite different from what [[Charles Darwin]] and others meant by it during the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robson |first=G. C. |year=1928 |title=The Species Problem: an Introduction to the Study of Evolutionary Divergence in Natural Populations |publisher=Oliver and Boyd |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Darwin, the species problem was the question of [[Speciation|how new species arose]]. Darwin was however one of the first people to question how well-defined species are, given that they constantly change.

== History ==
{{main article|Species}}

=== Before Darwin ===
The idea that an organism reproduces by giving birth to a similar organism, or producing seeds that grow to a similar organism, goes back to the earliest days of farming. While people tended to think of this as a relatively stable process, many thought that change was possible. The term ''species'' was just used as a term for a sort or kind of organism, until in 1686 [[John Ray]] introduced the biological concept that species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species.&lt;ref name=SpeciesKindsEvolution&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/26/4/species-kinds-evolution |title=Species, Kinds, and Evolution |author= Wilkins, John S. |year=2006 |publisher=Reports of the [[National Center for Science Education]] |access-date=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/05/the_first_biological_species_c.php |title=The first biological species concept : Evolving Thoughts |author=Wilkins, John S. |date=May 10, 2009 |access-date=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515041359/http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/05/the_first_biological_species_c.php |archive-date=May 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) formalized the [[taxon]]omic rank of species, and devised the two part naming system of [[binomial nomenclature]] that we use today. However, this did not prevent disagreements on the best way to identify species.

The history of definitions of the term ''species''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=N.L. |title=The taxonomic aspect of the species question |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=42 |issue=496 |pages=225–242 |date=April 1908 |doi=10.1086/278927|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431349 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayr1982"/&gt; reveal that the seeds of the modern species debate were alive and growing long before Darwin.

{{Quote|text=The traditional view, which was developed by [[Arthur Cain|Cain]], [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]] and [[David Hull (philosopher)|Hull]] in the mid-twentieth century, claims that until the ‘Origin of species’ by Charles Darwin both philosophy and biology considered species as invariable natural kinds with essential features. This ‘[[essentialism]] story’ was adopted by many authors, but questioned from the beginning by a minority … when [[Aristotle]] and the early naturalists wrote about the essences of species, they meant essential ‘functions’, not essential ‘properties’. Richards pointed out [Richard A. Richards, ''The Species Problem: A Philosophical Analysis'', Cambridge University Press, 2010] that Linnaeus saw species as eternally fixed in his very first publication from 1735, but only a few years later he discovered hybridization as a modus for speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haveman, R. |year=2013 |title=Freakish patterns – species and species concepts in apomicts |journal=Nordic Journal of Botany |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=257–269 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.00158.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== From Darwin to Mayr ===

[[Charles Darwin]]'s famous book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) offered an explanation as to how species [[evolution|evolve]], given enough time. Although Darwin did not provide details on how species can split into two, he viewed [[speciation]] as a [[gradualism|gradual process]]. If Darwin was correct, then, when new ''incipient species'' are forming, there must be a period of time when they are not yet distinct enough to be recognized as species. Darwin's theory suggested that there was often not going to be an objective fact of the matter, on whether there were one or two species.

Darwin's book triggered a crisis of uncertainty for some biologists over the objectivity of species, and some came to wonder whether individual species could be objectively real — i.e. have an existence that is independent of the human observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=D.S. |date=April 1908 |title=Aspects of the Species Question|journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=42 |issue=496 |page=217 |doi=10.1086/278925|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431347|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=L.H. |date=December 1896 |title=The philosophy of species-making |journal=Botanical Gazette |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=454–462 |doi=10.1086/327442|s2cid=84976432 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/222692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] theory of inheritance and Darwin's theory of evolution by [[natural selection]] were joined in what was called the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. This conjunction of theories also had a large impact on how biologists think about species. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Edward Poulton]] anticipated many ideas on species that today are well accepted, and that were later more fully developed by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[Ernst Mayr]], two of the architects of the modern synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mallet |first=James |author-link=James Mallet |date=December 2003 |title=Perspectives Poulton, Wallace and Jordan: how discoveries in Papilio butterflies led to a new species concept 100 years ago |journal=Systematics and Biodiversity |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=441–452 |doi=10.1017/S1477200003001300|s2cid=86041887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobzhansky's 1937 book&lt;ref name="dobzhansky1937"/&gt; articulated the genetic processes that occur when incipient species are beginning to diverge. In particular, Dobzhansky described the critical role, for the formation of new species, of the evolution of [[reproductive isolation]].

=== Mayr's ''Biological Species Concept'' ===

[[Ernst Mayr]]'s 1942 book was a turning point for the species problem.&lt;ref name="mayr1942"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |author-link=Ernst Mayr |year=1942 |title=Systematics and the origin of species from the viewpoint of a zoologist |url=https://archive.org/details/systematicsorigi0000mayr_p8z7 |url-access=registration |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-674-86250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he wrote about how different investigators approach species identification, and he characterized their approaches as species concepts. He argued for what came to be called the ''Biological Species Concept'' (BSC), that a species consists of populations of organisms that can reproduce with one another and that are reproductively isolated from other populations, though he was not the first to define "species" on the basis of reproductive compatibility.&lt;ref name="mayr1982"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=E. |author-link=Ernst Mayr |year=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-36445-5|title-link=The Growth of Biological Thought }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mayr discusses how [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] proposed this kind of definition of "species" in 1753.
[[Dobzhansky|Theodosius Dobzhansky]] was a contemporary of Mayr and the author of a classic book about the evolutionary origins of reproductive barriers between species, published a few years before Mayr's.&lt;ref name="dobzhansky1937"/&gt; Many biologists credit Dobzhansky and Mayr jointly for emphasizing reproductive isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mallet |first=James |author-link=James Mallet |date=November 2001 |title=The speciation revolution |journal=[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=887–888 |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00342.x|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |author-link=Jerry Coyne |year=1994 |title=Ernst Mayr and the origin of species |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=48 |pages=19–30 |doi=10.2307/2409999 |issue=1 |jstor=2409999|pmid=28567778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mayr's book, some two dozen species concepts were introduced. Some, such as the [[Species#Phylogenetic,_cladistic,_or_evolutionary_species|Phylogenetic Species Concept]] (PSC), were designed to be more useful than the BSC for describing species.

== Philosophical aspects ==

=== Realism ===

[[Philosophical realism|Realism]], in the context of the species problem, is the philosophical position that species are real mind-independent entities, [[natural kind]]s. Mayr, a proponent of realism, attempted to demonstrate species exist as natural, extra-mental categories. He showed for example that the New Guinean tribesman classify 136 species of birds, which Western ornithologists came to independently recognize:

{{Quote|I have always thought that there is no more devastating refutation of the nominalistic claims than the above mentioned fact that primitive natives in New Guinea, with a Stone Age culture, recognize as species exactly the same entities of nature as western taxonomists. If species were something purely arbitrary, it would be totally improbable for representatives of two drastically different cultures to arrive at the identical species delimitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Toward a New Philosophy of Biology|page = 317|first = Ernst|last = Mayr|publisher = Harvard University Press |date = 1988|isbn = 9780674896666|title-link = Toward a New Philosophy of Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mayr's argument however has been criticized:

{{Quote|The fact that independently observing humans see much the same species in nature does not show that species are real rather than nominal categories. The most it shows is that all human brains are wired up with a similar perceptual cluster statistic (Ridley, 1993). On this view we [humans] might have been "wired" differently and different species might now be wired differently from us, so that no one wiring can be said to be "true" or "veridical."&lt;ref&gt;Stamos, D. N. (2003). ''The Species Problem''. Lexington Books. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another position of realism is that natural kinds are demarcated by the world itself by having a unique property that is shared by all the members of a species, and none outside the group. In other words, a natural kind possesses an essential or intrinsic feature (“essence”) that is self-individuating and non-arbitrary. This notion has been heavily criticized as [[essentialism|essentialist]], but modern realists have argued that while biological natural kinds have essences, these need not be fixed and are prone to change through [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Okasha, S. 2002. Darwinian metaphysics: Species and the question of essentialism. ''Synthese''. 131: 191–213.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mayr reproductive isolation or interbreeding "supplies an objective yardstick, a completely non-arbitrary criterion” and "describing a presence or absence relationship makes this species concept non-arbitrary".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=Kevin |date=2005-05-03 |title=Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=102 |issue=suppl_1 |pages=6600–6607 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0502030102 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=1131873 |pmid=15851674|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.6600D |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSC defines species as "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From this perspective, each species is based on a property (reproductive isolation) that is shared by all the organisms in the species that objectively distinguishes them.

===Nominalism===

Some philosophical variants of [[nominalism]] propose that species are just names that people have assigned to groups of creatures but where the lines between species get drawn does not reflect any fundamental underlying biological cut-off point. In this view, the kinds of things that people have given names to, do not reflect any underlying reality. It then follows that species do not exist outside the mind, because species are just named abstractions. If species are not real, then it would not be sensible to talk about "the origin of a species" or the "evolution of a species". As recently at least as the 1950s, some authors adopted this view and wrote of species as not being real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregg |first=J.R. |date=November–December 1950 |title=Taxonomy, language and reality |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=84 |issue=819 |pages=419–435 |doi=10.1086/281639|s2cid=84167383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burma |first=B.H. |year=1954 |chapter=Reality, existence, and classification: A discussion of the species problem |pages=193–209 |editor-last=Slobodchikoff |editor-first=C.N. |title=Concepts of species |publisher=Dowden, Hutchinson &amp; Ross |location=Stroudsburg, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A counterpoint to the nominalist views in regard to species, was raised by [[Michael Ghiselin]] who argued that an individual species is not a type, but rather an actual individual, an actual [[wikt:entity|entity]].&lt;ref name="ghiselen1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghiselin |first=M.T. |year=1997 |title=Metaphysics and the origin of species |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, NY |isbn=978-0-7914-3468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea comes from thinking of a species as an evolving dynamic population. If viewed as an entity, a species would exist regardless of whether or not people have observed it and whether or not it has been given a name.

===Pragmatism===

A popular alternative view, [[pragmatism]], espoused by philosophers such as [[Philip Kitcher]] and [[John Dupré]] states while species do not exist in the sense of [[natural kind]]s, they are ''[[concept]]ually'' real and exist for convenience and for practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Dupré, J. (2001). "In defence of classification". ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences''. 32: 203–219.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, regardless of which definition of species one uses, one can still quantitatively compare [[species diversity]] across regions or decades, as long as the definition is held constant within a study. This has practical importance in advancing [[biodiversity]] science and [[environmental science]].

===Language and the role of human investigators===

The nominalist critique of the view that kinds of things exist, raises for consideration the role that humans play in the species problem. For example, Haldane suggested that species are just mental abstractions.&lt;ref name="haldane1956"/&gt;

Several authors have noted the similarity between "species", as a word of ambiguous meaning, and points made by [[Wittgenstein]] on [[family resemblance]] concepts and the indeterminacy of language.&lt;ref name="pigliucci2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hull |first=D.L. |date=September 1978 |title=A matter of individuality |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=335–360 |doi=10.1086/288811 |s2cid=170157356 |url=http://www.phylosophy.org/Hull-Individuality-PoS1978.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jardine |first=N. |date=March 1969 |title=A logical basis for biological classification |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–52 |doi=10.2307/2412409 |jstor=2412409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jody Hey]] described the species problem as a result of two conflicting motivations by biologists:&lt;ref name="heyGCS2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hey2001"/&gt;
# to categorize and identify organisms;
# to understand the evolutionary processes that give rise to species.

Under the first view, species appear to us as typical natural kinds, but when biologists turn to understand species evolutionarily they are revealed as changeable and without sharp boundaries. [[Jody Hey|Hey]] argued that it is unrealistic to expect that one definition of "species" is going to serve the need for categorization and still reflect the changeable realities of evolving species.

=== Pluralism and monism ===

Many approaches to the species problem have attempted to develop one single common conception of what species are and of how they should be identified. It is thought that, if such a [[monism|monistic]] description of species could be developed and agreed upon, then the species problem would be solved. In contrast, authors such as the botanist [[Brent Mishler]] have argued for [[Scientific pluralism|pluralism]], claiming that biologists cannot have just one shared concept of species, and that they should accept multiple, seemingly incompatible ideas about species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dupré |first=J. |year=1999 |chapter=On the impossibility of a monistic account of species |pages=[https://archive.org/details/speciesnewinterd00wils/page/n14 3]–22 |editor-last=Wilson |editor-first=R.A. |title=Species: New Interdisciplinary Essays |url=https://archive.org/details/speciesnewinterd00wils |url-access=limited |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-262-73123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mishler |first1=Brent D. |author1-link=Brent Mishler |last2=Donoghue |first2=M.J. |date=December 1982 |title=Species concepts: A case for pluralism |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=491–503 |doi=10.2307/2413371 |jstor=2413371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=M. |date=December 1992 |title=Eliminative pluralism |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=671–690 |doi=10.1086/289701 |s2cid=224829314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |author1-link=Massimo Pigliucci |title=Wittgenstein Solves (Posthumously) the Species Problem|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/50/Wittgenstein_Solves_Posthumously_the_Species_Problem |publisher=Philosophy Now |access-date=2 December 2016 |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hull (philosopher)|David Hull]] however argued that pluralist proposals were unlikely to actually solve the species problem.&lt;ref name="Hull-Species" /&gt;

A '''species description''' is a formal description of a newly discovered [[species]], usually in the form of a [[scientific paper]].  Its purpose is to give a clear description of a new species of [[organism]] and explain how it differs from species that have been described previously or are related. The species description often contains photographs or other illustrations of the [[type (biology)|type material]] and states in which museums it has been deposited. The publication in which the species is described gives the new species a formal [[scientific name]]. Some 1.9&amp;nbsp;million species have been identified and described, out of some 8.7&amp;nbsp;million that may actually exist.&lt;ref name=plos&gt;{{cite journal | author= Mora, C.| title=How Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?|journal=[[PLOS Biology]]|date=23 August 2011|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127 |pmid=21886479 |pmc=3160336 |volume=9 | issue=8|pages=e1001127|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions more have become [[extinction|extinct]] throughout the existence of life on Earth.

== Naming process ==
{{see also|Scientific nomenclature}}

A name of a new species becomes [[Validly published name|valid]] ([[Available name|available]] in zoological terminology) with the date of publication of its formal scientific description. Once the scientist has performed the necessary research to determine that the discovered organism represents a new species, the scientific results are summarized in a scientific manuscript, either as part of a book or as a paper to be submitted to a [[scientific journal]].

A scientific species description must fulfill several formal criteria specified by the [[nomenclature codes]], e.g. selection of at least one [[Type (biology)|type specimen]]. These criteria are intended to ensure that the species name is clear and unambiguous, for example, the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] states that "Authors should exercise reasonable care and consideration in forming new names to ensure that they are chosen with their subsequent users in mind and that, as far as possible, they are appropriate, compact, [[euphonious]], memorable, and do not cause offence."&lt;ref name="ICZNRec25C"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=18 June 2011|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Recommendation 25C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species names are written in the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, but many species names are based on words from other languages, and are Latinized.

Once the manuscript has been accepted for publication,&lt;ref name="ICZNexampleabstract"&gt;One example of an abstract of an article naming a new species can be found at {{cite journal|last1=Wellner|first1=S.|last2=Lodders|first2=N.|last3=Kampfer|first3=P.|title=Methylobacterium cerastii sp. nov., isolated from the leaf surface of Cerastium holosteoides|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|date=13 June 2011|volume=62|issue=Pt 4|pages=917–924|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.030767-0|pmid=21669927|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new species name is officially created.

Once a species name has been assigned and approved, it can generally not be changed except in the case of error.  For example, a species of beetle (''[[Anophthalmus hitleri]]'') was named by a German collector after [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933 when he had recently become chancellor of Germany.&lt;ref name="hitler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosegeorge.com/site/a-beetle-called-hitler|title=A beetle called Hitler|date=13 April 2002|work=Rose George}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear whether such a dedication would be considered acceptable or appropriate today, but the name remains in use.&lt;ref name="hitler" /&gt;

Species names have been chosen on many different bases. The most common is a naming for the species' external appearance, its origin, or the species name is a dedication to a certain person.  Examples would include a bat species named for the two stripes on its back (''[[Saccopteryx bilineata]]''), a frog named for its Bolivian origin (''[[Phyllomedusa boliviana]]''), and an ant species dedicated to the actor [[Harrison Ford]] (''[[Pheidole harrisonfordi]]''). A scientific name in honor of a person or persons is known as a taxonomic '''eponym''' or eponymic; '''patronym''' and '''matronym''' are the gendered terms for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Capinera|editor1-first=John L.|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1402062421|page=2765|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;q=patronym&amp;pg=PA2765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Strahan|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Conder|editor2-first=Pamela|title=Dictionary of Australian and New Guinean Mammals|date=2007|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria|page=15|isbn=9780643100060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmJsAzEXRyEC&amp;pg=PT15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of humorous species names also exist.  Literary examples include the genus name ''[[Borogovia]]'' (an extinct dinosaur), which is named after the borogove, a mythical character from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem "[[Jabberwocky]]".  A second example, ''[[Macrocarpaea apparata]]'' (a tall plant) was named after the magical spell "to apparate" from the [[Harry Potter|''Harry Potter'' novels]] by [[J. K. Rowling]], as it seemed to appear out of nowhere.&lt;ref name="funnyspeciesnames"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=18 June 2011|url=http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/index.html|title=Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the British naturalist [[Peter Scott]] proposed the binomial name ''[[Nessiteras rhombopteryx]]'' ("Ness monster with diamond-shaped fin") for the Loch Ness Monster; it was soon spotted that it was an anagram of "Monster hoax by Sir Peter S".

=== Species names recognizing benefactors ===
{{See also|List of organisms named after famous people}}
Species have frequently been named by scientists in recognition of supporters and benefactors.  For example, the genus ''[[Victoria (plant)|Victoria]]'' (a flowering waterplant) was named in honour of [[Queen Victoria]] of Great Britain.  More recently, a species of lemur (''[[Avahi cleesei]]'') was named after the actor [[John Cleese]] in recognition of his work to publicize the plight of lemurs in Madagascar.

Non-profit ecological organizations may also allow benefactors to name new species in exchange for financial support for taxonomic research and nature conservation. A German non-profit organisation, [[BIOPAT – Patrons for Biodiversity]], has raised more than $450,000 for research and conservation through sponsorship of over 100 species using this model.&lt;ref name="fundingecologicalresearch"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=18 June 2011|url=http://www.unep.org/dec/onlinemanual/Enforcement/InstitutionalFrameworks/EconomicInstruments/Resource/tabid/1014/Default.aspx|title=Financing conservation efforts by selling naming rights of new species}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual example of this system is the ''[[Callicebus aureipalatii]]'' (or "monkey of the Golden Palace"), which was named after the [[GoldenPalace.com|Golden Palace casino]] in recognition of a $650,000 contribution to the [[Madidi National Park]] in Bolivia in 2005.&lt;ref name=msnbc2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet casino buys monkey naming rights |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7493711/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/internet-casino-buys-monkey-naming-rights/#.XJkj1yL7S |newspaper=[[MSNBC]] |access-date=25 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] discourages this practice somewhat: "Recommendation 20A. Authors forming generic names should comply with the following ... (h) Not dedicate genera to persons quite unconcerned with botany, mycology, phycology, or natural science in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|ref=ICN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of species descriptions ==
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|right|Original title page of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', published in 1735.]]
Early biologists often published entire volumes or multiple-volume works of descriptions in an attempt to catalog all known species. These catalogs typically featured extensive descriptions of each species and were often illustrated upon reprinting.

The first of these large catalogs was [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals]]'', published around 343 BC. Aristotle included descriptions of creatures, mostly fish and invertebrates, in his homeland, and several [[mythological creature]]s rumored to live in far-away lands, such as the [[manticore]].

In 77 AD [[Pliny the Elder]] dedicated several volumes of his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' to the description of all life forms he knew to exist.  He appears to have read Aristotle's work since he writes about many of the same far-away mythological creatures.

Toward the end of the 12th century, ''[[Konungs skuggsjá]]'', an [[Old Norse]] [[philosophical]] [[didactic]] work, featured several descriptions of the whales, seals, and monsters of the Icelandic seas. These descriptions were brief and often erroneous, and they included a description of the [[mermaid]] and a rare island-like sea monster called [[Hafgufa|''hafgufu'']]. The author was hesitant to mention the beast (known today to be fictitious) for fear of its size, but felt it was important enough to be included in his descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Konungs skuggsjá|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgtIfLwQgX4C&amp;q=hafgfua&amp;pg=PP7|language=no|last1 = Keyser|first1 = Rudolph|last2 = Munch|first2 = Peter Andreas|last3 = Unger|first3 = Carl Rikard|year = 1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the earliest recognized species authority is [[Carl Linnaeus]], who standardized the modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] system beginning with his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1735.&lt;ref name = "linnaeus"&gt;{{cite book|author = Linnaeus, C.|author-link = Carl Linnaeus|title = [[Systema Naturae]]|year = 1735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the catalog of known species was increasing rapidly, it became impractical to maintain a single work documenting every species.  Publishing a paper documenting a single species was much faster and could be done by scientists with less broadened scopes of study.  For example, a scientist who discovered a new species of insect would not need to understand plants, or frogs, or even insects which did not resemble the species, but would only need to understand closely related insects.

== Modern species descriptions ==
Formal species descriptions today follow strict guidelines set forth by the [[codes of nomenclature]]. Very detailed formal descriptions are made by scientists, who usually study the organism closely for a considerable time. A '''diagnosis''' may be used instead of,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|loc=Article 38|ref=ICN}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as well as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |date=1999 |title= International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Fourth Edition, adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences  |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=13&amp;nfv=true}} article 13&lt;/ref&gt; the description. A diagnosis specifies the distinction between the new species and other species, and it does not necessarily have to be based on morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lawley |first=Jonathan W. |last2=Gamero-Mora |first2=Edgar |last3=Maronna |first3=Maximiliano M. |last4=Chiaverano |first4=Luciano M. |last5=Stampar |first5=Sérgio N. |last6=Hopcroft |first6=Russell R. |last7=Collins |first7=Allen G. |last8=Morandini |first8=André C. |date=2022-09-29 |title=Morphology is not always useful for diagnosis, and that’s ok: Species hypotheses should not be bound to a class of data.

In recent times, new species descriptions have been made without voucher specimens, and this has been controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Kannan, Ragupathy (2007).

Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 104: 12–18. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/154730#/summary&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], a '''''species inquirenda''''' is a [[species]] of doubtful identity requiring further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Glossary|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|year=1999|edition=4th|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary&amp;nfv=&amp;mF=true|access-date=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term in English-language biological literature dates back to at least the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Botanical Register|first=Sydenham Teast|volume=5|last=Edwards|author-link=Sydenham Edwards|location=London|year=1819|quote=[[Iris lacustris|lacustris]].

The term '''taxon inquirendum''' is broader in meaning and refers to an incompletely defined [[taxon]] of which the taxonomic validity is uncertain or disputed by different experts or is impossible to identify the taxon. Further characterization is required.

{{biological classification|description=The hierarchy of biological classification's eight major taxonomic ranks. A genus contains one or more species. Intermediate minor rankings are not shown.}}
{{use British English|date=March 2021}}
In [[biology]], a '''species''' is the basic unit of [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification]] and a [[taxonomic rank]] of an [[organism]], as well as a unit of [[biodiversity]]. A species is often defined as the largest group of [[organism]]s in which any two individuals of the appropriate [[sex]]es or mating types can [[reproduction|produce]] [[Fertility|fertile]] [[offspring]], typically by [[sexual reproduction]]. Other ways of defining species include their [[karyotype]], [[DNA]] sequence, [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], behaviour or [[ecological niche]]. In addition, [[paleontologist]]s use the concept of the [[chronospecies]] since [[fossil]] reproduction cannot be examined.

The most recent rigorous estimate for the total number of species of [[eukaryote]]s is between 8 and 8.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |author-link=E. O. Wilson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/opinion/sunday/species-conservation-extinction.html |title=Opinion: The 8 Million Species We Don't Know |date=2018-03-03 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2020-01-25 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Borenstein |first=S. |url=https://apnews.com/aaf1091c5aae40b0a110daaf04950672/ |title=UN report: Humans accelerating extinction of other species |work=Associated Press |date=2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLOS_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mora |first1=Camilo |last2=Tittensor |first2=Derek P. |last3=Adl |first3=Sina |last4=Simpson |first4=Alastair G.

All species (except [[virus]]es) are given a [[binomial nomenclature|two-part name]], a "binomial". The first part of a binomial is the [[genus]] to which the species belongs. The second part is called the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] or the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] (in [[botanical nomenclature]], also sometimes in [[zoological nomenclature]]). For example, ''[[Boa constrictor]]'' is one of the species of the genus ''[[Boa (genus)|Boa]]'', with ''constrictor'' being the species' epithet.

While the definitions given above may seem adequate at first glance, when looked at more closely they represent problematic [[species concept]]s. For example, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear with [[hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]], in a [[species complex]] of hundreds of similar [[microspecies]], and in a [[ring species]]. Also, among organisms that reproduce only [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]], the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a [[microspecies]]. Although none of these are entirely satisfactory definitions, and while the concept of species may not be a perfect model of life, it is still an incredibly useful tool to scientists and [[conservation biology|conservationists]] for studying life on Earth, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If species were fixed and clearly distinct from one another, there would be no problem, but [[evolution]]ary processes cause species to change. This obliges [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] to decide, for example, when enough change has occurred to declare that a lineage should be divided into multiple [[chronospecies]], or when populations have diverged to have enough distinct character states to be described as [[Cladistics|cladistic]] species.

Species were seen from the time of [[Aristotle]] until the 18th century as fixed categories that could be arranged in a hierarchy, the [[great chain of being]]. In the 19th century, biologists grasped that species could evolve given sufficient time. [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' explained how [[speciation|species could arise]] by [[natural selection]]. That understanding was [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|greatly extended in the 20th century]] through [[genetics]] and population [[ecology]]. Genetic variability arises from [[mutation]]s and [[recombination (biology)|recombination]], while organisms themselves are mobile, leading to [[Allopatric speciation|geographical isolation]] and [[genetic drift]] with varying [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]]. Genes can sometimes be exchanged between species by [[horizontal gene transfer]]; new species can arise rapidly through hybridisation and [[polyploid]]y; and species may [[extinction|become extinct]] for a variety of reasons. [[Viruses]] are a special case, driven by a [[mutation–selection balance|balance of mutation and selection]], and can be treated as [[Viral quasispecies|quasispecies]].

==Definition==

Biologists and taxonomists have made many attempts to define species, beginning from [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and moving towards [[genetics]]. Early taxonomists such as Linnaeus had no option but to describe what they saw: this was later formalised as the typological or morphological species concept. [[Ernst Mayr]] emphasised reproductive isolation, but this, like other species concepts, is hard or even impossible to test.&lt;ref name="Zelnio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallet |first1=James |title=A species definition for the modern synthesis |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=1995 |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=294–299 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(95)90031-4 |pmid=21237047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biologists have tried to refine Mayr's definition with the recognition and cohesion concepts, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Masters |first1=J. C. |last2=Spencer |first2=H. G. |title=Why We Need a New Genetic Species Concept |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1989 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=270–279 |doi=10.2307/2992287 |jstor=2992287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the concepts are quite similar or overlap, so they are not easy to count: the biologist R. L. Mayden recorded about 24 concepts,&lt;ref name=Claridge1997&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayden |first1=R. L. |editor1-last=Claridge |editor1-first=M. F. |editor2-first=H.

===Typological or morphological species===

[[File:Eurasian_blue_tit_Lancashire.jpg|thumb|All adult [[Eurasian blue tit]]s share the same coloration, unmistakably identifying the ''morphospecies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gooders |first1=John |title= Kingfisher Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Ireland|page=246 |publisher=Kingfisher Books |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-86272-139-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A typological species is a group of organisms in which individuals conform to certain fixed properties (a type), so that even pre-literate people often recognise the same taxon as do modern taxonomists.&lt;ref name="Gould 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |chapter=A Quahog is a Quahog |title=In: The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

This method was used as a "classical" method of determining species, such as with Linnaeus, early in evolutionary theory. However, different phenotypes are not necessarily different species (e.g. a four-winged ''[[Drosophila]]'' born to a two-winged mother is not a different species). Species named in this manner are called ''morphospecies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruse |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Ruse |title=Definitions of Species in Biology |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=97–119 |year=1969 |jstor=686173 |doi=10.1093/bjps/20.2.97|s2cid=121580839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewin |first=Ralph A. |author-link=Ralph A.

Crovello and [[Peter Sneath]] proposed a variation on the morphological species concept, a [[phenetics|phenetic]] species, defined as a set of organisms with a similar [[phenotype]] to each other, but a different phenotype from other sets of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Claridge|Dawah|Wilson|1997|p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the morphological species concept in including a numerical measure of distance or similarity to cluster entities based on multivariate comparisons of a reasonably large number of phenotypic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |author-link=Michael Ghiselin |title=A Radical Solution to the Species Problem |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=536–544 |year=1974 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/23.4.536|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/GHIARS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the biological species concept, a cladistic species does not rely on reproductive isolation – its criteria are independent of processes that are integral in other concepts.&lt;ref name="Nixon1990"/&gt; Therefore, it applies to asexual lineages.&lt;ref name="Giraud2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor2000"/&gt; However, it does not always provide clear cut and intuitively satisfying boundaries between taxa, and may require multiple sources of evidence, such as more than one polymorphic locus, to give plausible results.&lt;ref name="Taylor2000"/&gt;

===Evolutionary species===

An evolutionary species, suggested by [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1951, is "an entity composed of organisms which maintains its identity from other such entities through time and over space, and which has its own independent evolutionary fate and historical tendencies".&lt;ref name=Claridge1997/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laporte |first1=L.

Wiley and Mayden stated that they see the evolutionary species concept as "identical" to [[Willi Hennig]]'s species-as-lineages concept, and asserted that the biological species concept, "the several versions" of the phylogenetic species concept, and the idea that species are of the same kind as higher taxa are not suitable for biodiversity studies (with the intention of estimating the number of species accurately). They further suggested that the concept works for both asexual and sexually-reproducing species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|Meier|2000|pp=70–92&lt;!--The ESC--&gt;, 146–160&lt;!--A critique from the ESC perspective--&gt;, 198–208&lt;!--A defense of the ESC--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the concept is [[Kevin de Queiroz]]'s "General Lineage Concept of Species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Queiroz |first=Kevin |year=1998 |chapter=The general lineage concept of species, species criteria, and the process of speciation |pages=57–75 |editor1=D. J. Howard |editor2=S. H. Berlocher |title=Endless forms: species and speciation |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological species===

An ecological species is a set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources, called a niche, in the environment. According to this concept, populations form the discrete phenetic clusters that we recognise as species because the ecological and evolutionary processes controlling how resources are divided up tend to produce those clusters.&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ridley |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Ridley (zoologist) |title=Evolution  |publisher=Blackwell Science |chapter=The Idea of Species |edition=2nd |page=719 |isbn=978-0-86542-495-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic species===

A genetic species as defined by Robert Baker and Robert Bradley is a set of genetically isolated interbreeding populations. This is similar to Mayr's Biological Species Concept, but stresses genetic rather than reproductive isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Robert J. |last2=Bradley |first2=Robert D. |title=Speciation in Mammals and the Genetic Species Concept |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |date=2006 |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=643–662 |doi=10.1644/06-MAMM-F-038R2.1 |pmid=19890476 |pmc=2771874}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, a genetic species can be established by comparing DNA sequences, but other methods were available earlier, such as comparing [[karyotype]]s (sets of [[chromosome]]s) and [[allozyme]]s ([[enzyme]] variants).&lt;ref name="BakerBradley2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Robert J. |last2=Bradley |first2=Robert D. |title=Speciation in Mammals and the Genetic Species Concept |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=87 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=643–662 |doi=10.1644/06-MAMM-F-038R2.1|pmid=19890476 |pmc=2771874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[palaeontology]], with only [[comparative anatomy]] (morphology) from [[fossil]]s as evidence, the concept of a [[chronospecies]] can be applied. During [[anagenesis]] (evolution, not necessarily involving branching), palaeontologists seek to identify a sequence of species, each one derived from the [[pseudoextinction|phyletically extinct]] one before through continuous, slow and more or less uniform change. In such a time sequence, palaeontologists assess how much change is required for a morphologically distinct form to be considered a different species from its ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronospecies |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095611471 |publisher=Oxford Reference |access-date=12 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001151656/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095611471 |archive-date=1 October 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carr |first1=Steven M. |title=Evolutionary species and chronospecies |url=https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Evolutionary_vs_Chronospecies.html |publisher=Memorial University Newfoundland and Labrador |access-date=12 January 2018 |date=2005 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310075417/http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Evolutionary_vs_Chronospecies.html |archive-date=10 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dzik |first=J. |year=1985 |title=Typologic versus population concepts of chronospecies: implications for ammonite biostratigraphy |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |pages=71–92 |url=https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app30/app30-071.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313080626/http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app30/app30-071.pdf |archive-date=13 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=Michael J. |last2=Lyman|first2=R.

===Viral quasispecies===
{{main|Viral quasispecies}}

Viruses have enormous populations, are doubtfully living since they consist of little more than a string of DNA or RNA in a protein coat, and mutate rapidly.

Species identification is made difficult by discordance between molecular and morphological investigations; these can be categorised as two types: (i) one morphology, multiple lineages (e.g. [[convergent evolution|morphological convergence]], [[cryptic species]]) and (ii) one lineage, multiple morphologies (e.g. [[phenotypic plasticity]], multiple [[biological life cycle|life-cycle]] stages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014 |title=How discordant morphological and molecular evolution among microorganisms can revise our notions of biodiversity on Earth |journal=BioEssays |volume=36 |issue=10 |pages=950–959 |doi=10.1002/bies.201400056 |last1=Lahr |first1=D.

{{quote|there is no easy way to tell whether related geographic or temporal forms belong to the same or different species. Species gaps can be verified only locally and at a point of time.

===Hybridisation===
{{main|Hybrid (biology)}}

Natural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] presents a challenge to the concept of a reproductively isolated species, as fertile hybrids permit gene flow between two populations. For example, the [[carrion crow]] ''Corvus corone'' and the [[hooded crow]] ''Corvus cornix'' appear and are classified as separate species, yet they hybridise freely where their geographical ranges overlap.&lt;ref name="BerkeleyDefHybrid"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defining a species |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_41 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |access-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313042614/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_41 |archive-date=13 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ring species ===
{{main|Ring species}}

A [[ring species]] is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which can sexually interbreed with adjacent related populations, but for which there exist at least two "end" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential [[gene flow]] between each "linked" population.{{sfn|Zachos|2016|p=188}} Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, "end" populations may [[Sympatric|co-exist in the same region]] thus closing the ring. Ring species thus present a difficulty for any species concept that relies on reproductive isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stamos |first=David N. |title=The Species Problem: Biological Species, Ontology, and the Metaphysics of Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KT02AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330 |date=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-0-7391-6118-0 |page=330 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312134720/https://books.google.com/books?id=KT02AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330 |archive-date=12 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ring species are at best rare.

==Taxonomy and naming==
[[File:Mountain-lion-01623.jpg|thumb|A cougar, mountain lion, panther, or puma, among other common names: its scientific name is ''[[Puma concolor]]''.]]

===Common and scientific names===
The commonly used names for kinds of organisms are often ambiguous: "cat" could mean the domestic cat, ''[[Felis catus]]'', or the cat family, [[Felidae]]. Another problem with common names is that they often vary from place to place, so that puma, cougar, catamount, panther, painter and mountain lion all mean ''[[Puma concolor]]'' in various parts of America, while "panther" may also mean the [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca'') of Latin America or the [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus'') of Africa and Asia. In contrast, the scientific names of species are chosen to be unique and universal; they are [[Binomial nomenclature|in two parts used together]]: the [[genus]] as in ''Puma'', and the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] as in ''concolor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word About Species Names&amp;nbsp;... |url=http://www.sms.si.edu/irlspec/NamSpecies.htm |publisher=Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce |access-date=11 March 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324161039/http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/NamSpecies.htm |archive-date=24 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hone |first1=Dave |title=What's in a name?

{{main|Species description}}

A species is given a [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] name when a [[type (biology)|type specimen]] is described formally, in a publication that assigns it a unique scientific name. The description typically provides means for identifying the new species, which may not be based solely on morphology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lawley |first1=Jonathan W. |last2=Gamero-Mora |first2=Edgar |last3=Maronna |first3=Maximiliano M. |last4=Chiaverano |first4=Luciano M. |last5=Stampar |first5=Sérgio N. |last6=Hopcroft |first6=Russell R. |last7=Collins |first7=Allen G. |last8=Morandini |first8=André C. |date=2022-09-29 |title=Morphology is not always useful for diagnosis, and that's ok: Species hypotheses should not be bound to a class of data.

===Abbreviations===

Books and articles sometimes intentionally do not identify species fully, using the abbreviation "sp." in the singular or "spp." (standing for ''species pluralis'', Latin for "multiple species") in the plural in place of the specific name or epithet (e.g. ''Canis'' sp.). This commonly occurs when authors are confident that some individuals belong to a particular genus but are not sure to which exact species they belong, as is common in [[paleontology]].&lt;ref name=winston /&gt;

Authors may also use "spp." as a short way of saying that something applies to many species within a genus, but not to all. If scientists mean that something applies to all species within a genus, they use the genus name without the specific name or epithet. The names of [[genera]] and species are usually printed in [[italics]]. However, abbreviations such as "sp." should not be italicised.&lt;ref name=winston /&gt;

When a species's identity is not clear, a specialist may use "cf." before the epithet to indicate that confirmation is required. The abbreviations "nr." (near) or "aff." (affine) may be used when the identity is unclear but when the species appears to be similar to the species mentioned after.&lt;ref name="winston"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winston |first=Judith E. |title=Describing species. Practical taxonomic procedure for biologists |publisher=Columbia University Press |place=New York|year=1999 |pages=141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification codes===

With the rise of online databases, codes have been devised to provide identifiers for species that are already defined, including:
* [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI) employs a numeric 'taxid' or ''Taxonomy identifier'', a "stable unique identifier", e.g., the taxid of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is 9606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&amp;id=9606&amp;lvl=3&amp;lin=f&amp;keep=1&amp;srchmode=1&amp;unlock |title=Home – Taxonomy – NCBI |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=19 October 2012 |access-date=25 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207144820/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&amp;id=9606&amp;lvl=3&amp;lin=f&amp;keep=1&amp;srchmode=1&amp;unlock |archive-date=7 February 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes]] (KEGG) employs a three- or four-letter code for a limited number of organisms; in this code, for example, ''H. sapiens'' is simply ''hsa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html |title=KEGG Organisms: Complete Genomes |publisher=Genome.jp |access-date=25 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014160440/http://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html |archive-date=14 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[UniProt]] employs an "organism mnemonic" of not more than five alphanumeric characters, e.g., ''HUMAN'' for ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomy |title=Taxonomy |website=Uniprot.org |access-date=25 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127091404/http://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomy |archive-date=27 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]] (ITIS) provides a unique number for each species. The LSID for ''Homo sapiens'' is urn:lsid:catalogueoflife.org:taxon:4da6736d-d35f-11e6-9d3f-bc764e092680:col20170225.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ITIS: Homo sapiens |url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/e3b90576561f93a8ac8b59e185b01511/synonym/ee0f23e7dd7ddbf69de58c0abba12e5b |publisher=Catalogue of Life |access-date=11 March 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312194754/http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/e3b90576561f93a8ac8b59e185b01511/synonym/ee0f23e7dd7ddbf69de58c0abba12e5b |archive-date=12 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lumping and splitting===
{{main|Lumpers and splitters}}

The naming of a particular species, including which genus (and higher taxa) it is placed in, is a ''hypothesis'' about the evolutionary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be corroborated or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. When two species names are discovered to apply to the same species, the older species name is given [[Principle of Priority|priority]] and usually retained, and the newer name considered as a junior synonym, a process called ''[[synonymy (taxonomy)|synonymy]]''. Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxa is called ''splitting''. Taxonomists are often referred to as "lumpers" or "splitters" by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognising differences or commonalities between organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=George Gaylord |author-link=George Gaylord Simpson |title=The Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=85 |page=23 |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Bob |title=Upstart Antichrist |journal=History Workshop Journal |volume=60 |issue=1 |date=2005 |pages=202–206|doi=10.1093/hwj/dbi042|s2cid=201790420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=winston/&gt; The circumscription of taxa, considered a taxonomic decision at the discretion of cognizant specialists, is not governed by the Codes of Zoological or Botanical Nomenclature.

===Broad and narrow senses===
{{main|Sensu}}

The [[Nomenclature codes|nomenclatural codes]] that guide the naming of species, including the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] for animals and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]] for plants, do not make rules for defining the boundaries of the species. Research can change the boundaries, also known as circumscription, based on new evidence. Species may then need to be distinguished by the boundary definitions used, and in such cases the names may be qualified with ''[[sensu stricto]]'' ("in the narrow sense") to denote usage in the exact meaning given by an author such as the person who named the species, while the [[antonym]] ''sensu lato'' ("in the broad sense") denotes a wider usage, for instance including other subspecies. Other abbreviations such as "auct." ("author"), and qualifiers such as "non" ("not") may be used to further clarify the sense in which the specified authors delineated or described the species.&lt;ref name=winston/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Philip |title=sensu stricto, sensu lato |url=http://www.treeterms.co.uk/definitions/sensu-stricto-sensu-lato |website=AZ of tree terms |date=2016 |access-date=9 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110054734/http://www.treeterms.co.uk/definitions/sensu-stricto-sensu-lato |archive-date=10 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary: sensu |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary&amp;nfv=true |publisher=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |access-date=9 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802164704/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary&amp;nfv=true |archive-date=2 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exchange of genes between species ===
[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|[[Horizontal gene transfer]]s between widely separated species complicate the phylogeny of [[bacteria]].]]
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}

Horizontal gene transfer between organisms of different species, either through [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]], [[antigenic shift]], or [[reassortment]], is sometimes an important source of genetic variation. Viruses can transfer genes between species. Bacteria can exchange plasmids with bacteria of other species, including some apparently distantly related ones in different phylogenetic [[Three-domain system|domains]], making analysis of their relationships difficult, and weakening the concept of a bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pennisi |first=Elizabeth |author-link=Elizabeth Pennisi |page=335 |volume=334–335 |journal=Science |year=2004 |title=Researchers Trade Insights about Gene Swapping |url=http://www2.nau.edu/~bah/BIO471/Reader/Pennisi_2003.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218071130/http://www2.nau.edu/~bah/BIO471/Reader/Pennisi_2003.pdf |archive-date=18 February 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melcher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.02.004 |pmid=15041172 |url=http://web.uconn.edu/gogarten/articles/TIG2004_cladogenesis_paper.pdf |title=Cladogenesis, coalescence and the evolution of the three domains of life |journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=182–187 |year=2004 |last1=Zhaxybayeva |first1=Olga |last2=Peter Gogarten |first2=J. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326181517/http://web.uconn.edu/gogarten/articles/TIG2004_cladogenesis_paper.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vaux&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bij.12872 |title=Speciation through the looking-glass |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=480–488 |year=2017 |last1=Vaux |first1=Felix |last2=Trewick |first2=Steven A. |last3=Morgan-Richards |first3=Mary |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis-Marie Bobay and Howard Ochman suggest, based on analysis of the genomes of many types of bacteria, that they can often be grouped "into communities that regularly swap genes", in much the same way that plants and animals can be grouped into reproductively isolated breeding populations. Bacteria may thus form species, analogous to Mayr's biological species concept, consisting of asexually reproducing populations that exchange genes by homologous recombination.&lt;ref name="Venton2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venton |first=Danielle |title=Highlight: Applying the Biological Species Concept across All of Life |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=3 |year=2017 |pages=502–503 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evx045|pmid=28391326 |pmc=5381533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BobayOchman2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bobay |first1=Louis-Marie |last2=Ochman |first2=Howard |title=Biological Species Are Universal across Life's Domains |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=3 |year=2017 |pages=491–501 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evx026|pmid=28186559 |pmc=5381558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
{{further|Extinction|Extinction event}}

A species is extinct when the [[endling|last individual]] of that species dies, but it may be [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] well before that moment. It is estimated that over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, some five billion species, are now extinct. Some of these were in [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]] such as those at the ends of the [[Ordovician]], [[Devonian]], [[Permian]], [[Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. Mass extinctions had a variety of causes including [[volcano|volcanic activity]], [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]], and changes in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry, and they in turn had major effects on Earth's ecology, atmosphere, land surface and waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kunin |editor1-first=W.

The resulting single species has been termed as a "[[compilospecies]]".{{sfn|Zachos|2016|p=82}}

==Practical implications==
Biologists and [[conservation biology|conservationists]] need to categorise and identify organisms in the course of their work. Difficulty assigning organisms reliably to a species constitutes a threat to the [[external validity|validity]] of research results, for example making measurements of how abundant a species is in an [[ecosystem]] moot. Surveys using a phylogenetic species concept reported 48% more species and accordingly smaller populations and ranges than those using nonphylogenetic concepts; this was termed "taxonomic inflation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/jzs.12088 |title=Taxonomic inflation, the Phylogenetic Species Concept and lineages in the Tree of Life – a cautionary comment on species splitting |journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=180–184 |year=2015 |last1=Zachos |first1=Frank E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could cause a false appearance of change to the number of endangered species and consequent political and practical difficulties.&lt;ref name="Agapow2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul‐Michael |last1=Agapow |first2=Olaf R.

Conservation laws in many countries make special provisions to prevent species from going extinct. Hybridization zones between two species, one that is protected and one that is not, have sometimes led to conflicts between lawmakers, land owners and conservationists. One of the classic cases in North America is that of the protected [[northern spotted owl]] which hybridises with the unprotected [[California spotted owl]] and the [[barred owl]]; this has led to legal debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usgsstaffpub/708 |title=The Endangered Species Act at Thirty, Volume 2: Conserving Biodiversity in Human-Dominated Landscapes |last1=Haig |first1=Susan M. |last2=Allendorf |first2=F.W. |publisher=Island Press |year=2006 |editor1-last=Scott |editor1-first=J.

It has been argued, too, that since species are not comparable, counting them is not a valid measure of [[biodiversity]]; alternative measures of phylogenetic biodiversity have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mishler |first=Brent D. |editor1-last=Wilson |editor1-first=R. |title=Getting Rid of Species? |work=Species: New Interdisciplinary Essays |date=1999 |publisher=MIT Press |pages=307–315 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/672e/7dbe0b756ec853fdb0a3580aca4dffb6f64b.pdf |isbn=978-0262731232 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110174246/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/672e/7dbe0b756ec853fdb0a3580aca4dffb6f64b.pdf |archive-date=10 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vane-Wright |first1=R.

==History==
===Classical forms===
{{main|Aristotle's biology}}

In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] used the term γένος (génos) to mean a kind, such as a [[bird]] or [[fish]], and εἶδος (eidos) to mean a specific [[Hylomorphism|form]] within a kind, such as (within the birds) the [[crane (bird)|crane]], [[eagle]], [[crow]], or [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]. These terms were translated into Latin as "genus" and "species", though they do not correspond to the [[Linnean taxonomy|Linnean terms]] thus named; today the birds are a [[class (taxonomy)|class]], the cranes are a [[family (taxonomy)|family]], and the crows a [[genus]]. A kind was distinguished by its [[Property (philosophy)|attributes]]; for instance, a bird has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood.  A form was distinguished by being shared by all its members, the young inheriting any variations they might have from their parents. Aristotle believed all kinds and forms to be distinct and unchanging. His approach remained influential until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=Leroi88&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |author-link=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |title-link=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed species===
[[File:John Ray from NPG.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[John Ray]] believed that species breed true and do not change, even though variations exist.]]
{{main|Great chain of being}}

When observers in the [[Early Modern]] period began to develop systems of organization for living things, they placed each kind of animal or plant into a context. Many of these early delineation schemes would now be considered whimsical: schemes included consanguinity based on colour (all plants with yellow flowers) or behaviour (snakes, scorpions and certain biting ants). [[John Ray]], an English naturalist, was the first to attempt a biological definition of species in 1686, as follows:

{{quote|No surer criterion for determining species has occurred to me than the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation from seed. Thus, no matter what variations occur in the individuals or the species, if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant, they are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species&amp;nbsp;... Animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct species permanently; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=John |author-link=John Ray |title=Historia plantarum generalis, Tome I, Libr. I |date=1686&lt;!--that volume--&gt; |page=Chap. XX, page 40}}, quoted in {{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |year=1982 |title=The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution, and inheritance |url=https://archive.org/details/growthofbiologic00mayr |url-access=registration |publisher=Belknap Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/growthofbiologic00mayr/page/256 256]|isbn=9780674364455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Carl von Linné.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Linnaeus]] created the binomial system for naming species.]]

In the 18th century, the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] classified organisms according to shared physical characteristics, and not simply based upon differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=P. H. |last2=Heywood |first2=V. H. |year=1973 |title=Principles of Angiosperm Taxonomy |location=Huntington, NY |publisher=Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the idea of a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[hierarchy]] of classification based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=James L. |last1=Reveal |first2=James S. |last2=Pringle |title=Flora of North America |year=1993 |chapter=7.

This view was influenced by European scholarly and religious education, which held that the categories of life are dictated by God, forming an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] hierarchy, the [[Great chain of being#The Great Chain in natural science|''scala naturae'' or great chain of being]]. However, whether or not it was supposed to be fixed, the ''scala'' (a ladder) inherently implied the possibility of climbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahoney |first=Edward P. |title=Lovejoy and the Hierarchy of Being |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=211–230 |doi=10.2307/2709555 |jstor=2709555 |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mutability ===
In viewing evidence of hybridisation, Linnaeus recognised that species were not fixed and could change; he did not consider that new species could emerge and maintained a view of divinely fixed species that may alter through processes of hybridisation or acclimatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |access-date=24 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430160025/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |archive-date=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, naturalists understood that species could change form over time, and that the history of the planet provided enough time for major changes. [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], in his 1809 ''Zoological Philosophy'', described the [[transmutation of species]], proposing that a species could change over time, in a radical departure from Aristotelian thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |year=2002 |publisher=Belknap Harvard |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/structureofevolu00goul/page/170 170–197] |title-link=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] provided a compelling account of [[evolution]] and the formation of new species. Darwin argued that it was populations that evolved, not individuals, by [[natural selection]] from naturally occurring variation among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |author-link=Peter J. Bowler |year=2003 |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |edition=3rd |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutionhistory0000bowl_n7y8/page/177 177–223 and passim] |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionhistory0000bowl_n7y8/page/177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This required a new definition of species. Darwin concluded that species are what they appear to be: ideas, provisionally useful for naming groups of interacting individuals, writing:
{{quote|I look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other&amp;nbsp;... It does not essentially differ from the word variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for convenience sake.&lt;ref name="metaphysical"&gt;{{cite book |last=Menand |first=Louis |title=The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America |year=2001 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0-374-70638-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/metaphysicalclub00mena/page/123 123–124] |title-link=The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--end quote--&gt;

'''Sperm precedence''', also known as '''sperm predominance''', is tendency of a female who has been bred by multiple males to give birth to their offspring in unequal proportions. Sperm precedence is an important factor in the [[sperm competition]].

Sperm precedence can be temporal, favoring either the first or last male to breed the female. (The former is known as ''first sperm precedence'' and the latter is known as ''last sperm precedence''); or it can favor the male whose sperm [[sperm motility|are the most motile]]; or the male whose sperm were delivered closest to the female's [[Ovum|ova]]. First male sperm precedence is seen in a variety of species, including the common crab spider, ''Misumena vatia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morse|first=Douglass H.|title=Male mate choice and female response in relation to mating status and time since mating|url=https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fbeheco%2Farp183|journal=Behavioral Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spermicide''' is a [[contraceptive]] substance that destroys [[spermatozoon|sperm]], inserted vaginally prior to [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] to prevent [[pregnancy]]. As a contraceptive, spermicide may be used alone.  However, the pregnancy rate experienced by couples using only spermicide is higher than that of couples using other methods.  Usually, spermicides are combined with contraceptive [[barrier methods]] such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[condom]]s, [[cervical cap]]s, and [[contraceptive sponge|sponges]].  Combined methods are believed to result in lower pregnancy rates than either method alone.&lt;ref name="simultaneous"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kestelman P, Trussell J |title=Efficacy of the simultaneous use of condoms and spermicides | journal = Fam Plann Perspect | volume = 23 | issue = 5 |pages=226–7, 232 |year=1991| pmid = 1743276 | doi = 10.2307/2135759 |jstor=2135759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spermicides are typically unscented, clear, unflavored, non-staining, and lubricative.

==Types and effectiveness==
The most common active ingredient of spermicides is [[nonoxynol-9]]. Spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 are available in many forms, such as jelly (gel), films, and foams. Used alone, spermicides have a perfect use failure rate of 6% per year when used correctly and consistently, and 16% failure rate per year in typical use.&lt;ref name="Grimes 2013"/&gt;

[[Nonoxynol-9]] is the primary chemical in spermicides to inhibit sperm motility. Active secondary spermicidal ingredients can include octoxynol-9, benzalkonium chloride and menfegol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Health Organization|title=WHO/Conrad Technical Consultation|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2003/WHO_RHR_03.08.pdf|publisher=Geneva|access-date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These secondary ingredients are not mainstream in the United States, where nonoxynol-9 alone is typical.  Preventing sperm motility will inhibit the sperm from travelling towards the egg moving down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. The deep proper insertion of spermicide should effectively block the cervix so that sperm cannot make it past the cervix to the uterus or the Fallopian tubes.  A study observing the distribution of spermicide containing nonoxynol-9 in the vaginal tract showed “After 10 min the gel spread within the vaginal canal providing a contiguous covering of the epithelium of variable thickness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnhart |first1=K.T. |title=Distribution of a spermicide containing Nonoxynol-9 in the vaginal canal and the upper female reproductive tract |journal=Human Reproduction |date=1 June 2001 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=1151–1154 |doi=10.1093/humrep/16.6.1151 |pmid=11387285 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sole goal of spermicide is to prevent fertilization.

Menfegol is a spermicide manufactured as a foaming tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spermicides: Neo-Sampoon (Menfegol) |work=RemedyFind |url=http://www.remedyfind.com/treatments/77/1301/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610181737/http://www.remedyfind.com/treatments/77/1301/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-06-10 |access-date=2006-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available only in Europe.

[[Octoxynol-9]] was previously a common spermicide, but was removed from the U.S. market in 2002 after manufacturers failed to perform new studies required by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Status of Certain Additional Over-the-Counter Drug Category II and III Active Ingredients |work=Federal Register |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=May 9, 2002 |url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/050902b.htm |access-date=2006-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use with condoms==
Spermicides are believed to increase the contraceptive effectiveness of condoms.&lt;ref name="simultaneous" /&gt;

However, condoms that are spermicidally lubricated by the manufacturer have a shorter shelf life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spermicide (Nonoxynol-9) |work=Other disadvantages |url=http://www.condomjungle.com/Spermicidal_Nonoxynol_9_Lubricated_Condoms_s/61.htm |access-date=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may cause urinary tract infections in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condoms: Extra protection |work=ConsumerReports.org |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/health-care/condoms-and-contraception-205/overview/index.htm |access-date=2006-08-06 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060626055716/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/health-care/condoms-and-contraception-205/overview/index.htm |archive-date = June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted.  However, they recommend using a nonoxynol-9 lubricated condom over no condom at all.&lt;ref name="WHO 2002"&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|year=2002|title=HIV/AIDS Topics: Microbicides|url=https://www.who.int/hiv/topics/microbicides/microbicides/en/|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=August 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spermicides used alone are only about 91 percent effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WebMD|title=Spermicide for Birth Control - Topic Overview|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/tc/spermicide-for-birth-control-topic-overview|website=WebMD|access-date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When spermicides are used in conjunction with condoms and other barrier methods there is a 97 percent effective rate for pregnancy prevention.

==Side effects==
Temporary local skin irritation involving the vulva, vagina, or penis is the most common problem associated with spermicide use.&lt;ref name="Cates 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cates|first1=Willard Jr.|last2=Harwood|first2=Bryna|year=2011|chapter=Vaginal Barriers and Spermicides|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.|title=Contraceptive Technology|edition=20th revised|location=New York|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0|issn=0091-9721|oclc=781956734|pages=391–408}} p. 399:&lt;blockquote&gt;Currently available spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 are ineffective as microbicides, in particular as HIV-preventive measures.&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, spermicides used alone are not recommended to prevent HIV or other STIs. Furthermore, frequent use (more than 2 times a day) of spermicide causes more vulvovovaginal epithelial disruption,&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; which theoretically could increase susceptibility to HIV. In a high-risk population using a vaginal gel with nonoxynol-9 more than three applications per day on average, the risk of HIV acquisition was ''increased'' compared with placebo.&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;p.399–400:&lt;blockquote&gt;Disadvantages and cautions&lt;br/&gt;Local irritation&lt;br/&gt;Temporary skin irritation involving the vulva, vagina, or penis caused by either local toxicity or allergy to the formulation is the most common problem associated with spermicide use... Although vaginal epithelial disruption has been associated with frequent use (twice a day or more) of spermicides containing N-9, this is usually asymptomatic. In a low risk population, long-term use of N-9 containing methods was not associated with epithelial disruption.&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;p. 401:&lt;blockquote&gt;N-9 spermicides are inadvisable if STI/HIV exposure is likely in situations that would involve frequent use defined as 2 times or more a day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequent use (two times or more a day) of [[nonoxynol-9]] containing spermicide is inadvisable if STI/HIV exposure is likely, because in this situation there is increased vulvovaginal epithelial disruption and increased risk of HIV acquisition.&lt;ref name="Cates 2011"/&gt;

In 2007, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) mandated that labels for nonoxynol-9 [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] (OTC) contraceptive products carry a new warning saying they do not protect against STDs and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="FDA 2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=FDA|date=December 18, 2007|title=FDA mandates new warning for nonoxynol 9 OTC contraceptive products.

==History==
The first written record of spermicide use is found in the [[Kahun Papyrus]],&lt;!-- or Petri Papyrus?  Sources for these (two?) documents seem to be pretty sketchy --&gt; an Egyptian document dating to 1850 BCE.  It described a [[pessary]] of crocodile dung and fermented dough.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2000 |title=Evolution and Revolution: The Past, Present, and Future of Contraception |journal=Contraception Online (Baylor College of Medicine) |volume=10 |issue=6 |url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=93 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926032018/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=93 |archive-date=September 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that the low [[pH]] of the dung may have had a spermicidal effect.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web |last=Towie |first=Brian |title=4,000 years of contraception on display in Toronto museum |work=torontObserver |publisher=Centennial College journalism students |date=January 19, 2004 |url=http://observer.thecentre.centennialcollege.ca/features/condom_museum011904.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20040225190349/http://observer.thecentre.centennialcollege.ca/features/condom_museum011904.htm |archive-date=February 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further formulations are found in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] from approximately 1500 BCE.  It recommended mixing seed wool, acacia, dates and honey, and placing the mixture in the vagina. It probably had some effectiveness, in part as a physical barrier due to the thick, sticky consistency, and also because of the [[lactic acid]] (a known spermicide) formed from the acacia.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt;

Writings by [[Soranus (Greek physician)|Soranus]], a 2nd-century Greek physician, contained formulations for a number of acidic concoctions claimed to be spermicidal.  His instructions were to soak wool in one of the mixtures, then place near the cervix.&lt;ref name="evolution" /&gt;

Laboratory testing of substances to see if they inhibited sperm motility began in the 1800s.  Modern spermicides nonoxynol-9 and menfegol were developed from this line of research.&lt;ref name="evolution" /&gt; However, many other substances of dubious contraceptive value were also promoted.  Especially after the prohibition of contraception in the U.S. by the 1873 [[Comstock laws|Comstock Act]], spermicides—the most popular of which was [[Lysol]]—were marketed only as "feminine hygiene" products and were not held to any standard of effectiveness.  Worse, many manufacturers recommended using the products as a [[douche]] ''after'' intercourse, too late to affect all the sperm.  Medical estimates during the 1930s placed the pregnancy rate of women using many over-the-counter spermicides at seventy percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tone |first1=Andrea |title=Contraceptive Consumers: Gender and the Political Economy of Birth Control in the 1930s |journal=Journal of Social History |date=1996 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=485–506 |doi=10.1353/jsh/29.3.485 |id={{GALE|A18498205}} |jstor=3788942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A misconception about spermicides existed in the 1980s and 1990s. A 1988 literature review article noted that ''in vitro'' studies of nonoxynol-9 and other spermicides showed inactivation of STI pathogens, including HIV.&lt;ref name="Feldblum 1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Feldblum |first1=P J |last2=Fortney |first2=J A |title=Condoms, spermicides, and the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus: a review of the literature. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=January 1988 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=52–54 |doi=10.2105/ajph.78.1.52 |pmid=3276230 |pmc=1349207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But a 2002 systemic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials of vaginal nonoxynol-9 for HIV and STI prevention involving more than 5,000 women (predominantly sex workers) found no statistically significant reduction in risk of HIV and STIs, but found a small statistically significant increase in genital lesions among nonoxynol-9 spermicide users.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=David|last2=Tholandi|first2=Maya|last3=Ramjee|first3=Gita|last4=Rutherford|first4=George W.|date=October 2002|title=Nonoxynol-9 spermicide for prevention of vaginally acquired HIV and other sexually transmitted infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials including more than 5000 women|journal=Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=2|issue=10|pages=613–617|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00396-1|pmid=12383611}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in a high-risk population using a nonoxynol-9 vaginal gel more than three applications per day on average, the risk of HIV acquisition was increased.&lt;ref name="Cates 2011"/&gt;

The media used was a purple color to illustrate the resulting pattern, normally a transparent media would be used.]]

A '''spiral plater''' is an instrument used to dispense a liquid sample onto a [[Petri dish]] in a [[spiral]] pattern. Commonly used as part of a [[Colony-forming unit|CFU]] count procedure for the purpose of determining the number of microbes in the sample.&lt;ref name="initial article"&gt;J. E. Gilchrist, J. E. Campbell, C. B. Donnelly, J. T. Peeler, and J. M. Delaney  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4632851 "Spiral Plate Method for Bacterial Determination"],  ''[[Appl Microbiol. ]]'', 1973 February; 25(2): 244–252., {{PMC|380780}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, after spiral plating, the Petri dish is incubated for several hours after which the number of colony forming microbes (CFU) is determined. Spiral platers are also used for research, clinical diagnostics and as a method for covering a Petri dish with [[bacteria]] before placing antibiotic discs for [[Antibiotic sensitivity|AST]].

== Mode of action ==
The spiral plater rotates the dish while simultaneously dispensing the liquid and either [[linear motion|linearly moving]] the dish or the dispensing tip. This creates the common spiral pattern. If all movements are done in constant speed, the spiral created would have a lower concentration on the outside of the plate than on the inside. More advanced spiral platers provide different options for spiral patterns such as constant concentration (by slowing down the spinning and / or the lateral movements) or exponential concentration (by speeding up the spinning and / or the lateral movements).

== In food and cosmetic testing ==
Spiral plating is used extensively for microbiological testing of food, milk and milk products and cosmetics. It is an approved method by the FDA.&lt;ref name="fda bam"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/ucm063346.htm |title=BAM: Aerobic Plate Count |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of spiral plating is less plates used versus plating manually because different concentrations are present on each plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/magazine-archive1/junejuly-2011/advances-in-spiral-plating-increase-reproducibility-and-cost-savings/ |title=Advances in Spiral Plating Increase Reproducibility and Cost Savings |publisher=Food Safety Magazine |date= 2012-11-08|accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="initial article"/&gt; This also makes it harder to count the colonies and requires special techniques and equipment.&lt;ref name="fda bam"/&gt;

== Stand-alone vs. Add-on ==
Spiral platers are either available as stand-alone instruments that are fed manually with plates and samples or fed automatically using dedicated stackers. Alternatively spiral platers are available as integrated devices as part of larger automated platforms. In this case a larger workflow is often automated, e.g. plating, [[Incubator (culture)|incubation]] and [[Colony counter|counting]].

{{Orphan|date=August 2015}}

'''Split-intein circular ligation of peptides and proteins''' ('''SICLOPPS''') is a [[biotechnology]] technique that permits the creation of [[cyclic peptide]]s.  These peptides are produced by [[ribosomal]] [[protein synthesis]], followed by an [[intein]]-like event that splices the protein into a loop.  By contrast with the [[nonribosomal peptide synthetase]]s that produces some cyclic peptides like [[gramicidin S]], SICLOPPS offers the advantage that the peptides' structure can be encoded by DNA in a simple manner according to the [[genetic code]], but for this reason it imposes limitations on the types of [[amino acid]]s incorporated that are comparable to those that apply to ordinary [[protein]]s.  As implemented there is also some constraint on the [[peptide sequence]] of the cyclic sequence; for example, libraries may use the sequence [[serine|S]][[glycine|G]]XX..XX[[proline|P]][[leucine|L]] to increase the efficiency of circularization of the peptide.&lt;ref name=Nilsson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cell-Based Assay To Identify Inhibitors of the Hfq-sRNA Regulatory Pathway|author1=Shaima A. El-Mowafi |author2=John N. Alumasa |author3=Sarah E. Ades |author4=Kenneth C. Keiler  |name-list-style=amp |journal=Antimicrob.

A number of natural [[antimicrobial peptide]]s are cyclic, and the products of SICLOPPS are "increasingly viewed as ideal backbones for modulation of protein-protein interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peptides come round: using SICLOPPS libraries for early stage drug discovery.|author=Lennard KR1, Tavassoli A.|journal=Chemistry|date=2014-08-18|volume=20|issue=34|pages=10608–14|doi=10.1002/chem.201403117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Circular peptides tend to be resistant to [[protease]] activity, and may be suitable for use as [[orally administered]] drugs.  Once a cyclic peptide is identified with a biological activity of interest, it may also be possible to identify the target of the peptide (a gene that encodes a protein with which it interacts) by [[functional complementation]], facilitating a better understanding of its [[mechanism of action]].&lt;ref name=Nilsson&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://faculty.unlv.edu/eabelsantos/Papers/USING%20SICLOPPS%20FOR%20THE%20DISCOVERY%20OF%20NOVEL%20ANTIMICROBIAL%20PE%85.pdf|title=Using SICLOPPS for the discovery of novel antimicrobial peptides and their targets|author1=Lisa O.

'''Squalene''' is an [[organic compound]]. It is a [[triterpenoid]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a colourless oil, although impure samples appear yellow. It was originally obtained from [[shark liver oil]] (hence its name, as ''[[Squalus]]'' is a genus of sharks). All plants and animals produce squalene as a biochemical intermediate to sterol biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=who.int&gt;{{cite news|title=Squalene-based adjuvants in vaccines|url=https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/adjuvants/squalene/questions_and_answers/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104105400/http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/adjuvants/squalene/questions_and_answers/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 4, 2012|work=Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 12% of bodily squalene in humans is found in [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronco|first1=Alvaro L.|last2=De Stéfani|first2=Eduardo|title=Squalene: a multi-task link in the crossroads of cancer and aging|journal=Functional Foods in Health and Disease|date=20 December 2013|volume=3|issue=12|pages=462–476|url=https://ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/30|doi=10.31989/ffhd.v3i12.30|doi-access=free|issn=2160-3855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squalene has a role in [[topical]] skin lubrication and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pappas|first=A|title=Epidermal surface lipids|journal=Dermato-Endocrinology|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|date=1 April 2009|volume=1|issue=2|pages=72–76|doi=10.4161/derm.1.2.7811|pmid=20224687|pmc=2835894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squalene is a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] for synthesis of all plant and animal [[sterol]]s, including [[cholesterol]] and [[steroid hormone]]s in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Micera|first1=Marco|last2=Botto|first2=Alfonso|last3=Geddo|first3=Federica|last4=Antoniotti|first4=Susanna|last5=Bertea|first5=Cinzia Margherita|last6=Levi|first6=Renzo|last7=Gallo|first7=Maria Pia|last8=Querio|first8=Giulia|title=Squalene: More than a Step toward Sterols|journal=Antioxidants|date=2 August 2020|volume=9|issue=8|page=688|doi=10.3390/antiox9080688|doi-access=free|pmid=32748847|pmc=7464659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squalene is an important ingredient in some [[vaccine]] [[adjuvants]]: The [[Novartis]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] adjuvants are called [[MF59]] and [[AS03]], respectively.

==Role in steroid synthesis==
Squalene is the biochemical precursor to [[steroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloch|first=Konrad E.|title=Sterol, Structure and Membrane Function|journal=[[Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]]|year=1983|volume=14|issue=1|pages=47–92|doi=10.3109/10409238309102790|pmid=6340956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squalene conversion begins with oxidation (via [[squalene monooxygenase]]) of one of its terminal double bonds, resulting in [[2,3-oxidosqualene]]. It then undergoes an enzyme-catalysed cyclisation to produce [[lanosterol]], which can be elaborated into other steroids such as [[cholesterol]] and [[ergosterol]] in a multistep process by the removal of three methyl groups, the reduction of one double bond by [[NADPH]] and the migration of the other double bond.{{cn|date=March 2022}}
{{clear|left}}

Squalene is an ancient molecule. In plants, squalene is the precursor to [[stigmasterol]]. In certain fungi, it is the precursor to [[ergosterol]]. However, [[blue-green algae]] and some bacteria do not produce squalene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apanetwork.com/newsletter/2021/the-difference-between-squalane-and-squalene|date=13 July 2020|website=apanetwork.com|accessdate=31 October 2021|title=The difference between Squalane and Squalene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Biosynthesis===
Squalene is biosynthesised by coupling two molecules of [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]]. The condensation requires NADPH and the enzyme [[squalene synthase]].

===Industry===
{{missing information|section|all routes currently used; market share of each|date=January 2022}}
Synthetic Squalene is prepared commercially from [[geranylacetone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann|last1=Eggersdorfer|first1=Manfred|title=Terpenes|year=15 June 2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a26_205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shark conservation {{anchor|Shark squalene}}===
In 2020, conservationists raised concerns about the potential slaughter of sharks to obtain squalene for a [[COVID-19 vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowman|first=Emma|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/10/922398246/a-coronavirus-vaccine-could-kill-half-a-million-sharks-conservationists-warn|title=A Coronavirus Vaccine Could Kill Half A Million Sharks, Conservationists Warn|website=[[NPR|National Public Radio]]|date=10 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===As an adjuvant in vaccines===
{{see also|AS03|MF59}}
[[Immunologic adjuvant]]s are substances, administered in conjunction with a [[vaccine]], that stimulate the [[immune system]] and increase the response to the vaccine. Squalene is not itself an adjuvant, but it has been used in conjunction with [[surfactant]]s in certain adjuvant formulations.&lt;ref name=who.int/&gt;

An adjuvant using squalene is [[Seqirus]]' proprietary [[MF59]], which is added to influenza vaccines to help stimulate the human body's immune response through production of [[CD4]] memory cells. It is the first oil-in-water [[influenza vaccine]] adjuvant to be commercialised in combination with a seasonal influenza virus vaccine. It was developed in the 1990s by researchers at [[Ciba-Geigy]] and [[Chiron Corporation|Chiron]]; both companies were subsequently acquired by Novartis.&lt;ref name=who.int/&gt; Novartis was later acquired by CSL Bering and created the company Seqirus. It is present in the form of an [[emulsion]] and is added to make the vaccine more immunogenic.&lt;ref name=who.int/&gt; However, the mechanism of action remains unknown. MF59 is capable of switching on a number of genes that partially overlap with those activated by other adjuvants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosca|first1=Frank J.|last2=Tritto|first2=Elaine|last3=Muzzi|first3=Alessandro|last4=Monaci|first4=Ernesto|last5=Bagnoli|first5=Franco|last6=Iavarone|first6=Claudia|last7=O'Hagan|first7=Derek|last8=Rappuoli|first8=Rino|last9=De Gregorio|first9=Ennio|title=Molecular and cellular signatures of human vaccine adjuvants|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |date=29 July 2008|volume=105|issue=30|pages=10501–10506|doi=10.1073/pnas.0804699105|pmid=18650390|pmc=2483233|bibcode=2008PNAS..10510501M|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; How these changes are triggered is unclear; to date, no receptors responding to MF59 have been identified. One possibility is that MF59 affects the cell behaviour by changing the lipid metabolism, namely by inducing accumulation of neutral lipids within the target cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalvodova|first=Lucie|title=Squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants perturb metabolism of neutral lipids and enhance lipid droplet formation|journal=[[Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications]]|date=12 March 2010|volume=393|issue=3|pages=350–355|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.12.062|pmid=20018176}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influenza vaccine called [https://www.fluad.ca/patient/en/index.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzPPnohR9VXZ2WLu-FjLHTTuYljtqZti7Qybbq-nr59zQ3gcvSBUwlwaAng1EALw_wcB FLUAD] which used MF59 as an adjuvant was approved for use in the US in people 65 years of age and older, beginning with the 2016-2017 flu season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/adjuvant.htm|title=FLUAD, Flu Vaccine With Adjuvant|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases]]|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[meta-analysis]] assessed data from 64 clinical trials of influenza vaccines with the squalene-containing adjuvant MF59 and compared them to the effects of vaccines with no adjuvant. The analysis reported that the adjuvanted vaccines were associated with slightly lower risks of chronic diseases, but that neither type of vaccines altered the rate of [[autoimmune diseases]]; the authors concluded that their data "supports the good safety profile associated with MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines and suggests there may be a clinical benefit over non-MF59-containing vaccines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pellegrini|first1=Michele|last2=Nicolay|first2=Uwe|last3=Lindert|first3=Kelly|last4=Groth|first4=Nicola|last5=Della Cioppa|first5=Giovanni|title=MF59-adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines: Integrated analysis from a large safety database|date=16 November 2009|journal=[[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]]|volume=27|issue=49|pages=6959–6965|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.08.101|pmid=19751689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[Toxicology]] studies indicate that in the concentrations used in [[cosmetics]], squalene has low acute toxicity, and is not a significant contact allergen or irritant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Squalane and Squalene|journal=International Journal of Toxicology|year=1982|volume=1|issue=2|pages=37–56|url=http://www.beauty-review.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Final-Report-on-the-Safety-Assessment-of-Squalane-and-Squalene.pdf|doi=10.3109/10915818209013146|s2cid=31454284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Zih-Rou|last2=Lin|first2=Yin-Ku|last3=Fang|first3=Jia-You|title=Biological and Pharmacological Activities of Squalene and Related Compounds: Potential Uses in Cosmetic Dermatology|journal=[[Molecules (journal)|Molecules]]|date=16 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=540–554|url=http://skinbio.com/squalene-skin.pdf|doi=10.3390/molecules14010540|pmid=19169201|pmc=6253993|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] and the [[US Department of Defense]] have both published extensive reports that emphasise that squalene is naturally occurring, even in oils of human fingerprints.&lt;ref name=who.int/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asano|first1=Keiji G.|last2=Bayne|first2=Charles K.|last3=Horsman|first3=Katie M.|last4=Buchanan|first4=Michelle V.|title=Chemical Composition of Fingerprints for Gender Determination|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|date=17 January 2002|volume=47|issue=4|pages=805–807|doi=10.1520/JFS15460J|pmid=12136987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO goes further to explain that squalene has been present in over 22 million flu vaccines given to patients in Europe since 1997 without significant vaccine-related adverse events.&lt;ref name=who.int/&gt;

Cells are differentially labeled by growing them in light medium with normal arginine (Arg-0, blue color) or medium with heavy arginine (Arg-6, red color). Metabolic incorporation of the amino acids into the proteins results in a mass shift of the corresponding peptides. This mass shift can be detected by a [[mass spectrometer]] as indicated by the depicted mass spectra. When both samples are combined, the ratio of peak intensities in the mass spectrum reflects the relative protein abundance.

==Procedure==
Two populations of cells are cultivated in [[cell culture]]. One of the cell populations is fed with [[growth medium]] containing normal [[amino acids]]. In contrast, the second population is fed with growth medium containing amino acids labeled with stable (non-radioactive) heavy [[isotope]]s. For example, the medium can contain [[arginine]] labeled with six [[carbon-13]] atoms (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) instead of the normal [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C).   When the cells are growing in this medium, they incorporate the heavy arginine into all of their proteins. Thereafter, all peptides containing a single arginine are 6 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]] heavier than their normal counterparts. Alternatively, uniform labeling with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N can be used. Proteins from both cell populations are combined and analyzed together by [[mass spectrometry]] as pairs of chemically identical peptides of different stable-isotope composition can be differentiated in a mass spectrometer owing to their mass difference.

== Pulsed SILAC ==
Pulsed SILAC (pSILAC) is a variation of the SILAC method where the labelled amino acids are added to the growth medium for only a short period of time. This allows monitoring differences in ''de novo'' protein production rather than raw concentration.&lt;ref name="pmid19053139"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwanhäusser B, Gossen M, Dittmar G, Selbach M | title = Global analysis of cellular protein translation by pulsed SILAC | journal = Proteomics | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–209 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19053139 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200800275 | s2cid = 23130202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;small&gt;NeuCode SILAC&lt;/small&gt; ==
Traditionally the level of multiplexing in SILAC was limited due to the number of SILAC isotopes available. Recently, a new technique called NeuCode (neutron encoding) SILAC, has augmented the level of multiplexing achievable with metabolic labeling (up to 4).&lt;ref name="pmid24938287"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merrill AE, Hebert AS, MacGilvray ME, Rose CM, Bailey DJ, Bradley JC, Wood WW, El Masri M, Westphall MS, Gasch AP, Coon JJ | display-authors = 6 | title = NeuCode labels for relative protein quantification | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 2503–2512 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24938287 | pmc = 4159665 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M114.040287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NeuCode amino acid method is similar to SILAC but differs in that the labeling only utilizes heavy amino acids. The use of only heavy amino acids eliminates the need for 100% incorporation of amino acids needed for SILAC. The increased multiplexing capability of NeuCode amino acids is from the use of mass defects from extra neutrons in the stable isotopes. These small mass differences however need to be resolved on high resolution mass spectrometers.

[[Image:Stained_microscope_slide.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A stained [[histological]] specimen, sandwiched between a glass [[microscope slide]].]]

'''Staining''' is a technique used to enhance contrast in samples, generally at the [[Microscope|microscopic]] level. [[Stain]]s and [[dye]]s are frequently used in [[histology]] (microscopic study of biological [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s), in [[cytology]] (microscopic study of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s), and in the [[medical]] fields of [[histopathology]], [[hematology]], and [[cytopathology]] that focus on the study and [[diagnoses]] of [[disease]]s at the microscopic level. Stains may be used to define [[biological tissues]] (highlighting, for example, [[muscle fiber]]s or [[connective tissue]]), [[cell (biology)|cell]] populations (classifying different [[blood cell]]s), or [[organelle]]s within individual cells.

In [[biochemistry]], it involves adding a class-specific ([[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and [[fluorescent tag]]ging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in [[flow cytometry]], and to flag [[protein]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s in [[gel electrophoresis]]. Light microscopes are used for viewing stained samples at high magnification, typically using bright-field or epi-fluorescence illumination.

Staining is not limited to only biological materials, since it can also be used to study the structure of other materials; for example, the [[lamellar]] structures of [[semi-crystalline polymer]]s or the domain structures of [[block copolymer]]s.

== ''In vivo'' vs ''In vitro'' ==
''[[In vivo]] staining'' (also called [[vital staining]] or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues. By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colours, their form ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.

''[[In vitro]]'' staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone.  Combined with specific protocols for [[fixation (histology)|fixation]] and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A [[counterstain]] is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.
* Crystal violet stains both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. Treatment with alcohol removes the crystal violet colour from gram negative organisms only. Safranin as counterstain is used to colour the gram negative organisms that got decolorised by alcohol.

While ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are "fixed". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the  already dead cells are called [[vital stain]]s (e.g. [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called [[supravital stain]]s (e.g. [[New Methylene Blue]] and [[brilliant cresyl blue]] for [[reticulocyte]] staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others.  Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. "reticulocyte" look versus diffuse "polychromasia"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from {{gaps|1|:|5|000}} to {{gaps|1|:|500|000}} (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.

== Preparation ==
The preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned. Some or all of the following procedures may be required.

'''[[Wet mount]]s''' are used to view live organisms and can be made using water and certain stains. The liquid is added to the slide before the addition of the organism and a coverslip is placed over the specimen in the water and stain to help contain it within the [[field of view]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Nina | name-list-style = vanc |title=Microbiology|publisher=OpenStax|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Fixation (histology)|Fixation]]''', which may itself consist of several steps, aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible.  Sometimes [[heat fixation]] is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate [[chemical bond]]s between [[protein]]s and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity.  Common fixatives  include [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], and/or [[picric acid]].  Pieces of tissue may be embedded in [[paraffin wax]] to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Pommerville JC |title= Fundamentals of Microbiology | volume = I |publisher= Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year= 2017 |pages=248, 249|isbn = 978-1-284-10095-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mordant]]s''' are chemical agents which have power of making dyes to stain materials which otherwise are unstainable

Mordants are classified into two categories:

a) Basic mordant: React with acidic dyes e.g. alum, ferrous sulfate, cetylpyridinium chloride etc.

b) Acidic mordant : React with basic dyes e.g. picric acid, tannic acid etc.

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''Direct Staining:''' Carried out without mordant.

'''Indirect Staining:''' Staining with the aid of a mordant.

'''Permeabilization''' involves treatment of cells with (usually) a mild [[surfactant]].  This treatment dissolves [[cell membrane]]s, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell's interior.

'''[[Microscope slide#Mounting|Mounting]]''' usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis.  In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide.  For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a [[pap smear]]) the sample can be directly applied to a slide.  For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a [[microtome]]; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.

=== Standardization ===

Most of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as '''BSC-certified stains'''. This means that samples of the manufacturer's batch have been tested by an independent body, the [[Biological Stain Commission]] ('''BSC'''), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques ensuring more accurately performed experiments and more reliable results. These standards are published in the commission's journal [[Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Penney DP, Powers JM, Frank M, Willis C, Churukian C | title = Analysis and testing of biological stains--the Biological Stain Commission Procedures | journal = Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry | volume = 77 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 237–75 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12564600 | doi = 10.1080/714028210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another. The use of BSC-certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results.&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan" /&gt;

Some vendors sell stains "certified" by themselves rather than by the Biological Stain Commission. Such products may or may not be suitable for diagnostic and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biologicalstaincommission.org/vendors-list/|title=Vendors List - The Biological Stain Commission|website=biologicalstaincommission.org|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative ===
[[File:HexLamMic phases.jpg|thumb|Example of [[negative staining]]]]
{{main|Negative staining}}
A simple staining method for bacteria that is usually successful, even when the [[#Positive staining|positive staining]] methods fail, is to use a [[negative stain]]. This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying [[nigrosin]] (a black synthetic dye) or [[India ink]] (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Clark G | date = 1981 | title = Staining Procedures | edition = 4th | location = Baltimore | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | page = 412 | isbn = 978-0-683-01707-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Negative staining is able to stain the background instead of the organisms because the cell wall of microorganisms typically has a negative charge which repels the negatively charged stain. The dyes used in negative staining are acidic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.

=== Positive ===
Unlike negative staining, positive staining uses basic dyes to color the specimen against a bright background. While [[chromophore]] is used for both negative and positive staining alike, the type of chromophore used in this technique is a positively charged ion instead of a negative one. The negatively charged cell wall of many microorganisms attracts the positively charged chromophore which causes the specimen to absorb the stain giving it the color of the stain being used. Positive staining is more commonly used than negative staining in microbiology. The different types of positive staining are listed below.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Simple versus differential ===
Simple Staining is a technique that only uses one type of stain on a slide at a time. Because only one stain is being used, the specimens (for positive stains) or background (for negative stains) will be one color. Therefore, simple stains are typically used for viewing only one organism per slide. Differential staining uses multiple stains per slide. Based on the stains being used, organisms with different properties will appear different colors allowing for categorization of multiple specimens. Differential staining can also be used to color different organelles within one organism which can be seen in [[endospore staining]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Techniques ==

=== Gram ===
{{main|Gram staining}}
[[Gram staining]] is used to determine gram status to classifying bacteria broadly based on the composition of their [[cell wall]]. Gram staining uses [[Gentian violet|crystal violet]] to stain cell walls, [[iodine]] (as a mordant), and a [[fuchsin]] or [[safranin]] counterstain to (mark all bacteria). Gram status, helps divide specimens of bacteria into two groups, generally representative of their underlying phylogeny. This characteristic, in combination with other techniques makes it a useful tool in clinical microbiology laboratories, where it can be important in early selection of appropriate [[antibiotic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Rebecca B.|last2=Steele|first2=John C. H.|date=2009-07-01|title=Impact of Reporting Gram Stain Results From Blood Cultures on the Selection of Antimicrobial Agents|url=https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article/132/1/5/1765499|journal=American Journal of Clinical Pathology|language=en|volume=132|issue=1|pages=5–6|doi=10.1309/AJCP9RUV0YGLBVHA|pmid=19864226|issn=0002-9173|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Since this is a summary article, the following paragraph is probably more appropriate for the main article. Also, this explanation is one of two main theories. I think neither has been empirically demonstrated to date (see https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article/132/1/5/1765499). --&gt;On most Gram-stained preparations, [[Gram-negative]] organisms appear red or pink due to their counterstain. Due to the presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet – iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. In addition, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.

=== Endospore ===
{{main|Endospore staining}}
[[Endospore staining]] is used to identify the presence or absence of [[endospore]]s, which make bacteria very difficult to kill.  Bacterial spores have proven to be difficult to stain as they are not permeable to aqueous dye reagents.&amp;nbsp; Endospore staining is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''. Prior to the development of more efficient methods, this stain was performed using the Wirtz method with heat fixation and counterstain. Through the use of malachite green and a diluted ratio of carbol fuchsin, fixing bacteria in osmic acid was a great way to ensure no blending of dyes. However, newly revised staining methods have significantly decreased the time it takes to create these stains. This revision included substitution of carbol fuchsin with aqueous Safranin paired with a newly diluted 5% formula of malachite green. This new and improved composition of stains was performed in the same way as before with the use of heat fixation, rinsing, and blotting dry for later examination. Upon examination, all endospore forming bacteria will be stained green accompanied by all other cells appearing red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaeffer AB, Fulton MD | title = A Simplified Method of Staining Endospores | journal = Science | volume = 77 | issue = 1990 | pages = 194 | date = February 1933 | pmid = 17741261 | doi = 10.1126/science.77.1990.194 | bibcode = 1933Sci....77..194S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ziehl-Neelsen ===
{{main|Ziehl–Neelsen stain}}

A [[Ziehl–Neelsen stain]] is an acid-fast stain used to stain species of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.

This stain is performed through the use of both red coloured [[carbol fuchsin]] that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as [[methylene blue]].

[[H&amp;E stain|Haematoxylin and eosin stain]]ing is frequently used in [[histology]] to examine thin tissue sections.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques|date=1982|publisher=Longman Group Limited |editor1-last=Bancroft |editor2-last=Stevens|editor2-first=Alan | name-list-style = vanc |editor1-first=John|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Haematoxylin]] stains cell nuclei blue, while [[eosin]] stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;  Eosin is strongly absorbed by [[red blood cell]]s, colouring them bright red. In a skillfully made H&amp;E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink.

=== Papanicolaou ===
{{main|Papanicolaou stain}}
[[Papanicolaou stain]]ing, or PAP staining, was developed to replace fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in hopes of decreasing staining times and cost without compromising quality. This stain is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from a variety of tissue types in various organs. PAP staining has endured several modifications in order to become a “suitable alternative” for FNAC. This transition stemmed from the appreciation of wet fixed smears by scientists preserving the structures of the nuclei opposed to the opaque appearance of air dried Romanowsky smears. This led to the creation of a hybrid stain of wet fixed and air dried known as the ultrafast papanicolaou stain. This modification includes the use of nasal saline to rehydrate cells to increase cell transparency and is paired with the use of alcoholic formalin to enhance colors of the nuclei. The papanicolaou stain is now used in place of cytological staining in all organ types due to its increase in morphological quality, decreased staining time, and decreased cost. It is frequently used to stain [[Pap smear]] specimens.&lt;ref name="Gill, 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gill|first1=Gary W. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Cytopreparation|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4614-4932-4|series=Essentials in Cytopathology|volume=12|pages=143–189|chapter=Papanicolaou Stain|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-4933-1_10|issn=1574-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a combination of [[haematoxylin]], [[Orange G]], [[eosin Y]], [[Light Green SF yellowish]], and sometimes [[Bismarck Brown Y]].&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill, 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thakur M, Guttikonda VR | title = Modified ultrafast Papanicolaou staining technique: A comparative study | journal = Journal of Cytology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–153 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28701828 | pmc = 5492752 | doi = 10.4103/JOC.JOC_23_16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PAS ===
{{main|Periodic acid–Schiff stain}}
[[Image:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus [[Histoplasma]].]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labce.com/spg949466_periodic_acid_schiff_pas_diagnostic_applications.aspx|title=Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS): Diagnostic Applications - LabCE.com, Laboratory Continuing Education|website=labce.com|access-date=2020-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Periodic acid-Schiff]] is a histology special stain used to mark [[carbohydrate]]s ([[glycogen]], [[glycoprotein]], [[proteoglycan]]s). PAS is commonly used on liver tissue where glycogen deposits are made which is done in efforts to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases. PAS is important because it can detect glycogen granules found in tumors of the ovaries and pancreas of the endocrine system, as well as in the bladder and kidneys of the renal system. Basement membranes can also show up in a PAS stain and can be important when diagnosing renal disease. Due to the high volume of carbohydrates within the cell wall of hyphae and yeast forms of fungi, the Periodic acid -Schiff stain can help locate these species inside tissue samples of the human body.

=== Masson ===
{{main|Masson's trichrome stain}}
[[Masson's trichrome]] is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol.  The recipe has evolved from Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding [[connective tissue]].  Most recipes produce red [[keratin]] and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of [[collagen]] and [[bone]], light red or pink staining of [[cytoplasm]], and black [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].

=== Romanowsky ===
{{main|Romanowsky stain}}
The [[Romanowsky stain]]s is considered a polychrome staining effect and is based on a combination of eosin plus (chemically [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] [[eosin]]) and demethylated [[methylene blue]] (containing its oxidation products [[azure A]] and [[azure B]]).  This stain develops varying colors for all cell structures (“Romanowsky-Giemsa effect) and thus was used in staining neutrophil polymorphs and cell nuclei. Common variants include [[Wright's stain]], [[Jenner's stain]], May-Grunwald stain, [[Leishman stain]] and [[Giemsa stain]].

All are used to examine [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]] samples.  They are preferred over H&amp;E for inspection of blood cells because different types of [[white blood cells|leukocytes]] (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished.  All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as [[malaria]].&lt;ref name = "Bezrukov_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bezrukov AV | title = Romanowsky staining, the Romanowsky effect and thoughts on the question of scientific priority | journal = Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–35 | date = 2017-01-02 | pmid = 28098484 | doi = 10.1080/10520295.2016.1250285 | s2cid = 37401579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Silver ===
[[Image:Histoplasma in granuloma gms.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gömöri methenamine silver stain]] demonstrating [[histoplasma]] (illustrated in black).]]
[[Silver stain]]ing is the use of [[silver]] to stain [[histologic section]]s. This kind of staining is important in the demonstration of [[protein]]s (for example type III [[collagen]]) and [[DNA]]. It is used to show both substances inside and outside [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Silver staining is also used in [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]].

''Argentaffin cells'' [[Redox|reduce]] silver solution to metallic silver after [[formalin]] [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]. This method was discovered by Italian [[Camillo Golgi]], by using a reaction between [[silver nitrate]] and [[potassium dichromate]], thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see [[Golgi's method]]). A''rgyrophilic cells'' reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. An example of this would be [[hydroquinone]] or formalin.

=== Sudan ===
{{main|Sudan stain}}
[[Sudan stain]]ing utilizes Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, often including [[lipid]]s. [[Sudan III]], [[Sudan IV]], [[Oil Red O]], [[Osmium tetroxide]], and [[Sudan Black B]] are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of [[fecal fat]] in diagnosing [[steatorrhea]].

=== Wirtz-Conklin ===
The Wirtz-Conklin stain is a special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye as the primary stain and safranin as the counterstain. Once stained, they do not decolourize. The addition of heat during the staining process is a huge contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corey L | title = Laboratory diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infections. Principles guiding the development of rapid diagnostic tests | journal = Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease | volume = 4 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 111S–119S | date = March 1986 | pmid = 3009082 | doi = 10.1016/s0732-8893(86)80049-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat helps open the spore's membrane so the dye can enter. The main purpose of this stain is to show germination of bacterial spores. If the process of germination is taking place, then the spore will turn green in color due to malachite green and the surrounding cell will be red from the safranin. This stain can also help determine the orientation of the spore within the bacterial cell; whether it being terminal (at the tip), subterminal (within the cell), or central (completely in the middle of the cell).

===Collagen hybridizing peptide===
{{main|Collagen hybridizing peptide}}
[[Collagen Hybridizing Peptide]] (CHP) staining allows for an easy, direct way to stain denatured collagens of any type (Type I, II, IV, etc.) regardless if they were damaged or degraded via enzymatic, mechanical, chemical, or thermal means. They work by refolding into the collagen triple helix with the available single strands in the tissue. CHPs can be visualized by a simple [[fluorescence microscope]].

== Common biological stains ==
Different stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas.  Some of the most common biological stains are listed below.  Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.

=== Acridine orange ===
[[Acridine orange]] (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells J | year = 1988 | title = A Technique for Staining the Superficial Cells of Plucked Hair Follicles and Other Solid Tissues | journal = Stain Technology | volume = 63 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Bismarck brown ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Tomov N, Dimitrov N |date=2017|title=Modified bismarck brown staining for demonstration of soft tissue mast cells |url= https://tru.uni-sz.bg/tsj/Vol15_N3_2017/2_N.Tomov.pdf|journal=Trakia Journal of Sciences |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=195–197 |doi=10.15547/tjs.2017.03.001 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck brown]] (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid [[mucin]]s. and an intense brown color to mast cells. One default of this stain is that it blots out any other structure surrounding it and makes the quality of the contrast low. It has to be paired with other stains&amp;nbsp; in order to be useful. Some complementing stains used alongside Bismark brown are Hematoxylin and Toluidine blue which provide better contrast within the histology sample.

=== Carmine ===
[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|[[Carmine]] staining of a parasitic flatworm.]]
[[Carmine]] is an intensely red dye used to stain [[glycogen]], while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain.  Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually [[aluminum]].

=== Coomassie blue ===
[[Coomassie brilliant blue|Coomassie blue]] (also brilliant blue) nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour.  It is often used in gel electrophoresis.

===Cresyl violet===

[[Cresyl violet stain|Cresyl violet]] stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically [[Nissl body|nissl]] bodies. Often used in brain research.

=== Crystal violet ===
[[Crystal violet]], when combined with a suitable mordant, stains [[cell wall]]s purple.  Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.

=== DAPI ===
[[DAPI]] is a [[fluorescent]] nuclear stain, excited by [[ultraviolet]] light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to [[DNA]].  DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Levenfus I | title = An efficient method for counting DAPI-stained cells using Fiji | publisher = Grin | location = Munich | date = 2011 | isbn = 978-3-640-86284-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eosin ===
[[Eosin]] is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to [[cytoplasm]]ic material, [[cell membrane]]s, and some extracellular structures.  It also imparts a strong red colour to [[red blood cell]]s.  Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols.  There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin.  Most often used is [[eosin Y]] (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast.  The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast.  The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.

=== Ethidium bromide ===
[[Ethidium bromide]] [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]] and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of [[apoptosis]] – such cells have much more permeable [[biological membrane|membranes]]. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in [[gel electrophoresis]]. The stain may also be used in conjunction with [[acridine orange]] (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.

=== Acid fuchsin ===
[[Fuchsine|Acid fuchsine]] may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].
Acid fuchsin is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid fuchsin stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome.  In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsin imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsin is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).

=== Haematoxylin ===
[[Haematoxylin]] (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;  Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;  It is most often used with eosin in the [[H&amp;E stain]] (haematoxylin and eosin) staining, one of the most common procedures in [[histology]].&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;

=== Hoechst stains ===
[[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] is a ''bis''-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the ''minor groove'' of [[DNA]]. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]]: ''Hoechst 33258'' and ''Hoechst 33342''. The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal [[hydroxyl]] group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the [[plasma membrane]]. Hoechst 33342 contains an [[ethyl group|ethyl]] substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage

=== Iodine ===
[[Iodine]] is used in [[chemistry]] as an indicator for [[starch]]. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as [[Gram staining]], used in [[microbiology]]. Used as a [[mordant]] in Gram's staining, iodine enhances the entrance of the dye through the pores present in the cell wall/membrane.

[[Lugol's iodine|Lugol's solution]] or Lugol's iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] more visible.

Used with common vinegar (acetic acid), Lugol's solution is used to identify [[Cervical cancer#Diagnosis|pre-cancerous and cancerous changes]] in cervical and vaginal tissues during "Pap smear" follow up examinations in preparation for biopsy. The acetic acid causes the abnormal cells to blanch white, while the normal tissues stain a mahogany brown from the iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 4: An introduction to colposcopy: indications for colposcopy, instrumentation, principles and documentation of results | title = Colposcopy and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a beginners' manual | veditors = Sellors JW, Sankaranarayanan R | url =  https://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&amp;chap=4 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190131040048/https://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&amp;chap=4 | archive-date = 31 January 2019 | publisher = The World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malachite green ===
[[Malachite green]] (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the [[Gimenez stain|Gimenez staining technique]] for bacteria.  It can also be used to directly stain [[endospore|spores]].

=== Methyl green ===
[[Methyl green]] is used commonly with bright-field, as well as fluorescence microscopes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieto D, Aparicio G, Morande PE, Zolessi FR | title = A fast, low cost, and highly efficient fluorescent DNA labeling method using methyl green | journal = Histochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 142 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–45 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24671497 | doi = 10.1007/s00418-014-1215-0 | s2cid = 11094194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed.

=== Methylene blue ===
[[Methylene blue]] is used to stain animal cells, such as human cheek cells, to make their nuclei more observable. Also used to stain  blood films in cytology.

=== Neutral red ===
[[Neutral red]] (or toluylene red) stains [[Nissl body|Nissl substance]] red.  It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.

=== Nile blue ===
[[Nile blue]] (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue.  It may be used with living cells.

=== Nile red ===
[[Nile red]] (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with [[sulfuric acid]].  This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue.  Nile red is a [[lipophilic]] stain; it will accumulate in [[lipid]] globules inside cells, staining them red.  Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.

=== Osmium tetroxide (formal name: osmium tetraoxide) ===
[[Osmium tetraoxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.

=== Propidium iodide ===
[[Propidium iodide]] is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining

=== Rhodamine ===
[[Rhodamine]] is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.

=== Safranine ===
[[Safranine]] (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye.  It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue [[polyanions]], including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Berlyn GP, Miksche JP (1976). ''Botanical Microtechnique and Cytochemistry''. Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Safranine should not be confused with saffron, an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen, to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal (including human) tissues.

The incorrect spelling "safranin" is in common use. The -ine ending is appropriate for safranine O because this dye is an amine.&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-1-85996-099-8 |title=Conn's Biological Stains: A Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Fluorochromes for Use in Biology and Medicine |year=2002 |editor-last1 = Horobin | editor-first1 = Richard | editor-last2 = Kiernan | editor-first2 = John | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker JR (1958).

==Stainability of tissues==
[[File:Eosinophilic, basophilic, chromophobic and amphophilic staining.png|thumb|Main staining types when using [[H&amp;E stain|hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)]].]]
Tissues which take up stains are called '''chromatic'''.  [[Chromosomes]] were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.

Positive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix ''-philic''. For example, tissues that stain with an [[azure stain]] may be referred to as [[azurophil]]ic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as [[Acidophile (histology)|acidophilic]] for tissues that stain by [[acidic]] stains (most notably [[eosin]]), [[basophilic]] when staining in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dyes, and ''amphophilic''&lt;ref&gt;[https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/amphophilic thefreedictionary.com &gt; amphophilic] Citing: ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', 3 ed. 2007 Elsevier, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, [[chromophobe|chromophobic]] tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.

== Electron microscopy ==
As in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in [[transmission electron microscopy]]. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.

===Phosphotungstic acid===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/negative-staining|title=Negative Staining {{!}} Central Microscopy Research Facility|website=cmrf.research.uiowa.edu|access-date=2020-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Phosphotungstic acid]] is a common [[negative stain]] for [[virus]]es, [[nerve]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other biological tissue materials. It is mostly used in a .5-2% ph form making it neutral and is paired with water to make an aqueous solution. Phosphotungstic acid is filled with electron dense matter that stains the background surrounding the specimen dark and the specimen itself light. This process is not the normal positive technique for staining where the specimen is dark and the background remains light.

=== Osmium tetroxide ===
[[Osmium tetroxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.  Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. {{chem|OsO|4}} is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.

=== Ruthenium tetroxide ===
[[Ruthenium tetroxide]] is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.

Other chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:
[[ammonium molybdate]], [[cadmium iodide]], [[carbohydrazide]], [[ferric chloride]], [[hexamine]], [[indium trichloride]], [[lanthanum(III) nitrate]], [[lead acetate]], [[lead citrate]], [[lead(II) nitrate]], [[periodic acid]], [[phosphomolybdic acid]], [[potassium ferricyanide]], [[potassium ferrocyanide]], [[ruthenium red]], [[silver nitrate]], [[silver proteinate]], [[sodium chloroaurate]], [[thallium nitrate]], [[thiosemicarbazide]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl nitrate]], and [[vanadyl sulfate]].

In [[multicellular organisms]], '''stem cells''' are [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]] or partially differentiated [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that can differentiate into various [[types of cells]] and [[Cell proliferation|proliferate]] indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell. They are the earliest type of cell in a [[cell lineage]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atala |first1=Anthony |last2=Lanza |first2=Robert | name-list-style = vanc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm-K_dKpjBAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA451|title=Handbook of Stem Cells|date=2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-385943-3|pages=452|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in both [[embryo]]nic and adult organisms, but they have slightly different properties in each. They are usually distinguished from [[progenitor cells]], which cannot divide indefinitely, and [[Precursor cell|precursor]] or blast cells, which are usually committed to differentiating into one cell type.

In [[mammals]], roughly 50–150 cells make up the [[inner cell mass]] during the [[blastocyst]] stage of [[embryonic development]], around days 5–14. These have stem-cell capability. ''[[In vivo]]'', they eventually differentiate into all of the body's cell types (making them [[pluripotent]]). This process starts with the differentiation into the three [[germ layers]] – the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]] – at the [[gastrulation]] stage. However, when they are isolated and [[Cell culture|cultured]] ''[[in vitro]]'', they can be kept in the stem-cell stage and are known as [[embryonic stem cells]] (ESCs).

[[Adult stem cells]] are found in a few select locations in the body, known as [[Stem-cell niche|niches]], such as those in the [[bone marrow]] or [[gonads]]. They exist to replenish rapidly lost cell types and are [[multipotent]] or unipotent, meaning they only differentiate into a few cell types or one type of cell. In mammals, they include, among others, [[hematopoietic stem cells]], which replenish blood and immune cells, [[basal cells]], which maintain the skin [[epithelium]], and [[mesenchymal stem cells]], which maintain bone, [[cartilage]], muscle and fat cells. Adult stem cells are a small minority of cells; they are vastly outnumbered by the progenitor cells and terminally differentiated cells that they differentiate into.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Canadian biologists [[Ernest McCulloch]], [[James Till]] and Andrew J. Becker at the [[University of Toronto]] and the Ontario Cancer Institute in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker AJ, McCulloch EA, Till JE | title = Cytological demonstration of the clonal nature of spleen colonies derived from transplanted mouse marrow cells | journal = Nature | volume = 197 | issue = 4866 | pages = 452–454 | date = February 1963 | pmid = 13970094 | doi = 10.1038/197452a0 | bibcode = 1963Natur.197..452B | hdl-access = free | hdl = 1807/2779 | s2cid = 11106827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siminovitch L, McCulloch EA, Till JE | title = The distribution of colony-forming cells among spleen colonies | journal = Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 327–336 | date = December 1963 | pmid = 14086156 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.1030620313 | hdl-access = free | hdl = 1807/2778 | s2cid = 43875977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|}}, the only established [[Stem-cell therapy|medical therapy using stem cells]] is [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Müller AM, Huppertz S, Henschler R | title = Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine: Astray or on the Path? | journal = Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 247–254 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27721700 | pmc = 5040947 | doi = 10.1159/000447748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; first performed in 1958 by French oncologist [[Georges Mathé]]. Since 1998 however, it has been possible to culture and differentiate human embryonic stem cells (in [[stem-cell lines]]). The process of isolating these cells has been [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]], because it typically results in the destruction of the embryo. Sources for isolating ESCs have been [[Stem cell laws|restricted]] in some European countries and Canada, but others such as the UK and China have promoted the research.&lt;ref name="Pew Intl"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ralston |first1=Michelle |title=Stem Cell Research Around the World |url=https://www.pewforum.org/2008/07/17/stem-cell-research-around-the-world/ |work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |date=17 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somatic cell nuclear transfer]] is a [[cloning]] method that can be used to create a cloned embryo for the use of its embryonic stem cells in stem cell therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tuch |first1=B.

These were termed [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] (iPSCs).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== History ==
The term ''stem cell'' was coined by [[Theodor Boveri]] and [[Valentin Haecker]] in late 19th century.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramalho-Santos |first1=Miguel |last2=Willenbring |first2=Holger |title=On the Origin of the Term 'Stem Cell' |journal=Cell Stem Cell |date=June 2007 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=35–38 |doi=10.1016/j.stem.2007.05.013 |pmid=18371332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering works in theory of blood stem cell were conducted in the beginning of 20th century by [[Artur Pappenheim]], [[Alexander Maximow]], [[Franz Ernst Christian Neumann]].&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt;

The key properties of a stem cell were first defined by [[Ernest McCulloch]] and [[James Till]] at the University of Toronto and the Ontario Cancer Institute in the early 1960s. They discovered the blood-forming stem cell, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), through their pioneering work in mice. McCulloch and Till began a series of experiments in which bone marrow cells were injected into irradiated mice. They observed lumps in the spleens of the mice that were linearly proportional to the number of bone marrow cells injected. They hypothesized that each lump (colony) was a clone arising from a single marrow cell (stem cell). In subsequent work, McCulloch and Till, joined by graduate student [[Andrew John Becker]] and senior scientist [[Louis Siminovitch]], confirmed that each lump did in fact arise from a single cell. Their results were published in ''Nature'' in 1963. In that same year, Siminovitch was a lead investigator for studies that found colony-forming cells were capable of self-renewal, which is a key defining property of stem cells that Till and McCulloch had theorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.usask.ca/articles/research/2018/the-accidental-discovery-of-stem-cells.php|title =The Accidental Discovery of Stem Cells|last1=MacPherson|first1=Colleen|website=USask News|publisher=University of Saskatchewan|access-date=3 December 2019|ref=1|name-list-style=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first therapy using stem cells was a [[bone marrow transplant]] performed by French oncologist [[Georges Mathé]] in 1958 on five workers at the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] who had been affected by a [[criticality accident]]. The workers all survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1958YUG1.html Vinca reactor accident, 1958] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127110604/http://johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1958YUG1.html|date=27 January 2011}}, compiled by Wm. Robert Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, embryonic stem (ES) cells were first isolated and successfully cultured using mouse blastocysts by British biologists [[Martin Evans]] and [[Matthew Kaufman]]. This allowed the formation of murine genetic models, a system in which the genes of mice are deleted or altered in order to study their function in pathology. By 1998, embryonic stem cells were first isolated by American biologist [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]], which made it possible to have new transplantation methods or various cell types for testing new treatments. In 2006, [[Shinya Yamanaka]]’s team in Kyoto, Japan converted fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells by modifying the expression of only four genes. The feat represents the origin of induced pluripotent stem cells, known as iPS cells.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2014/stem-cells-a-brief-history-and-outlook-2/|title=Stem Cells: A Brief History and Outlook|last1=Ferreira|first1=Leonardo|date=2014-01-03|website=Stem Cells: A Brief History and Outlook – Science in the News|publisher=WordPress|access-date=3 December 2019|ref=2|name-list-style=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties:
* Self-renewal: the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell growth]] and [[cell division]], known as [[cell proliferation]], while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
* [[Cell potency|Potency]]: the capacity to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either [[totipotency|totipotent]] or [[pluripotency|pluripotent]]—to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although [[multipotent]] or [[unipotent cell|unipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this, it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feedback mechanism.

===Self-renewal===
Two mechanisms ensure that a stem cell population is maintained (doesn't shrink in size):

1. [[Asymmetric cell division]]: a stem cell divides into one mother cell, which is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell, which is differentiated.

When a stem cell self-renews, it divides and does not disrupt the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.&lt;ref&gt;Shenghui, H. E., Nakada, D., &amp; Morrison, S. J. (2009). Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal. Annual Review of Cell and Developmental, 25, 377–406.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell grows and divides into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes [[mitosis]] and produces two stem cells identical to the original.

Stem cells use [[telomerase]], a protein that restores [[telomeres]], to protect their DNA and extend their cell division limit (the [[Hayflick limit]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cong YS, Wright WE, Shay JW | title = Human telomerase and its regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–425, table of contents | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12208997 | pmc = 120798 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ''[[in vitro]]'', using methods such as [[clonogenic assay]]s, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedenstein AJ, Deriglasova UF, Kulagina NN, Panasuk AF, Rudakowa SF, Luriá EA, Ruadkow IA | title = Precursors for fibroblasts in different populations of hematopoietic cells as detected by the in vitro colony assay method | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–92 | year = 1974 |id={{INIST|PASCAL7536501060}} {{NAID|10025700209}} | pmid = 4455512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedenstein AJ, Gorskaja JF, Kulagina NN | title = Fibroblast precursors in normal and irradiated mouse hematopoietic organs | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 267–274 | date = September 1976 | pmid = 976387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stem cells can also be isolated by their possession of a distinctive set of cell surface markers. However, ''in vitro'' culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells shall behave in a similar manner ''[[in vivo]]''. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Sekhar L, Bisht N |date=2006-09-01 |title=Stem Cell Therapy |journal=Apollo Medicine |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=271–276 |doi= 10.1016/S0976-0016(11)60209-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryonic==
{{Main|Embryonic stem cell}}

[[Embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) are the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] of a [[blastocyst]], formed prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] in the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, Waknitz MA, Swiergiel JJ, Marshall VS, Jones JM | title = Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5391 | pages = 1145–1147 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9804556 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145 | bibcode = 1998Sci...282.1145T | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[human embryonic development]] the [[blastocyst]] stage is reached 4–5 days after [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], at which time it consists of 50–150 cells. ESCs are [[pluripotent]] and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[endoderm]] and [[mesoderm]]. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult [[human body|body]] when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the [[extraembryonic membrane]]s or to the [[placenta]].

During embryonic development the cells of the inner cell mass continuously divide and become more specialized. For example, a portion of the ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as '[[neurectoderm]]', which will become the future [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott F. |title=Developmental Biology |date=2014 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-978-7 }}{{Page needed|date=January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in development, [[neurulation]] causes the neurectoderm to form the [[neural tube]].  At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes [[encephalization]] to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain.  At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a [[neural stem cell]].

The neural stem cells self-renew and at some point transition into [[radial glial cell|radial glial progenitor cells]] (RGPs). Early-formed RGPs self-renew by symmetrical division to form a reservoir group of [[progenitor cell]]s. These cells transition to a [[neurogenesis|neurogenic]] state and start to divide [[Asymmetric cell division|asymmetrically]] to produce a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics. The process of generating neurons from radial glial cells is called [[neurogenesis]]. The radial glial cell, has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall. It shares some [[glial]] characteristics, most notably the expression of [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakic P | title = Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology | journal = Nature Reviews.

Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages ([[neuron]]s, [[astrocyte]]s, and [[oligodendrocyte]]s), and thus their potency is restricted.&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"/&gt;

Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or '''human embryonic stem cells ''' '''(hES)''' derived from the early inner cell mass.  Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of [[gelatin]] as an [[extracellular matrix]] (for support) and require the presence of [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF) in serum media. A drug cocktail containing inhibitors to [[GSK3B]] and the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]], called 2i, has also been shown to maintain pluripotency in stem cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ying QL, Wray J, Nichols J, Batlle-Morera L, Doble B, Woodgett J, Cohen P, Smith A | title = The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7194 | pages = 519–523 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18497825 | pmc = 5328678 | doi = 10.1038/nature06968 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..519Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic [[fibroblasts]] and require the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2).&lt;ref&gt;

A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors [[Oct-4]], [[Homeobox protein NANOG|Nanog]], and [[Sox2]] form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency.&lt;ref&gt;

By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these specialized adult cells in detail to try to discern complications of diseases, or to study cell reactions to proposed new drugs.

Because of their combined abilities of unlimited expansion and pluripotency, embryonic stem cells remain a theoretically potential source for [[regenerative medicine]] and tissue replacement after injury or disease.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahla RS | title = Stem Cells Applications in Regenerative Medicine and Disease Therapeutics | journal = International Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 2016 | issue = 7 | pages = 1–24 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27516776 | pmc = 4969512 | doi = 10.1155/2016/6940283 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there are currently no approved treatments using ES cells.

Ethical considerations regarding the use of unborn human tissue are another reason for the lack of approved treatments using embryonic stem cells. Many nations currently have [[moratorium (law)|moratoria]] or limitations on either human ES cell research or the production of new human ES cell lines.

=== Mesenchymal stem cells ===
[[File:Human mesenchymal stem cells.gif|thumb|Human mesenchymal stem cells]]
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) or mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as medicinal signaling cells are known to be multipotent, which can be found in adult tissues, for example, in the muscle, liver, bone marrow and adipose tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells usually function as structural support in various organs as mentioned above, and control the movement of substances. MSC can differentiate into numerous cell categories as an illustration of adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes, derived by the mesodermal layer.&lt;ref name="Mesenchymal and induced pluripotent"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zomer HD, Vidane AS, Gonçalves NN, Ambrósio CE | title = Mesenchymal and induced pluripotent stem cells: general insights and clinical perspectives | journal =  Stem Cells and Cloning: Advances and Applications| volume = 8 | pages = 125–134 | date = 2015-09-28 | pmid = 26451119 | pmc = 4592031 | doi = 10.2147/SCCAA.S88036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the mesoderm layer provides an increase to the body’s skeletal elements, such as relating to the cartilage or bone. The term “meso” means middle, infusion originated from the Greek, signifying that mesenchymal cells are able to range and travel in early embryonic growth among the ectodermal and endodermal layers. This mechanism helps with space-filling thus, key for repairing wounds in adult organisms that have to do with mesenchymal cells in the dermis (skin), bone, or muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caplan AI | title = Mesenchymal stem cells | journal = Journal of Orthopaedic Research | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 641–650 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1870029 | doi = 10.1002/jor.1100090504 | s2cid = 22606668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesenchymal stem cells are known to be essential for regenerative medicine. They are broadly studied in [[List of countries by stem cell research trials|clinical trials]]. Since they are easily isolated and obtain high yield, high plasticity, which makes able to facilitate inflammation and encourage cell growth, cell differentiation, and restoring tissue derived from immunomodulation and immunosuppression. MSC comes from the bone marrow, which requires an aggressive procedure when it comes to isolating the quantity and quality of the isolated cell, and it varies by how old the donor. When comparing the rates of MSC in the bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow stroma, the aspirates tend to have lower rates of MSC than the stroma. MSC are known to be heterogeneous, and they express a high level of pluripotent markers when compared to other types of stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name="Mesenchymal and induced pluripotent"/&gt; MSCs injection leads to wound healing primarily through stimulation of angiogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Krasilnikova |first1=O.

=== Cell cycle control ===
{{Further|Cell cycle}}
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the ability to divide indefinitely while keeping their [[pluripotency]], which is made possible through specialized mechanisms of [[cell cycle]] control.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koledova Z, Krämer A, Kafkova LR, Divoky V | title = Cell-cycle regulation in embryonic stem cells: centrosomal decisions on self-renewal | journal = Stem Cells and Development | volume = 19 | issue = 11 | pages = 1663–1678 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20594031 | doi = 10.1089/scd.2010.0136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to proliferating [[somatic cell]]s, ESCs have unique cell cycle characteristics—such as rapid cell division caused by shortened [[G1 phase]], absent [[G2 phase|G0 phase]], and modifications in [[cell cycle checkpoint]]s—which leaves the cells mostly in [[S phase]] at any given time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barta T, Dolezalova D, Holubcova Z, Hampl A | title = Cell cycle regulation in human embryonic stem cells: links to adaptation to cell culture | journal = Experimental Biology and Medicine | volume = 238 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–275 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23598972 | doi = 10.1177/1535370213480711 | s2cid = 2028793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ESCs’ rapid division is demonstrated by their short doubling time, which ranges from 8 to 10 hours, whereas somatic cells have doubling time of approximately 20 hours or longer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaveri L, Dhawan J | title = Cycling to Meet Fate: Connecting Pluripotency to the Cell Cycle | language = en | journal = Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 6 | pages = 57 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29974052 | pmc = 6020794 | doi = 10.3389/fcell.2018.00057 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As cells differentiate, these properties change: G1 and G2 phases lengthen, leading to longer cell division cycles. This suggests that a specific cell cycle structure may contribute to the establishment of pluripotency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Particularly because G1 phase is the phase in which cells have increased sensitivity to differentiation, shortened G1 is one of the key characteristics of ESCs and plays an important role in maintaining undifferentiated [[phenotype]]. Although the exact molecular mechanism remains only partially understood, several studies have shown insight on how ESCs progress through G1—and &amp;nbsp;potentially other phases—so rapidly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The cell cycle is regulated by complex network of [[cyclin]]s, [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s (Cdk), [[cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor]]s (Cdkn), pocket proteins of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family, and other accessory factors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Foundational insight into the distinctive regulation of ESC cell cycle was gained by studies on mouse ESCs (mESCs).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; mESCs showed a cell cycle with highly abbreviated G1 phase, which enabled cells to rapidly alternate between M phase and S phase. In a somatic cell cycle, oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is observed in sequential action, which controls crucial regulators of the cell cycle to induce unidirectional transitions between phases: [[Cyclin D]] and Cdk4/6 are active in the G1 phase, while [[Cyclin E]] and [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 2|Cdk2]] are active during the late G1 phase and S phase; and [[Cyclin A]] and Cdk2 are active in the S phase and G2, while [[Cyclin B]] and [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 1|Cdk1]] are active in G2 and M phase.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, in mESCs, this typically ordered and oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is absent. Rather, the Cyclin E/Cdk2 complex is constitutively active throughout the cycle, keeping [[retinoblastoma protein]] (pRb) [[hyperphosphorylated]] and thus inactive. This allows for direct transition from M phase to the late G1 phase, leading to absence of D-type cyclins and therefore a shortened G1 phase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cdk2 activity is crucial for both cell cycle regulation and cell-fate decisions in mESCs; downregulation of Cdk2 activity prolongs G1 phase progression, establishes a somatic cell-like cell cycle, and induces expression of differentiation markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koledova Z, Kafkova LR, Calabkova L, Krystof V, Dolezel P, Divoky V | title = Cdk2 inhibition prolongs G1 phase progression in mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = Stem Cells and Development | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–194 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19737069 | doi = 10.1089/scd.2009.0065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In human ESCs (hESCs), the duration of G1 is dramatically shortened. This has been attributed to high mRNA levels of G1-related Cyclin D2 and Cdk4 genes and low levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression at G1, such as [[P21Cip1|p21&lt;sup&gt;CipP1&lt;/sup&gt;]], p27&lt;sup&gt;Kip1&lt;/sup&gt;, and p57&lt;sup&gt;Kip2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker KA, Ghule PN, Therrien JA, Lian JB, Stein JL, van Wijnen AJ, Stein GS | title = Self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells is supported by a shortened G1 cell cycle phase | journal = Journal of Cellular Physiology | volume = 209 | issue = 3 | pages = 883–893 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16972248 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.20776 | s2cid = 24908771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, regulators of Cdk4 and Cdk6 activity, such as members of the Ink family of inhibitors (p15, p16, p18, and p19), are expressed at low levels or not at all. Thus, similar to mESCs, hESCs show high Cdk activity, with Cdk2 exhibiting the highest kinase activity. Also similar to mESCs, hESCs demonstrate the importance of Cdk2 in G1 phase regulation by showing that G1 to S transition is delayed when Cdk2 activity is inhibited and G1 is arrest when Cdk2 is knocked down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However unlike mESCs, hESCs have a functional G1 phase. hESCs show that the activities of Cyclin E/Cdk2 and Cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes are cell cycle-dependent and the Rb checkpoint in G1 is functional.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

ESCs are also characterized by G1 checkpoint non-functionality, even though the G1 checkpoint is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. In response to [[DNA damage]], ESCs do not stop in G1 to repair DNA damages but instead, depend on S and G2/M checkpoints or undergo apoptosis. The absence of G1 checkpoint in ESCs allows for the removal of cells with damaged DNA, hence avoiding potential mutations from inaccurate DNA repair.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consistent with this idea, ESCs are hypersensitive to DNA damage to minimize mutations passed onto the next generation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Adult stem cells, also called [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] (from Greek σωματικóς, "of the body") stem cells, are stem cells which maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a stem cell |url=https://www.anthonynolan.org/patients-and-families/understanding-stem-cell-transplants/what-is-a-stem-cell |website=anthonynolan.org |publisher=Anthony Nolan |access-date=17 February 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in children, as well as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang Y, Jahagirdar BN, Reinhardt RL, Schwartz RE, Keene CD, Ortiz-Gonzalez XR, Reyes M, Lenvik T, Lund T, Blackstad M, Du J, Aldrich S, Lisberg A, Low WC, Largaespada DA, Verfaillie CM | title = Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow | journal = Nature | volume = 418 | issue = 6893 | pages = 41–49 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12077603 | doi = 10.1038/nature00870 | bibcode = 2002Natur.418...41J | s2cid = 47162269 | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/238520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three known accessible sources of [[autologous]] adult stem cells in humans:

Stem cells can also be taken from [[umbilical cord blood]] just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank their own blood for elective surgical procedures.{{fact|date=August 2021}}

The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]] as the use of [[embryonic stem cell]]s, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an [[embryo]]. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an [[autograft]]), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109104735/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-date=2009-01-09 |publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services |title=Stem Cell FAQ |date=2004-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing demand of human adult stem cells for both research and clinical purposes (typically 1–5 million cells per kg of body weight are required per treatment) it becomes of utmost importance to bridge the gap between the need to expand the cells in vitro and the capability of harnessing the factors underlying replicative senescence. Adult stem cells are known to have a limited lifespan in vitro and to enter replicative senescence almost undetectably upon starting in vitro culturing.&lt;ref name=Oliveira&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oliveira PH, da Silva CL, Cabral JM | title = Genomic Instability in Human Stem Cells: Current Status and Future Challenges | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 32 | issue = 11 | pages = 2824–2832 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1002/stem.1796 | pmid = 25078438 | s2cid = 41335566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amniotic==
Also called perinatal stem cells, these multipotent stem cells are found in [[amniotic fluid]] and umbilical cord blood. These stem cells are very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorigenic. [[Amniotic stem cells]] are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.&lt;ref&gt;

Amniotic stem cells are a topic of active research.

Use of stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] overcomes the ethical objections to using human embryos as a source of cells. [[Roman Catholic]] teaching forbids the use of embryonic stem cells in experimentation; accordingly, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper "[[Osservatore Romano]]" called amniotic stem cells "the future of medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vatican newspaper calls new stem cell source 'future of medicine' |url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/18555/vatican-newspaper-calls-new-stem-cell-source-future-of-medicine |work=Catholic News Agency |date=3 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Induced pluripotent==
{{Main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

Adult stem cells have limitations with their potency; unlike [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs), they are not able to differentiate into cells from all three [[germ layers]]. As such, they are deemed [[cell potency|multipotent]].

However, [[reprogramming]] allows for the creation of pluripotent cells, [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSCs), from adult cells. These are not adult stem cells, but somatic cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein [[transcription factors]], pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making human embryonic stem cells|newspaper=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10170972|date=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16466265|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|title=Skin Cells Can Become Embryonic Stem Cells| last1 = Brand | first1 = Madeleine | last2 = Palca | first2 = Joe | last3 = Cohen | first3 = Alex | name-list-style = vanc |date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec07/stemcells_11-20.html|title=Breakthrough Set to Radically Change Stem Cell Debate|publisher=[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]|date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration of induced pluripotent stem cells was conducted by [[Shinya Yamanaka]] and his colleagues at [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref name = "overview"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimbrel EA, Lanza R | title = Pluripotent stem cells: the last 10 years | journal = Regenerative Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 831–847 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27908220 | doi = 10.2217/rme-2016-0117 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the transcription factors [[Oct-4|Oct3/4]], [[Sox2]], [[c-Myc]], and [[Klf4]] to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "og Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–676 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 | hdl = 2433/159777 | s2cid = 1565219 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells.&lt;ref name= "2007 Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Tanabe K, Ohnuki M, Narita M, Ichisaka T, Tomoda K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 861–872 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18035408 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019 | hdl = 2433/49782 | s2cid = 8531539 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junying Yu]], [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]], and their colleagues at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human [[foreskin]].&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "wisconsin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu J, Vodyanik MA, Smuga-Otto K, Antosiewicz-Bourget J, Frane JL, Tian S, Nie J, Jonsdottir GA, Ruotti V, Stewart R, Slukvin II, Thomson JA | title = Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5858 | pages = 1917–1920 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18029452 | doi = 10.1126/science.1151526 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1917Y | s2cid = 86129154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were able to replicate [[Yamanaka]]'s finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.

Induced pluripotent stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells. They share many similar properties, such as [[pluripotency]] and differentiation potential, the expression of [[pluripotency]] genes, [[epigenetic]] patterns, [[embryoid body]] and [[teratoma]] formation, and viable [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]] formation,&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; but there are many differences within these properties. The chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more "closed" or methylated than that of ESCs.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; Similarly, the gene expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different origins.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; There are thus questions about the "completeness" of [[reprogramming]] and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this, inducing somatic cells to be pluripotent appears to be viable.

As a result of the success of these experiments, [[Ian Wilmut]], who helped create the first cloned animal [[Dolly the Sheep]], has announced that he will abandon [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] as an avenue of research.&lt;ref&gt;"His inspiration comes from the research by Prof [[Shinya Yamanaka]] at [[Kyoto University]], which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement." {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730031336/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-07-30|title=Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning| last = Highfield | first = Roger | name-list-style = vanc |date=2007-11-16|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPSCs has helped the field of medicine significantly by finding numerous ways to cure diseases. Since human IPSCc has given the advantage to make ''in vitro'' models to study toxins and pathogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maldonado M, Luu RJ, Ico G, Ospina A, Myung D, Shih HP, Nam J | title = Lineage- and developmental stage-specific mechanomodulation of induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation | journal = Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 216 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28962663 | pmc = 5622562 | doi = 10.1186/s13287-017-0667-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are [[pluripotent]]. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if [[reprogramming]] to pluripotency was "complete").&lt;ref name = "overview" /&gt; Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient.&lt;ref name="R&amp;D"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinton DA, Daley GQ | title = The promise of induced pluripotent stem cells in research and therapy | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7381 | pages = 295–305 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22258608 | pmc = 3652331 | doi = 10.1038/nature10761 | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..295R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen blood samples can be used as a valuable source of induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref name="pmid20621045"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staerk J, Dawlaty MM, Gao Q, Maetzel D, Hanna J, Sommer CA, Mostoslavsky G, Jaenisch R | title = Reprogramming of human peripheral blood cells to induced pluripotent stem cells | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–24 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20621045 | pmc = 2917234 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2010.06.002 | lay-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100703175036/http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre6604si-us-stemcells-frozen/ | lay-source = ScienceDaily }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection.&lt;ref name= "R&amp;D" /&gt; Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold great potential for future use in medical treatment and research.

=== Cell cycle control ===
The key factors controlling the cell cycle also regulate [[pluripotency]]. Thus, manipulation of relevant genes can maintain pluripotency and reprogram somatic cells to an induced pluripotent state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, reprogramming of somatic cells is often low in efficiency and considered [[stochastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen X, Hartman A, Guo S | title = Choosing Cell Fate Through a Dynamic Cell Cycle | journal = Current Stem Cell Reports | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 129–138 | date = 2015-09-01 | pmid = 28725536 | pmc = 5487535 | doi = 10.1007/s40778-015-0018-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the idea that a more rapid cell cycle is a key component of pluripotency, reprogramming efficiency can be improved. Methods for improving pluripotency through manipulation of cell cycle regulators include: overexpression of Cyclin D/Cdk4, phosphorylation of [[SOX2|Sox2]] at S39 and S253, overexpression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E, knockdown of Rb, and knockdown of members of the [[CIP/KIP|Cip/Kip]] family or the Ink family.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, reprogramming efficiency is correlated with the number of cell divisions happened during the stochastic phase, which is suggested by the growing inefficiency of reprogramming of older or slow diving cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindley C, Philpott A | title = The cell cycle and pluripotency | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 451 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–143 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23535166 | pmc = 3631102 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20121627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==
{{Main|Stem cell line}}
Lineage is an important procedure to analyze developing embryos. Since cell lineages shows the relationship between cells at each division. This helps in analyzing stem cell lineages along the way which helps recognize stem cell effectiveness, lifespan, and other factors. With the technique of cell lineage mutant genes can be analyzed in stem cell clones that can help in genetic pathways. These pathways can regulate how the stem cell perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=D.T. |last2=Morris |first2=L.X. |last3=Nystul |first3=T. |last4=Spradling |first4=A.C. |title=Lineage analysis of stem cells |journal=StemBook |year=2008 |doi=10.3824/stembook.1.33.1 |pmid=20614627 |url=https://www.stembook.org/node/542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beckmann |first1=Julia |last2=Scheitza |first2=Sebastian |last3=Wernet |first3=Peter |last4=Fischer |first4=Johannes C. |last5=Giebel |first5=Bernd |title=Asymmetric cell division within the human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment: identification of asymmetrically segregating proteins |journal=Blood |date=15 June 2007 |volume=109 |issue=12 |pages=5494–5501 |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-11-055921 |pmid=17332245 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular [[Stem-cell niche|niche]]. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in ''Drosophila'' germarium have identified the signals [[decapentaplegic]] and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xie |first1=Ting |last2=Spradling |first2=Allan C |title=decapentaplegic Is Essential for the Maintenance and Division of Germline Stem Cells in the Drosophila Ovary |journal=Cell |date=July 1998 |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=251–260 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81424-5 |pmid=9695953 |s2cid=11347213 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Song |first1=X. |last2=Zhu |first2=CH |last3=Doan |first3=C |last4=Xie |first4=T |title=Germline Stem Cells Anchored by Adherens Junctions in the Drosophila Ovary Niches |journal=Science |date=7 June 2002 |volume=296 |issue=5574 |pages=1855–1857 |doi=10.1126/science.1069871 |pmid=12052957 |bibcode=2002Sci...296.1855S |s2cid=25830121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapies==
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. [[Bone marrow transplant]] is a form of stem cell therapy that has been used for many years because it has proven to be effective in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Murnaghan for Explore Stem Cells. Updated: 16 December 2013  [http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/WhyPerformStemCellTransplant.html Why Perform a Stem Cell Transplant?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant Bone Marrow Transplantation and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation] In National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet web site.

Stem cell implantation may help in strengthening the left-ventricle of the heart, as well as retaining the heart tissue to patients who have suffered from heart attacks in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stamm C, Westphal B, Kleine HD, Petzsch M, Kittner C, Klinge H, Schümichen C, Nienaber CA, Freund M, Steinhoff G | display-authors = 6 | title = Autologous bone-marrow stem-cell transplantation for myocardial regeneration | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9351 | pages = 45–46 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12517467 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12110-1 | s2cid = 23858666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
Stem cell treatments may lower symptoms of the disease or condition that is being treated. The lowering of symptoms may allow patients to reduce the drug intake of the disease or condition. Stem cell treatment may also provide knowledge for society to further stem cell understanding and future treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Master Z, McLeod M, Mendez I | title = Benefits, risks and ethical considerations in translation of stem cell research to clinical applications in Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Medical Ethics | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–173 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17329391 | pmc = 2598267 | doi = 10.1136/jme.2005.013169 | jstor = 27719821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicians' creed would be to do no injury, and stem cells make that simpler than ever before. Surgical processes by their character are harmful. Tissue has to be dropped as a way to reach a successful outcome. One may prevent the dangers of surgical interventions using stem cells. Additionally, there's a possibility of disease, and whether the procedure fails, further surgery may be required. Risks associated with anesthesia can also be eliminated with stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Comprehensive Stem Cell Training Course|url=https://r3medicaltraining.com/events/comprehensive-stem-cell-training-course/|access-date=2021-05-15|website=R3 Medical Training|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of that, stem cells have been harvested from the patient's body and redeployed in which they're wanted. Since they come from the patient’s own body, this is referred to as an autologous treatment. Autologous remedies are thought to be the safest because there's likely zero probability of donor substance rejection.

===Disadvantages===
Stem cell treatments may require [[immunosuppression]] because of a requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.

Pluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated cells can create tissues other than desired types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moore KL, Persaud TV, Torchia MG | title = Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects. | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Saunders, Elsevier | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical concerns are also raised about the practice of using or researching embryonic stem cells. Harvesting cells from the blastocyst result in the death of the blastocyst. The concern is whether or not the blastocyst should be considered as a human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ethical Issues in Stem Cell Research |last1=Lo |first1=Bernard |last2=Parham |first2=Lindsay |journal=Endocrine Reviews |publisher=NIH |date=May 2009 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=204–213 |doi=10.1210/er.2008-0031 |pmid=19366754 |pmc=2726839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate on this issue is mainly a philosophical one, not a scientific one.

=== Stem cell tourism ===
Stem cell tourism is the industry in which patients (and sometimes their families) travel to another jurisdiction, to obtain stem cell procedures which are not approved but which are advertised on the Internet as proven cures.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Further|Consumer Watchdog vs. Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation}}

Some of the fundamental [[patent]]s covering human embryonic stem cells are owned by the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF) – they are patents 5,843,780, 6,200,806, and 7,029,913 invented by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James A. Thomson]]. WARF does not enforce these patents against academic scientists, but does enforce them against companies.&lt;ref name = "stemcellPatent"&gt;Regalado, Antonio, David P.

The term “sterkome” was first used Schaudinn in 1899 to describe the balls of undigested food remains produced by the testate amoeba ''Trichosphaerium sieboldi'', the foraminiferan ''Saccammina sphaerica'', and the gromiid ''Gromia dujardinii''.&lt;ref name="Schaudinn-1899"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schaudinn |first1=Fritz |title=Untersuchungen über den Generationswechsel von ''Trichosphaerium sieboldii'' Schn. |journal=Abhandlungen der Königl.

{{ou|Sterilization (disambiguation)}}

'''Sterilization''' refers to any process that removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of [[life]] (particularly [[microorganism]]s such as [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[spore]]s, and [[unicellular]] [[eukaryotic]] organisms) and other [[biological agent]]s such as [[prion]]s present in or on a specific surface, object, or fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/anthapha_def_a.html|title=Definitions|first=Ralph R.|last=Frerichs | name-list-style = vanc |website=www.ph.ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including [[heat]], [[chemical]]s, [[irradiation]], [[high pressure food preservation|high pressure]], and [[filtration]]. Sterilization is distinct from [[disinfection]], sanitization, and [[pasteurization]], in that those methods reduce rather than eliminate all forms of life and biological agents present. After sterilization, an object is referred to as being sterile or [[aseptic]].

==Applications==

===Foods===
One of the first steps toward modernized sterilization was made by [[Nicolas Appert]], who discovered that application of heat over a suitable period slowed the decay of foods and various liquids, preserving them for safe consumption for a longer time than was typical. [[Canning]] of foods is an extension of the same principle and has helped to reduce [[food borne illness]] ("food poisoning"). Other methods of sterilizing foods include [[food irradiation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dkNQqbXY3loC|title=Food irradiation: principles and applications| vauthors = Molins RA |year=2001|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|page=23|isbn=978-0-471-35634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Diehl JR |date=March 2002|title=Food irradiation—past, present and future|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|volume=63|issue=3–6|pages=211–215|doi=10.1016/s0969-806x(01)00622-3|issn=0969-806X|bibcode=2002RaPC...63..211D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high pressure ([[pascalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edPzm5KSMmYC|title=Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation|last=Brown|first=Amy Christian| name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|edition=3|isbn=978-0-495-10745-3|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine and surgery===
[[File:Joseph Lister c1855.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], a pioneer of [[antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]].]]
[[File:Der Apparat zur Sterilisierung der Operationsinstrumente - CH-BAR - 3240236.tif|thumb|Apparatus to sterilize surgical instruments (1914{{ndash}}1918)]]

In general, surgical instruments and medications that enter an already [[Asepsis|aseptic]] part of the body (such as the bloodstream, or penetrating the skin) must be sterile. Examples of such instruments include [[scalpel]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and [[artificial pacemaker]]s. This is also essential in the manufacture of [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] pharmaceuticals.

Preparation of injectable medications and intravenous [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]]s for [[fluid replacement]] therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of [[infection|adventitious agents]] after initial product sterilization.

Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are able to go under [[steam]] sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutala WA, Weber DJ | title = Disinfection and sterilization in health care facilities: what clinicians need to know | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 702–9 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15356786 | doi = 10.1086/423182 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low-temperature sterilization. [[Ethylene oxide]] gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]], [[peracetic acid]] immersion, [[ozone]]) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/13_0Sterilization.html] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft===
There are strict international rules to [[planetary protection|protect the contamination of Solar System bodies]] from biological material from Earth. Standards vary depending on both the type of mission and its destination; the more likely a planet is considered to be [[planetary habitability|habitable]], the stricter the requirements are.

Many components of instruments used on spacecraft cannot withstand very high temperatures, so techniques not requiring excessive temperatures are used as tolerated, including heating to at least {{Cvt|120|C|}}, chemical sterilization, oxidization, ultraviolet, and irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sci.esa.int/home/30313-no-bugs-please-this-is-a-clean-planet/ |title=No bugs please, this is a clean planet! |publisher=European Space Agency |date=30 July 2002 |access-date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantification==
The aim of sterilization is the reduction of initially present microorganisms or other potential pathogens. The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]], denoting the time needed to reduce the initial number &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; to one tenth (&lt;math&gt;10^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) of its original value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm071261.htm|title= Guidance for Industry: Biological Indicators|date= 4 October 2007|publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the number of microorganisms &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; after sterilization time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{N_0}= 10^{\left(-\frac{t}{D}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.
The D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type of microorganism, [[temperature]], [[water activity]], [[pH]] etc.. For steam sterilization (see below) typically the temperature, in degrees [[Celsius]], is given as an index.

Theoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the [[bioburden]] present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a [[sterility assurance level]] (SAL) equal to the probability of a non-sterile unit.

For high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility assurance level of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; is required by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat==

===Steam===
{{See also|Moist heat sterilization}}

Steam sterilization, also known as moist heat sterilization, uses heated [[saturated steam]] under [[pressure]] to inactivate or kill microorganisms via [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of macromolecules, primarily proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://biodifferences.com/difference-between-moist-heat-and-dry-heat-sterilization.html|title=Difference Between Moist Heat and Dry Heat Sterilization (with Comparison Chart) - Bio Differences|date=2018-02-22|work=Bio Differences|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is a faster process than dry heat sterilization. Steam sterilization is performed using an [[autoclave]], sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. The article is placed in the autoclave chamber, which is then sealed and heated using pressurized steam to a temperature set point for a defined period of time. Steam sterilization cycles can be categorized as either pre-vacuum or gravity displacement. Gravity displacement cycles rely on the lower density of the injected steam to force cooler, denser air out of the chamber drain.[https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/sterilization/steam.html] In comparison, pre-vacuum cycles draw a vacuum in the chamber to remove cool dry air prior to injecting saturated steam, resulting in faster heating and shorter cycle times. Typical steam sterilization cycles are between 3 and 30 minutes at {{Cvt|121-134|C|}} at {{Cvt|100|kPa|}}, but adjustments may be made depending on the [[bioburden]] of the article being sterilized, its resistance ([[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]]) to steam sterilization, the article's heat tolerance, and the required sterility assurance level. Following the completion of a cycle, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.

Proper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial [[spore]]s in addition to [[fungi]], bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all [[prion]]s, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state {{Cvt|121–132|C|}} for 60 minutes or {{Cvt|134|C|}} for at least 18 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutala WA, Weber DJ | title = Guideline for disinfection and sterilization of prion-contaminated medical instruments | journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–17 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20055640 | doi = 10.1086/650197 | s2cid = 36473735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 263K [[scrapie]] prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CKD) and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) are more resistant. Using [[laboratory mouse|mice]] as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive [[brain]] tissue at {{Cvt|134–138|C|}} for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 [[logarithm|log]] decrease in prion infectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.tma.uz/gps/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/09/ASEPSIS-ANTISEPTICS-INTRODUCTION.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-24 |archive-date=2016-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024090200/http://web.tma.uz/gps/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/09/ASEPSIS-ANTISEPTICS-INTRODUCTION.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. [[Autoclave tape|Indicator tape]] is often placed on the packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/When_using_autoclave_we_use_autoclave_tape_which_changes_color_to_black_indicating_autoclaving_was_successful_what_is_the_molecular_mechanism|title=When using autoclave we use autoclave tape which changes color to black indicating autoclaving was successful, what is the molecular mechanism?|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biological indicator|Biological indicators]] can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Simple biological indicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'' (formerly ''Bacillus stearothermophilus''), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside [[glassine]] envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.

For autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved through physical scrubbing, [[sonication]], [[Ultrasonic cleaning|ultrasound]], or pulsed air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decontamination and Sterilization|url=http://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/BioSafety/decon/Pages/decontamination.aspx|website=NIH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pressure cooking]] and [[canning]] is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed correctly renders food sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth S, Feichtinger J, Hertel C | title = Characterization of Bacillus subtilis spore inactivation in low-pressure, low-temperature gas plasma sterilization processes | journal = Journal of Applied Microbiology | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 521–31 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19659696 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04453.x | s2cid = 25835705 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=No mention of canning in citation}}

To sterilize waste materials that are chiefly composed of liquid, a purpose-built [[effluent decontamination system]] can be utilized. These devices can function using a variety of sterilants, although using heat via steam is most common.

=== Dry ===
{{See also|Dry heat sterilization}}

[[File:2003-12-03-Heissluft-Sterilisator.JPG|thumb|Dry heat sterilizer]]Dry heat was the first method of sterilization and is a longer process than moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms through the use of dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Casolari A |title=FOOD STERILIZATION BY HEAT|url=http://www.vency.com/sterilization.html|website=Liberty Knowledge Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at {{Cvt|160|C|}}. A rapid method heats air to {{Cvt|190|C|}} for 6 minutes for unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.ab.ca/resources/publications/PersonalServicesPt1.pdf |title=– Alberta Health and Wellness |publisher=Health.gov.ab.ca |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/content/medical/14274/css/14274_146.htm|title=Chemical Vapor Sterilization|website=www.tpub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry heat has the advantage that it can be used on powders and other heat-stable items that are adversely affected by steam (e.g. it does not cause rusting of steel objects).

===Flaming===
Flaming is done to [[inoculation loop]]s and straight-wires in microbiology labs for [[Streaking (microbiology)|streaking]]. Leaving the loop in the flame of a [[Bunsen burner]] or [[alcohol burner]] until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see [[Sterilisation (microbiology)#Incineration|Incineration]] below). However, during the initial heating, infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or more concentrated solution of [[ethanol]], then briefly touch the object to a [[Bunsen burner]] flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame

===Incineration===
[[Incineration]] is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other [[Biomedical waste|biohazardous waste]] before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Incineration]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyndallization===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an obsolete and lengthy process designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.

===Glass bead sterilizers===
Glass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to {{Cvt|250|C|}}. Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in [[dentistry|dental]] offices as well as biological laboratories,&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zadik Y, Peretz A | title = [The effectiveness of glass bead sterilizer in the dental practice] | journal = Refu'at Ha-Peh Veha-Shinayim | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 36–9, 75 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18780544 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are not approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/OralHealth/InfectionControl/faq/bead.htm 2008-09-11&lt;/ref&gt; They are still popular in [[Europe]]an and [[Israel]]i dental practices, although there are no current [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] guidelines for using this sterilizer.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;

==Chemical sterilization==
[[File:2003-12-03-Chemiclav.JPG|thumb|Chemiclav]]

Chemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, [[fiber optic]]s, electronics, and many [[plastic]]s. In these situations chemicals, either in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used and that the sterilant is able to reach all surfaces that must be sterilized (typically cannot penetrate packaging). In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for [[Workplace safety and health|workplace safety]], as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans. The procedure for removing sterilant residue from the sterilized materials varies depending on the chemical and process that is used.

===Ethylene oxide===
[[Ethylene oxide]] (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray), heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total sterilizations, and for over 50% of all [[disposable]] medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanemitsu K, Imasaka T, Ishikawa S, Kunishima H, Harigae H, Ueno K, Takemura H, Hirayama Y, Kaku M | display-authors = 6 | title = A comparative study of ethylene oxide gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and low-temperature steam formaldehyde sterilization | journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 486–9 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15954488 | doi = 10.1086/502572 | s2cid = 19446196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/ethylene-oxide-factsheet.pdf|title=Ethylene oxide |website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=OSHA|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between {{Cvt|30 and 60|C|}} with [[relative humidity]] above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naspco.com/sterilization/|title=Sterilization {{!}} NASP|website=North American Sterilization &amp; Packaging|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all [[porous materials]], and it can penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic, and [[carcinogen]]ic; however, only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological [[validation (drug manufacturer)|validation]] after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.

The traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to remove EO residues and lower by-products such as [[ethylene chlorohydrin]] (EC or ECH) and, of lesser importance, [[ethylene glycol]] (EG). An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.

The most common EO processing method is the gas chamber method. To benefit from [[economies of scale]], EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber with a combination of gaseous EO either as pure EO, or with other gases used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons ([[CFCs]]), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mushtaq M, Banks CJ, Heaven S | title = Effectiveness of pressurised carbon dioxide for inactivation of Escherichia coli isolated from sewage sludge | journal = Water Science and Technology | volume = 65 | issue = 10 | pages = 1759–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22546789 | doi = 10.2166/wst.2012.064 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes GCC, Brandão TRS, Silva CLM. 2007. Ethylene oxide sterilization of medical devices: A review. Am J Infect Control.&lt;/ref&gt; Since EO is explosive at concentrations above 3%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=730&amp;tid=133|title=ATSDR - Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Ethylene Oxide|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; EO was traditionally supplied with an [[Inert gas|inert]] carrier gas, such as a CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the carrier gas was banned because of concerns of [[ozone depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/snap/sterilants/sterilants.pdf |title=Substitute Sterilants under SNAP as of September 28, 2006 |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[halogenated hydrocarbon]]s are being replaced by systems using 100% EO, because of regulations and the high cost of the blends. In hospitals, most EO sterilizers use single-use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of EO blends.

It is important to adhere to patient and healthcare personnel government specified limits of EO residues in and/or on processed products, operator exposure after processing, during storage and handling of EO gas cylinders, and environmental emissions produced when using EO.

The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) at 1 ppm – calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) – and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL). The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]'s (NIOSH) immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for EO is 800 ppm.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=NIOSH: Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH) / NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95) - intridl4 |publisher=Cdc.gov |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Odor Threshold|odor threshold]] is around 500 ppm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg137.html |title=ATSDR - MMG: Ethylene Oxide |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2007-09-24 |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; so EO is imperceptible until concentrations are well above the OSHA PEL. Therefore, OSHA recommends that continuous gas monitoring systems be used to protect workers using EO for processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hospital/central/central.html |title=Hospital eTool: Central Supply Module |publisher=Osha.gov |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen dioxide===
[[Nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas is a rapid and effective sterilant for use against a wide range of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of [[DNA]] in the spore core through [[nitration]] of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This degradations occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;Görsdorf S, Appel KE, Engeholm C, Obe G.; Nitrogen dioxide induces DNA single-strand breaks in cultured Chinese hamster cells: Carcinogenesis. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a boiling point of {{Cvt|21|C|}} at sea level, which results in a relatively highly saturated [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is often referred to by the name of its [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no [[condensation]] occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanism Overview, June 2012|url=http://noxilizer.com/pdf/news/WhitePaper-Mechanism_Overview_6_14_12.pdf|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|access-date=2 July 2013|archive-date=12 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412094958/http://noxilizer.com/pdf/news/WhitePaper-Mechanism_Overview_6_14_12.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also less [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"/&gt;

The most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is the spore of ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'', which is the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of ''G. stearothermophilus'' has been well characterized over the years as a [[biological indicator]] in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of ''G. stearothermophilus'' with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas proceeds rapidly in a [[Log-linear graph|log-linear]] fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for [[medical devices]] at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noxilizer Contract Sterilization Services|url=http://noxilizer.com/services.php|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|access-date=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"/&gt;
Eniware, LLC has developed a portable, power-free sterilizer that uses no electricity, heat or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nextbillion.net/sterilization-part-2/|title=Sterilization Trumps Disposable: Pre-packaged instruments place 'huge burden' on remote facilities - NextBillion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 25 liter unit makes sterilization of surgical instruments possible for austere forward surgical teams, in health centers throughout the world with intermittent or no electricity and in disaster relief and humanitarian crisis situations. The four hour cycle uses a single use gas generation ampoule and a disposable scrubber to remove nitrogen dioxide gas.&lt;ref&gt;Nitrogen Dioxide Sterilization in Low-Resource Environments: A Feasibility Study. PLoS ONE 10(6): e0130043. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0130043&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone===
[[Ozone]] is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to [[oxidize]] most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.

Ozone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties ([[Oxidation number|E]]=2.076 vs [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics | edition = 76th |year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;) capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical-grade [[oxygen]]. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple [[Catalysis|catalyst]] that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH's immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ozone is {{nowrap|5 ppm,}} {{nowrap|160 times}} smaller than the {{nowrap|800 ppm}} IDLH for ethylene oxide. NIOSH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html|title=CDC - Index of Chemicals - NIOSH Publications and Products |website=www.cdc.gov |date=2019-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at {{nowrap|0.1 ppm}}, calculated as an {{nowrap|eight-hour}} time-weighted average. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.

===Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde===

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}

[[Glutaraldehyde]] and [[formaldehyde]] solutions (also used as [[fixation (histology)|fixatives]]) are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]], and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf-life (&lt;2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf-life if some [[methanol]] is added to inhibit [[polymerization]] to [[paraformaldehyde]], but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original [[Salk Polio Vaccine|Salk polio vaccine]], are sterilized with formaldehyde.

===Hydrogen peroxide===
[[Hydrogen peroxide]], in both liquid and as [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong [[oxidant]], which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid [[endoscope]]s. In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aspjj.com/emea/products-and-services/low-temperature-sterilization/sterrad-nx|title= Sterrad NX|access-date= 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing [[nylon]] may become brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/Disinfection_Nov_2008.pdf|title= Guidelines for Disinfection|date= 2008|publisher= [[Centers for Disease Control]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The penetrating ability of hydrogen peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide{{citation needed|date= January 2013}} and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause [[Skin whitening|bleaching]] or [[ulceration]] depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (&gt; 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the IDLH at 75 ppm,&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9992|title= 29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1|access-date= 25 March 2015|publisher= [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilizer manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers documented in the FDA MAUDE database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM |title=MAUDE - Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices should include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/hydrogenperoxide/recognition.html |title=Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Osha.gov |access-date=2010-06-25 |archive-date=2011-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612114616/http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/hydrogenperoxide/recognition.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg174.html |title=ATSDR - MMG: Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2007-09-24 |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP) is used to sterilize large enclosed and sealed areas, such as entire rooms and aircraft interiors.

Although toxic, VHP breaks down in a short time to water and oxygen.

===Peracetic acid===
[[Peracetic acid]] (0.2%) is a recognized sterilant by the FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/ReprocessingofReusableMedicalDevices/ucm437347.htm |title= Cleared Sterilants and High Level Disinfectants with General Claims for Processing Reusable Medical and Dental Devices |date= March 2015 |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in sterilizing medical devices such as [[endoscope]]s. Peracetic acid which is also known as peroxyacetic acid is a chemical compound often used in disinfectants such as sanitizers. It is most commonly produced by the reaction of [[acetic acid]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]] with each other by using an acid catalyst. Peracetic acid is never sold in unstabilized solutions which is why it is considered to be environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Peracetic Acid Uses and Hazards |url=https://synergist.aiha.org/201612-peracetic-acid-uses-and-hazards |access-date=2020-12-11 |website=The Synergist |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peracetic acid is a colorless liquid and the molecular formula of peracetic acid is C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CH3COOOH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=PubChem |title=Peracetic acid |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6585 |access-date=2020-12-11 |website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, peracetic acid is being used throughout the world as more people are using fumigation to decontaminate surfaces to reduce the risk of Covid-19 and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2020-12-08 |title=Peracetic acid fumigation as powerful and cost-effective disinfectant of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces |url=https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201208/Peracetic-acid-fumigation-as-powerful-and-cost-effective-disinfectant-of-SARS-CoV-2-on-surfaces.aspx |access-date=2020-12-12 |website=News-Medical.net |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential for chemical sterilization of prions===
Prions are highly resistant to chemical sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonnell G, Burke P | title = The challenge of prion decontamination | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 9 | pages = 1152–4 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12715310 | doi = 10.1086/374668 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment with [[aldehyde]]s, such as formaldehyde, have actually been shown to increase prion resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) for one hour was shown to be ineffective, providing less than 3 logs (10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction in contamination. [[Iodine]], formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and peracetic acid also fail this test (one hour treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogez-Kreuz C, Yousfi R, Soufflet C, Quadrio I, Yan ZX, Huyot V, Aubenque C, Destrez P, Roth K, Roberts C, Favero M, Clayette P | display-authors = 6 | title = Inactivation of animal and human prions by hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization | journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 769–77 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19563265 | doi = 10.1086/598342 | s2cid = 26848322 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/40df22a955850ed46a9dd8e24d89cd195fa4e083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[chlorine]], [[phenols|phenolic compounds]], [[guanidinium thiocyanate]], and sodium hydroxide reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and sodium hydroxide are the most consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref name="Prion NaOH"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bauman PA, Lawrence LA, Biesert L, Dichtelmüller H, Fabbrizzi F, Gajardo R, Gröner A, Jorquera JI, Kempf C, Kreil TR, von Hoegen I, Pifat DY, Petteway SR, Cai K | display-authors = 6 | title = Critical factors influencing prion inactivation by sodium hydroxide | journal = Vox Sanguinis | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–40 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16756599 | doi = 10.1111/j.1423-0410.2006.00790.x | s2cid = 1267167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation sterilization==
Sterilization can be achieved using [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[ultraviolet]] [[light]], [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]], or irradiation by [[subatomic particle]]s such as by [[electron beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/iachem/publications.html Trends in Radiation Sterilization of Health Care Products], IAEA, Vienna,24 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Electromagnetic or particulate radiation can be energetic enough to ionize atoms or molecules ([[ionizing radiation]]), or less energetic ([[non-ionizing radiation]]).

===Non-ionizing radiation sterilization===
{{Further|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}
Ultraviolet light irradiation (UV, from a [[germicidal lamp]]) is useful for sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to [[visible light]] absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of [[biological safety cabinet]]s between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to remove).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Eischeid AC, Linden KG |title = Molecular indications of protein damage in adenoviruses after UV disinfection |journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume = 77 |issue = 3 |pages = 1145–7 |date = February 2011 | pmid = 21131511 |pmc = 3028702 |doi = 10.1128/aem.00403-10 |bibcode = 2011ApEnM..77.1145E }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also damages some plastics, such as [[polystyrene]] foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.

===Ionizing radiation sterilization===
[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|thumb|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]

The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] of the [[United Nations]] and monitored by the different national [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]s (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.

[[Gamma Radiation|Gamma radiation]] is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, [[cannula]]s and IV sets, and food. It is emitted by a [[radioisotope]], usually [[cobalt-60]] (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co) or [[caesium-137]] (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs), which have [[photon]] energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 [[MeV]], respectively.

Use of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated in the water in hermetically-sealed bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in [[Decatur, Georgia]], US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html |title=NRC: Information Notice No. 89-82: Recent Safety-Related Incidents at Large Irradiators |website=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma [[photon]]s have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.

[[Electron beam processing]] is also commonly used for sterilization. [[Cathode ray|Electron beams]] use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because [[electron]]s carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2019/conf/fermilab-conf-19-574-di.pdf |title= 2019 Midwest Medical Device Sterilization Workshop: Summary Report 
|date= November 2019 |publisher= United States [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High-energy X-rays]] (produced by ''[[bremsstrahlung]]'') allow irradiation of large packages and [[pallet]] loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an [[X-ray generator]] that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as [[tantalum]] or [[tungsten]] with high-energy electrons, in a process known as ''bremsstrahlung'' conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.

[[Irradiation]] with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials [[radioactive]], because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to [[induced radioactivity|induce radioactivity]] in a material.&lt;ref name="ThomadsenNath2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Thomadsen B, Nath R, Bateman FB, Farr J, Glisson C, Islam MK, LaFrance T, Moore ME, George Xu X, Yudelev M |display-authors = 6 |title = Potential hazard due to induced radioactivity secondary to radiotherapy: the report of task group 136 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine |journal = Health Physics |volume = 107 |issue = 5 |pages = 442–60 |date = November 2014 |pmid = 25271934 |doi = 10.1097/HP.0000000000000139 |s2cid = 26289104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neutron]]s and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.

Sterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Bharati S, Soundrapandian C, Basu D, Datta S |title= Studies on a novel bioactive glass and composite coating with hydroxyapatite on titanium based alloys: Effect of γ-sterilization on coating |journal= [[J.

Irradiation is used by the [[United States Postal Service]] to sterilize mail in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Some foods (e.g. spices and ground meats) are [[food irradiation|sterilized by irradiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:wZcjSTjqaYkJ:scholar.google.com/+food+sterilization+by+irradiation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,33&amp;as_vis=1 |title=Employing Ionizing Radiation to Enhance Food Safety – a Review The Purpose of Food Irradiation In recent decades, food irradia |website=scholar.googleusercontent.com |access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subatomic particles may be more or less penetrating and may be generated by a radioisotope or a device, depending upon the type of particle.

==Sterile filtration==
Fluids that would be damaged by heat, irradiation or chemical sterilization, such as drug solution, can be sterilized by [[microfiltration]] using [[membrane filter]]s. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and [[protein]] solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size of usually 0.22 [[micrometre|µm]] will effectively remove [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="DeptHealth"&gt;
{{cite journal | title = Guidance for Industry, Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing — Current Good Manufacturing Practice | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | year = 2004 | url = https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070342.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[staphylococcus|staphylococcal]] species have, however, been shown to be flexible enough to pass through 0.22&amp;nbsp;µm filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Onyango LA, Dunstan RH, Roberts TK | title = Filterability of staphylococcal species through membrane filters following application of stressors | journal = BMC Research Notes | volume = 3 | pages = 152 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20509961 | pmc = 2896367 | doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-3-152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the processing of [[biologic medical product|biologics]], [[virus]]es must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of [[nanofiltration|nanofilters]] with a smaller pore size (20–50 [[nanometre|nm]]). Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. [[Cross-flow filtration|Tangential flow filtration]] (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.

Membrane filters used in production processes are commonly made from materials such as mixed [[cellulose ester]] or [[polyethersulfone]] (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a [[cleanroom]] to prevent contamination.

==Preservation of sterility==
[[File:Curette in sterile packaging.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[curette]] in sterile packaging.]]
Instruments that have undergone sterilization can be maintained in such condition by containment in sealed packaging until use.

Aseptic technique is the act of maintaining sterility during procedures.

A '''storage organ''' is a part of a plant specifically modified for storage of energy 
(generally in the form of [[carbohydrate]]s) or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/storage-organ|title=the definition of storage organ|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage organs often grow underground, where they are better protected from attack by [[herbivore]]s. Plants that have an underground storage organ are called '''geophytes''' in the [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Raunkiær plant life-form classification system]].&lt;ref&gt;The underground storage organ itself is sometimes called a geophyte, but this is not the original usage of the term in the [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Raunkiær plant life-form classification]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Raunkiaer_1934&gt;{{Citation |last=Raunkiær |first=Christen |year=1934 |title=The life forms of plants and statistical plant geography |publication-place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |oclc=4300750 |others=trans. Gilbert-Carter, H.; Fausbøll, A. &amp; Tansley, A.G. }}; reprinted (1977) in ''History of ecology'' series, New York: Arno Press, {{ISBN|978-0-405-10418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage organs often, but not always, act as [[perennating organ]]s which enable plants to survive adverse conditions (such as cold, excessive heat, lack of light or drought).

== Relationship to perennating organ ==
Storage organs may act as [[perennating organ]]s ('perennating' as in [[Perennial plant|perennial]], meaning "through the year", used in the sense of continuing beyond the year and in due course lasting for multiple years). These are used by plants to survive adverse periods in the plant's life-cycle (e.g. caused by cold, excessive heat, lack of light or drought). During these periods, parts of the plant die and then when conditions become favourable again, re-growth occurs from [[buds]] in the perennating organs. For example, geophytes growing in woodland under deciduous trees (e.g. [[Hyacinthoides non-scripta|bluebells]], [[trilliums]]) die back to underground storage organs during summer when tree leaf cover restricts light and water is less available.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

However, perennating organs need not be storage organs. After losing their leaves, deciduous trees grow them again from 'resting buds', which are the perennating organs of phanerophytes in the [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Raunkiær classification]], but which do not specifically act as storage organs. Equally, storage organs need not be perennating organs. Many [[succulent plant|succulents]] have leaves adapted for water storage, which they retain in adverse conditions.

==Underground storage organ==

In common parlance, underground storage organs may be generically called roots, [[tuber]]s, or bulbs, but to the [[botanist]] there is more specific technical [[nomenclature]]:
[[Image:Gingembre.jpg|thumb|right|A harvested [[ginger]] rhizome]]
* True [[root]]s:
** Storage [[taproot]] — e.g. carrot
** [[Tuberous root]] or root tuber – e.g. ''[[Dahlia]]''&lt;ref&gt;Examples mainly taken from {{Citation |last=Rix |first=M. |year=1983 |title=Growing bulbs |publication-place=Beckenham, Kent |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-7099-2248-3 }}, pp. 5-12&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modified [[plant stem|stem]]s:
** [[Bulb]] (a short stem that produces fleshy scale leaves or modified leaf bases) — e.g. ''[[Lilium]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', onion
** [[Caudex]] — e.g. ''[[Adenium]]'' (desert-rose)
** [[Corm]] — e.g. ''[[Crocus]]''
** [[Pseudobulb]] — e.g. ''[[Pleione (plant)|Pleione]]'' (windowsill orchid)
** [[Rhizome]] — e.g. ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'' (yellow flag iris)
** [[Stem tuber]] — e.g. ''[[Zantedeschia]]'' (arum lily), potato
** Trophopod (the persistent [[Petiole (botany)|petiole base]] of several fern genera)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=David M. |title=Trophopods in North American Species of Athyrium (Aspleniaceae) |journal=Systematic Botany |date=January–March 1986 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=26–31 |doi=10.2307/2418941 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2418941 |access-date=31 March 2022 |publisher=American Society of Plant Taxonomists}}&lt;/ref&gt; — e.g. ''[[Diplazium]]'', ''[[Onoclea sensibilis#Description|Onoclea sensibilis]]''
* Others:
** Storage [[hypocotyl]] (the stem of a seedling) — sometimes called a [[tuber]], as in ''[[Cyclamen]]''

Some of the above, particularly pseudobulbs and caudices, may occur wholly or partially above ground. Intermediates and combinations of the above are also found, making classification difficult. As an example of an intermediate, the tuber of ''Cyclamen'' arises from the stem of the seedling, which forms the junction of the roots and stem of the mature plant. In some species (e.g. ''[[Cyclamen coum]]'') roots come from the bottom of the tuber, suggesting that it is a stem tuber; in others (e.g. ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'') roots come largely from the top of the tuber, suggesting that it is a root tuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Grey-Wilson |first=C. |year=1988 |title=The Genus Cyclamen |publication-place=Bromley, UK |publisher=[[Christopher Helm]] |isbn=978-0-7470-1221-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of a combination, juno irises have both bulbs and storage roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Köhlein |first=Fritz |year=1987 |title=Iris |publication-place=London |publisher=Christopher Helm |isbn=978-0-7470-1803-2 |others=translated by M.C. Peters from German original published in 1981  }}, pp. 257ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underground storage organs used for food may be generically called [[root vegetable]]s, although this phrase should not be taken to imply that the class only includes true roots.

== Other storage organs ==
[[File:Cookie Tree Jade.JPG|thumb|''[[Crassula arborescens]]'', a leaf succulent]]

[[Succulent]]s are plants which are adapted to withstand periods of drought by their ability to store moisture in specialized storage organs.&lt;ref&gt;Information in this section taken from {{Citation |last=Innes |first=Clive |last2=Wall |first2=Bill |year=1995 |title=Cacti, Succulents and Bromeliads |publication-place=London |publisher=Cassell Educational (for Royal Horticultural Society) |isbn=978-0-304-32076-9 |name-list-style=amp }}, pp. 75–6&lt;/ref&gt;

* Leaf succulents store water in their leaves, which are thus thickened, fleshy and typically covered with a waxy coating or fine hairs to reduce evaporation. They may also contain mucilaginous compounds. Some leaf succulents have leaves which are distributed along the stem in a similar fashion to non-succulent species (e.g. ''[[Crassula]]'', ''[[Kalanchoe]]''); their stems may also be succulent. In others, the leaves are more compact, forming a rosette (e.g. ''[[Echeveria]]'', ''[[Aloe]]''). Pebble-plants or living stones (e.g. ''[[Lithops]]'', ''[[Conophytum]]'') have reduced their leaves to just two, forming a fleshy body, only the top of which may be visible above ground.

[[File:Ferocactus pilosus1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Ferocactus|Ferocactus pilosus]]'' (Mexican lime cactus), a stem succulent]]
* [[Stem succulent]]s are generally either leafless or have leaves which can be quickly shed in the event of drought. Photosynthesis is then taken over by the stems. As with leaf succulents, stems may be covered with a waxy coating or fine hairs to reduce evaporation. The ribbed bodies of [[cacti]] may be an adaption to allow shrinkage and expansion with the amount of water stored. Plants of the same general form as cacti are found in other families (e.g. ''[[Euphorbia canariensis]]'' (family [[Euphorbiaceae]]), ''[[Stapelia]]'' (family [[Apocynaceae]])).

==Membership==
The SAGE has 15 members, who are recruited and selected as acknowledged experts from around the world in the fields of [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], [[vaccinology]], [[paediatrics]], [[internal medicine]], [[infectious diseases]], [[immunology]], [[drug regulation]], programme management, immunization delivery, health-care administration, health economics, and vaccine safety.&lt;ref name="sagem"&gt;{{cite web |title=SAGE members |url=https://www.who.int/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization/members |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=29 August 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are appointed by Director-General of the WHO to serve an initial term of 3 years, and can only be renewed once.&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt;

==Working groups==
SAGE meets at least twice annually in April and November, with working groups established for detailed review of specific topics prior to discussion by the full group. Priorities of work and meeting agendas are developed by the Group in consultation with WHO.&lt;ref name="wmsage"&gt;{{cite web |title=SAGE working mechanisms and working groups |url=https://www.who.int/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization/working-groups |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=21 August 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNICEF]], the Secretariat of the [[GAVI Alliance]], and WHO Regional Offices participate as observers in SAGE meetings and deliberations. WHO also invites other observers to SAGE meetings, including representatives from WHO regional technical advisory groups, non-governmental organizations, international professional organizations, technical agencies, donor organizations and associations of manufacturers of vaccines and immunization technologies. Additional experts may be invited, as appropriate, to further contribute to specific agenda items.&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wmsage/&gt;

The Strep-tag system is a method which allows the purification and detection of [[protein]]s by [[affinity chromatography]]. The '''Strep-tag''' II is a synthetic [[peptide]] consisting of eight [[amino acids]] ([[Tryptophan|Trp]]-[[Serine|Ser]]-[[Histidine|His]]-[[Proline|Pro]]-[[Gln]]-[[Phenylalanine|Phe]]-[[Glutamic acid|Glu]]-[[Lysine|Lys]]). This peptide sequence exhibits intrinsic affinity towards Strep-Tactin, a specifically engineered [[streptavidin]], and can be N- or C- terminally fused to recombinant proteins. By exploiting the highly specific interaction, ''Strep''-tagged proteins can be isolated in one step from crude cell lysates. Because the ''Strep''-tag elutes under gentle, physiological conditions, it is especially suited for generation of functional proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1528–35 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.209 |title=The Strep-tag system for one-step purification and high-affinity detection or capturing of proteins |year=2007 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Thomas GM |last2=Skerra |first2=Arne |journal=Nature Protocols |volume=2 |issue=6 |pmid=17571060|s2cid=25209313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pmid=11036648 |year=2000 |last1=Skerra |first1=A |last2=Schmidt |first2=TG |title=Use of the Strep-Tag and streptavidin for detection and purification of recombinant proteins |volume=326 |pages=271–304 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(00)26060-6 |series=Methods in Enzymology |isbn=978-0-12-182227-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Development and biochemistry of the Strep-tag  ==

[[Streptavidin]] is a tetrameric protein expressed in ''[[Streptomyces avidinii]]''. Because of Streptavidin's high affinity for vitamin H ([[biotin]]), Streptavidin is commonly used in the fields of [[molecular biology]] and [[biotechnology]]. The Strep-tag was originally selected from a genetic library to specifically bind to a proteolytically truncated "core" version of streptavidin. Over the years, the Strep-tag was systemically optimized, to permit a greater flexibility in the choice of attachment site. Further, its interaction partner, Streptavidin, was also optimized to increase peptide-binding capacity, which resulted in the development of Strep-Tactin.  The binding affinity of Strep-tag to Strep-Tactin is nearly 100 times higher than from Strep-tag to Streptavidin. The so-called Strep-tag system, consisting of Strep-tag and Strep-Tactin, has proven particularly useful for the functional isolation and analysis of  protein complexes in [[proteomics|proteome]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=10547–53 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.20.10547 |title=Structure at 2.7 Å resolution of the ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' two-subunit cytochrome c oxidase complexed with an antibody F&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; fragment |year=1997 |last1=Ostermeier |first1=Christian |last2=Harrenga |first2=Axel |last3=Ermler |first3=Ulrich |last4=Michel |first4=Hartmut |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=94 |issue=20 |pmid=9380672 |pmc=23397|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  The Strep-tag principle  ==

Just like other short-affinity tags ([[His-tag]], [[FLAG-tag]]), the Strep-tag can be easily fused to [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] proteins during subcloning of its [[cDNA]] or [[gene]]. For its expression, various vectors for various host organisms (''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[yeast]], [[insect]], and [[mammalian]] cells) are available.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.qiagen.com/resources/download.aspx?id=0fadc040-86ad-4e31-bb58-7e83ceb77b72&amp;lang=en {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular benefit of the Strep-tag is its rather small size and the fact that it is biochemically almost [[Chemically inert|inert]]. Therefore, protein folding or secretion is not influenced and usually it does not interfere with protein function. Strep-tag is especially suited for analysis of functional proteins, because the purification procedure can be kept under physiological conditions. This not only allows the isolation of sensitive proteins in a native state, but it is also possible to purify intact protein complexes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1199–203 |doi=10.1002/pmic.200400991 |title=Single-step Strep-tag purification for the isolation and identification of protein complexes from mammalian cells |year=2005 |last1=Junttila |first1=Melissa R. |last2=Saarinen |first2=Susanna |last3=Schmidt |first3=Thomas |last4=Kast |first4=Juergen |last5=Westermarck |first5=Jukka |journal=Proteomics |volume=5 |issue=5 |pmid=15761952|s2cid=24773674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even if just one subunit carries the tag.

In the first step of the Strep-tag purification cycle, the [[cell lysate]] containing Strep-tag fusion protein is applied to a column with immobilized Strep-Tactin (step 1). After the tagged protein has specifically bound to Strep-Tactin, a short washing step with a physiological [[Buffer solution|buffer]] (e.g. phosphate buffered saline, PBS) removes all other host proteins (step 2). This is due to Strep-Tactin's low tendency to bind proteins non specifically. Then, the purified Strep-tag fusion protein is gently eluted with a low concentration of [[desthiobiotin]], which specifically competes for the biotin binding pocket (step 3). To regenerate the column, desthiobiotin is removed by application of a HABA containing solution (a yellow [[azo dye]]). The removal of desthiobiotin is indicated by a color change from yellow-orange to red (step 4+5).
Finally, the HABA solution is washed out with a small volume of running buffer, thus making the column ready to use for the next purification run.

== Strep-tag applications ==

The Strep-tag system offers a selective tool to purify proteins under physiological conditions. The proteins obtained are bioactive and display a very high purity (above 95%). Also, the Strep-tag system can be used for protein detection in various assays. Depending on the experimental circumstances, Strep-tag antibodies ''or'' Strep-Tactin, with an enzymatic (e.g.[[horseradish peroxidase]] (HRP), [[alkaline phosphatase]] (AP)) or fluorescence (e.g. [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP)) marker. If high purity is required, the lysate can be purified by first using Strep-Tactin and then perform a second run using antibodies against Strep-tag. This reduces the contamination with unspecific bound proteins, which might occur in some rare scenarios.

Following assays can be conducted using the Strep-tag detection system:
* one-step affinity purification
* Protein:protein interaction studies
* [[Colony blot]], [[dot blot]], [[Western blot]] and [[ELISA]]
* Screening for positive [[expression clones]]
* [[Immunocytochemistry]] and [[Immunohistochemistry]]
* Protein localization and targeting studies
Because the Strep-tag is capable of isolating protein complexes, strategies for the study of protein-protein interactions can also be conducted. Another option is the immobilization of Strep-tag proteins with a specific high affinity antibody on microplates or biochips.

Strep-Tag/StrepTactin system is also used in [[Single-molecule experiment|single-molecule]] [[optical tweezers]] and [[atomic force microscope]] experiments, showing high mechanical stability comparable to the strongest non-covalent linkages currently available.&lt;ref&gt;Moayed F, Mashaghi A, Tans SJ (2013) A Polypeptide-DNA Hybrid with Selective Linking Capability Applied to Single Molecule Nano-Mechanical Measurements Using Optical Tweezers.

The '''Streptamer''' technology allows the reversible isolation and staining of antigen-specific [[T cells]]. This technology combines a current T cell isolation method with the [[Strep-tag]] technology. In principle, the T cells are separated by establishing a specific interaction between the T cell of interest and a molecule that is conjugated to a marker, which enables the isolation. The reversibility of this interaction and the low temperatures at which it is performed allows for the isolation and characterization of functional T cells.
Because T cells remain phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from untreated cells, this method offers modern strategies in clinical and basic T cell research.&lt;ref&gt;Knabel, M., Franz, T.J., Schiemann, M., Wulf, A., Villmow, B., Schmidt., B., Bernhard, H., Wagner, H. and Busch, D. (2002) Reversible MHC multimer staining for functional isolation of T-cell populations and effective adoptive transfer. Nature Medicine 8 (6), 631-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classic methods in T cell research==
T cells play an important role in the adaptive [[immune system]]. They are capable of orchestrating, regulating and coordinating complex immune responses. A wide array of clinically relevant aspects are associated with the function or malfunction of T-cells: [[Autoimmune diseases]], control of [[virus|viral]] or [[bacterial]] [[pathogens]], development of [[cancer]] or [[Medical grafting|graft]] versus host responses.
Over the past years, various methods ([[ELISpot Assay]], [[intracellular cytokine staining]], [[secretion assay]]) have been developed for the identification of T cells, but only [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) procedures allow identification and purification of antigen-specific T cells independent of their functional status.

In principle, MHC procedures are using the [[T cell receptor]] (TCR) ligand, which is the MHC-peptide complex, as a staining probe. The MHC interacts with the TCR, which in turn is expressed on the T cells. Because TCR-MHC interactions have only a very weak [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] towards each other, monomeric MHC-epitope complexes cannot provide stable binding. This problem can be solved by using multimerized MHC-epitopes, which increases the binding [[avidity]] and therefore allows stable binding. [[Fluorochromes]] conjugated to the MHC-multimers then can be used for identification of T cells by [[flow cytometry]].
Nowadays, MHC molecules can be produced recombinantly together with the antigenic peptides which are known for a fast-growing number of diseases.

==The Streptamer technology==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Streptamer.jpg|thumb|370px|right|The Strep-tag T-cell staining and isolation using fluorescent Streptamers]] --&gt;

===The Streptamer backbone===
The Streptamer staining principle combines the classic method of T cell isolation by MHC-multimers with the [[Strep-tag]]/[[Strep-Tactin]] technology. The ''Strep''-tag is a short peptide sequence that displays moderate binding [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[biotin]]-binding site of a mutated streptavidin molecule, called Strep-Tactin. For the Streptamer technology, the Strep-Tactin molecules are multimerized and form the "backbone", thus creating a platform for binding to strep-tagged proteins. Additionally, the Strep-Tactin backbone has a fluorescent label to allow flow cytometry analysis. Incubation of MHC-Strep-tag fusion proteins with the Strep-Tactin backbone results in the formation of a MHC-multimer, which is capable for antigen-specific staining of T cells.

===Reversible staining===
Because the molecule d-biotin has a much higher affinity to Strep-Tactin than Strep-tag, it can effectively compete for the binding site.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt TGM and Skerra A, 2007. The Strep-tag system for one-step purification and high-affinity detection or capturing of proteins. NATURE PROTOCOLS 2, 1528-1535.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strep-tag.com/ |title=Home |website=strep-tag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a MHC multimer based on the interaction of Strep-tag with Strep-Tactin is easily disrupted in the presence of relatively low concentrations of d-biotin. Without the Strep-Tactin backbone, the single MHC-Strep-tag fusion proteins spontaneously detach from the TCR of the T cell, because of weak binding affinities 
(monomeric MHC-epitope complexes cannot provide stable binding, see above).

'''Stretch receptors''' are [[mechanoreceptors]] responsive to distention of various organs and muscles, and are neurologically linked to the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] in the brain stem via [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent nerve fibers]].  Examples include stretch receptors in the arm and leg muscles and tendons, in the heart, in the colon wall, and in the lungs.

Stretch receptors are also found around the carotid artery, where they monitor blood pressure and stimulate the release of antidiuretic hormone ([[vasopressin|ADH]]) from the posterior pituitary gland.

Types include:
* [[Golgi organ]]
* [[Muscle spindle]], sensory receptors within the belly of a muscle, which primarily detect changes in the length of this muscle
* [[Pulmonary stretch receptors]], mechanoreceptors found in the lungs
* [[Chordotonal organ]], in insects

'''Autologous CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral vector that encodes for the human ADA cDNA sequence''', sold under the brand name '''Strimvelis''', is a [[medication]] used to treat severe [[Combined immunodeficiencies|combined immunodeficiency]] due to [[adenosine deaminase deficiency]] (ADA-SCID).&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR" /&gt;

The most common side effect is pyrexia (fever).&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR"&gt;{{cite web | title=Strimvelis EPAR | website=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) | url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/strimvelis | access-date=11 June 2020}} Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged.&lt;/ref&gt;

ADA-SCID is a rare inherited condition in which there is a change (mutation) in the gene needed to make an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA).&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR" /&gt; As a result, people lack the ADA enzyme.&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR" /&gt; Because ADA is essential for maintaining healthy lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight off infections), the immune system of people with ADA-SCID does not work properly and without effective treatment they rarely survive more than two years.&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR" /&gt;

Strimvelis is the first ''ex vivo'' autologous gene therapy approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pipeline | website=Orchard Therapeutics | date=2 July 2021 | url=https://www.orchard-tx.com/approach/pipeline/ | access-date=5 July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses ==
Strimvelis is indicated for the treatment of people with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID), for whom no suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related stem cell donor is available.&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR" /&gt;

==Treatment==
The treatment is personalized for each person; [[hematopoietic stem cell]] (HSCs) are extracted from the person and purified so that only [[CD34]]-expressing cells remain. Those cells are [[cell culture|cultured]] with [[cytokines]] and [[growth factors]] and then transduced with a [[gammaretrovirus]] containing the human [[adenosine deaminase]] gene and then reinfused into the person. These cells take root in the person's [[bone marrow]], replicating and creating cells that mature and create normally functioning adenosine deaminase protein, resolving the problem.&lt;ref name="EMA1"&gt;{{cite web | work = [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) | url = https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/strimvelis-epar-product-information_en.pdf | title = Strimvelis | access-date = 13 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Candotti"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Candotti F | s2cid = 8356487 | title = Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells as treatment for primary immunodeficiency diseases | journal = International Journal of Hematology | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | pages = 383–92 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24488786 | doi = 10.1007/s12185-014-1524-z | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Touzot2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touzot F, Hacein-Bey-Abina S, Fischer A, Cavazzana M | s2cid = 207483238 | title = Gene therapy for inherited immunodeficiency | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 789–98 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24823313 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.2014.895811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2016, the transduced cells had a shelf life of about six hours.&lt;ref name="Fierce2016-04" /&gt;

Prior to extraction, the person is treated with [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] in order to increase the number of stem cells and improve the harvest; after that but prior to reinfusion, the person is treated with [[busulfan]] or [[melphalan]] to kill as many of the person's existing HSCs to increase the chances of the new cells' survival.&lt;ref name="Candotti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Touzot2014" /&gt;

== Side effects ==
The most common side effect is pyrexia (fever).&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR" /&gt;

Serious side effects may include effects linked to autoimmunity (when the immune system attacks the body's own cells) such as [[hemolytic anemia]] (low red blood cell counts due to their too rapid breakdown), [[aplastic anemia]] (low blood cell counts due to damaged bone marrow), [[hepatitis]] (liver inflammation), [[thrombocytopenia]] (low blood platelet count) and [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]] (damage to nerves that can result in pain, numbness, muscle weakness and difficulty walking).&lt;ref name="Strimvelis EPAR" /&gt;

Leukemia is a risk of treatment with Strimvelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Orchard Statement on Strimvelis, a Gammaretroviral Vector-Based Gene Therapy for ADA-SCID | website=Orchard Therapeutics | date=30 October 2020 | url=https://ir.orchard-tx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/orchard-statement-strimvelisr-gammaretroviral-vector-based-gene | access-date=5 July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
The treatment was developed at San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy and developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) through a 2010 collaboration with Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele. GSK, working with the biotechnology company [[MolMed]] S.p.A., developed a manufacturing process that was previously only suitable for [[clinical trials]] into one demonstrated to be robust and suitable for commercial supply.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In April 2016, a committee at the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) recommended marketing approval for its use in children with [[adenosine deaminase deficiency]], for whom no matched HSC donor is available, on the basis of a clinical trial that produced a 100% survival rate; the median follow-up time was 7 years after the treatment was administered.&lt;ref name="EMA1" /&gt; 75% of people who received the treatment needed no further [[enzyme replacement therapy]].&lt;ref name="pmid26993219"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Booth C, Gaspar HB, Thrasher AJ | title = Treating Immunodeficiency through HSC Gene Therapy | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 317–327 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26993219 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2016.02.002 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts had begun 14 years before.

As of 2016, the only site approved to manufacture the treatment was MolMed.&lt;ref name="Fierce2016-04"&gt;Ben Adams for FierceBiotech Apr 4, 2016 [http://www.fiercebiotech.com/financials/strimvelis-to-be-start-of-a-whole-new-gene-therapy-platform-for-gsk-and-partners Strimvelis to be the start of a whole new gene therapy platform for GSK and partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, GSK announced it was looking to sell off Strimvelis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GSK gives up on rare diseases as gene therapy gets two customers |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-results-rare-diseases-idUSKBN1AB2EE |work=Reuters |date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2018, GSK sold Strimvelis to Orchard Therapeutics Ltd.; as of that time there had been only five sales of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Paton |first1=James | name-list-style = vanc |title=Tiny U.K. Biotech Takes On Glaxo's $730,000 Gene Therapy |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-06/tiny-biotech-takes-on-goliath-glaxo-s-730-000-gene-therapy |work=Bloomberg |date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

=== Economics ===
The price for the treatment was set at {{euro|594,000}}, twice the annual cost of [[enzyme replacement therapy]] injections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grouph.com/does-the-eu-price-of-strimvelis-create-a-new-glass-ceiling/|title=Does the EU price of Strimvelis create a new 'glass ceiling'? - groupH - Comment =|date=November 2016|website=www.grouph.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enzyme replacement therapy]] for ADA requires weekly injections and costs about {{US$|4.25 million}} for one patient over ten years.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;

=== Names ===
''Strimvelis'' is the brand name.&lt;ref name="EMA1" /&gt; The common name is ''autologous CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral vector that encodes for the human ADA cDNA sequence''.&lt;ref name="EMA1" /&gt;

[[File:Transformation of Argyropelecus olfersi into Sternoptyx diaphana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|In his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Thompson]] illustrates the [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]] of [[Argyropelecus|one fish's]] body form into [[Sternoptyx|another]] with a 20° [[shear mapping]]. He does not discuss the [[evolution]]ary causes of such a structural change, and has accordingly been suspected of [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;]]

'''Biological''' or '''process structuralism''' is a school of biological thought that objects to an exclusively [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] or [[adaptationism|adaptationist]] explanation of [[natural selection]] such as is described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|20th century's modern synthesis]]. It proposes instead that [[Alternatives to Darwinism|evolution is guided differently]], basically by more or less physical forces which shape the development of an animal's body, and sometimes implies that these forces supersede selection altogether.

Structuralists have proposed different mechanisms that might have guided the formation of [[body plan]]s. Before Darwin, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued that animals shared  [[homology (biology)|homologous parts]], and that if one was enlarged, the others would be reduced in compensation. After Darwin, [[D'Arcy Thompson]] hinted at [[vitalism]] and offered geometric explanations in his classic 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. [[Adolf Seilacher]] suggested mechanical inflation for "pneu" structures in [[Ediacaran biota]] fossils such as ''[[Dickinsonia]]''. [[Günter P. Wagner]] argued for developmental bias, structural constraints on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. [[Stuart Kauffman]] favoured [[self-organisation]], the idea that complex structure emerges [[holism|holistically]] and spontaneously from the dynamic interaction of all parts of an [[organism]]. [[Michael Denton]] argued for laws of form by which [[Universals|Platonic universals]] or "Types" are self-organised. [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] proposed [[spandrel (biology)|biological "spandrels"]], features created as a byproduct of the adaptation of nearby structures. [[Gerd B. Müller]] and Stuart A. Newman argued that the appearance in the [[fossil record]] of most of the current [[phylum|phyla]] in the [[Cambrian explosion]] was "pre-Mendelian"{{efn|[[Gregor Mendel]] pioneered the study of [[genetics]].}} evolution caused by physical factors. [[Brian Goodwin]], described by Wagner as part of "a [[pseudoscience|fringe]] movement in evolutionary biology",&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt; denies that biological complexity can be [[reductionism|reduced]] to natural selection, and argues that [[pattern formation]] is driven by [[morphogenetic field]]s.

Darwinian biologists have criticised structuralism, emphasising that there is plentiful evidence both that natural selection is effective and, from [[deep homology]], that [[gene]]s have been involved in shaping organisms throughout [[evolutionary history]]. They accept that some structures such as the [[cell membrane]] self-assemble, but deny the ability of self-organisation to drive large-scale evolution.

==History==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Multiple [[alternatives to Darwinism]] have been offered since the 19th century to explain how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially objected to [[natural selection]]. Many of these theories, including structural or developmental constraints, led (solid blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows). These theories were largely swept aside by the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[genetics]] and natural selection in the early 20th century (dashed orange arrows).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |author-link=Peter J.

===Geoffroy's law of compensation===
{{Main|Cuvier–Geoffroy debate}}

In 1830, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued a structuralist case against the functionalist ([[teleology in biology|teleological]]) position of [[Georges Cuvier]]. Geoffroy believed that [[homology (biology)|homologies]] of structure between animals indicated that they shared an ideal pattern; these did not imply evolution but a unity of plan, a law of nature.{{efn|In this, Geoffroy's homologies were like [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle's forms]].}} He further believed that if one part was more developed within a structure, the other parts would necessarily be reduced in compensation, as nature always used the same materials: if more of them were used for one feature, less was available for the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Racine |first=Valerie |title=Essay: The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/essay-cuvier-geoffroy-debate |publisher=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia, Arizona State University |date=7 October 2013 |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Thompson, the palaeontologist [[Adolf Seilacher]] emphasised fabricational constraints on form. He interpreted fossils such as ''[[Dickinsonia]]'' in the [[Ediacaran biota]] as "pneu" structures determined by mechanical inflation like a quilted [[air mattress]], rather than having been driven by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seilacher |first1=Adolf |title=Constructional Morphology and Evolution |editor1-last=Schmidt-Kittler|editor1-first=Norbert |editor2-last=Vogel |editor2-first=Klaus |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-76158-4 |date=1991 |pages=251–271|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-76156-0_17 |chapter=Self-Organizing Mechanisms in Morphogenesis and Evolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seilacher |first1=Adolf |author-link=Adolf Seilacher |title=Vendozoa: Organismic construction in the Proterozoic biosphere |journal=Lethaia |date=July 1989 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=229–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1989.tb01332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner's constraints on development===

In his 2014 book ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation'', the evolutionary biologist [[Günter P. Wagner]] argues for "the study of novelty as distinct from adaptation." He defines novelty as occurring when some part of the body develops an individual and quasi-independent existence, in other words as a distinct and recognisable structure, which he implies might occur before natural selection begins to adapt the structure for some function.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014&gt;[[Günter P. Wagner|Wagner, Günter P.]], ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation''.  Princeton University Press. 2014. {{ISBN|978-0691156460}}.

===Kauffman's self-organisation===
[[File:Fluid Mosaic.svg|thumb|Darwinists and structuralists agree that cell structures like the [[cell membrane]] spontaneously [[self-organization#Biology|self-organize]]. They disagree on how important [[self-organization]] is in other areas of biology.]]

The mathematical biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]] suggested in 1993 that [[self-organization#Biology|self-organization]] may play a role alongside [[natural selection]] in three areas of [[evolutionary biology]], namely [[population dynamics]], [[molecular evolution]], and [[morphogenesis]]. With respect to molecular biology, Kauffman has been criticised for ignoring the role of [[energy]] in driving [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] in cells, which can fairly be called self-[[catalysis|catalysing]] but which do not simply self-organise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=Ronald F. |title=Review of Stuart Kauffman, The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution |journal=Biophys.

The biochemist [[Michael Denton]]&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Denton|Denton, Michael]]. ''[[Evolution: A Theory in Crisis]]'', Adler &amp; Adler, 1985. ISBN 0-917561-52-X&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; has argued a structuralist case for self-organization. In a 2013 paper, he claimed that "the basic forms of the natural world—the Types—are immanent in nature, and determined by a set of special natural biological laws, the so called 'laws of form'." He asserts that these "recurring patterns and forms" are "genuine [[universals]]".{{efn|Universals are central to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] theory, [[Platonic realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=plato-metaphysics |title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology |last=Silverman |first=Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Form is in this view not shaped by natural selection, but by "self-organizing properties of particular categories of matter" and by "cosmic fine-tuning of the laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Michael J. |title=The Types: A Persistent Structuralist Challenge to Darwinian Pan-Selectionism |journal=BIO-Complexity |date=August 2013 |volume=2013 |issue=3 |doi=10.5048/BIO-C.2013.3 |url=http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2013.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denton has been criticised by the biochemist Laurence A.

{{main|Spandrel (biology)}}

In 1979, influenced by Seilacher among others, the [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen J. Gould]] and the [[population genetics|population geneticist]] [[Richard Lewontin]] wrote what Wagner called "the most influential structuralist manifesto", "[[The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm]]".&lt;ref name=GouldLewontin1979&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=Proc.

Instead, architects couldn't help creating small triangular areas between [[arch]]es and [[pillar]]s, as arches need (evolve) to be curved, and pillars need to be vertical. The resulting spandrels are [[exaptation]]s, consequences of other evolutionary changes. Evolution, they argued, did not select for a protruding human chin: instead, reducing the length of the tooth row left the jaw protruding.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt;

===Müller and Newman's pre-Mendelian evolution===

Extreme structuralists like [[Gerd B. Müller]] and Stuart A.

==Criticism==

While agreeing that pattern formation mechanisms such as those described by Goodwin exist, the biologists Richard Dawkins, Stephen J. Gould, [[Lynn Margulis]], and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have criticised Goodwin for suggesting that chemical signalling forms an alternative to natural selection.&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

Moran, a "skeptical biochemist", comments that 'structuralism' is a "new buzzword ... guaranteed to impress the creationist crowd because nobody understands what it means but it sounds very 'sciency' and philosophical."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt; The philosopher of science [[Paul E. Griffiths]] writes that structuralists "view this structuring of the space of biological possibility as part of the fundamental physical structure of nature. But the phenomena of phylogenetic inertia and developmental constraint do not support this interpretation. These phenomena show that the evolutionary pathways available to an organism are a function of the developmental structure of the organism."&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Paul E. |author-link=Paul E.

Moran summarizes: "There's nothing in science that supports the views of the structuralists. We have perfectly good explanations for why bumblebees are different than mushrooms and why all vertebrates have vertebrae and not exoskeletons. There's no evidence to support the idea that if you replay the tape of life it will come out looking anything like what we see today. You can be confident that when you visit another planet you will not find vertebrates."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

The [[evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biologist]] [[Lewis Held]] wrote that "The notion that aspects of anatomy can be explained by physical forces (like expansion cracking) was advocated ~ 100 years earlier in D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 ''On Growth and Form'' and in [[Theodore Andrea Cook|Theodore Cook]]'s 1914 book ''The Curves of Life''.{{efn|The artist Theodore Cook's ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028937179 The Curves of Life]'', Constable, 1914 to some extent anticipated D'Arcy Thompson, exploring [[spiral]]s in art and nature.}} Over the intervening century, various traits have been proposed to arise ''mechanically'' rather than ''genetically'': brain convolutions, cartilage condensations, flower corrugations, tooth cusps, and fish otoliths. To this kooky list we can now add the crooked smile of the crocodile, or at least the cracked skin that surrounds it."{{efn |Held's final point was that the cracks in the crocodile's skin are genuinely explained by cracking, unlike all the other examples he lists.&lt;ref name=Held2014/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Held2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Held |first=Lewis Irving |title=How the snake lost its legs: curious tales from the frontier of evo-devo |title-link=How the Snake Lost its Legs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom New York |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-62139-8 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5052" xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Subcloning.png|thumb|300px|right|This image diagrams the procedure of subcloning as outlined to the left.]]
In [[molecular biology]], '''subcloning''' is a technique used to move a particular DNA sequence from a ''parent [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]]'' to a ''destination vector''.
    
Subcloning is not to be confused with [[molecular cloning]], a related technique.

==Procedure==
[[Restriction enzyme]]s are used to excise the gene of interest (the ''insert'') from the parent.  The insert is purified in order to isolate it from other DNA molecules.  A common purification method is [[gel isolation]].  The number of copies of the gene is then amplified using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).

Simultaneously, the same [[restriction enzymes]] are used to digest (cut) the destination.  The idea behind using the same restriction enzymes is to create [[Complementary DNA|complementary]] [[sticky end]]s, which will facilitate [[DNA ligase|ligation]] later on.  A [[phosphatase]], commonly [[calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase]] (CIAP), is also added to prevent self-ligation of the destination vector.  The digested destination vector is isolated/purified.

The insert and the destination vector are then mixed together with DNA ligase.  A typical molar ratio of insert genes to destination vectors is 3:1;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jDoVFPR0AG0C&amp;q=ideal+ligation+molar+ratio&amp;pg=PA213 | author = Williams, Steven A. |display-authors=etal |date = 2006 | title = Laboratory Investigations in Molecular Biology | page = 213| isbn = 9780763733292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by increasing the insert concentration, self-ligation is further decreased.  After letting the reaction mixture sit for a set amount of time at a specific temperature (dependent upon the size of the strands being ligated; for more information see [[DNA ligase#Applications in molecular biology research|DNA ligase]]), the insert should become successfully incorporated into the destination [[plasmid]].

==Amplification of product plasmid==
The plasmid is often [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] into a [[bacteria|bacterium]] like ''E. coli''. Ideally when the bacterium [[fission (biology)|divides]] the plasmid should also be replicated.  In the best case scenario, each bacterial cell should have several copies of the plasmid.  After a good number of bacterial colonies have grown, they can be [[Plasmid preparation|miniprepped]] to harvest the plasmid DNA.

==Selection==
In order to ensure growth of only transformed bacteria (which carry the desired plasmids to be harvested), a [[marker gene]] is used in the destination vector for [[genetic screen|selection]].  Typical marker genes are for [[antibiotic resistance]] or nutrient [[biosynthesis]]. So, for example, the "marker gene" could be for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. If the bacteria that were supposed to pick up the desired plasmid had picked up the desired gene then they would also contain the "marker gene". Now the bacteria that picked up the plasmid would be able to grow in ampicillin whereas the bacteria that did not pick up the desired plasmid would still be vulnerable to destruction by the ampicillin. Therefore, successfully transformed bacteria would be "selected."

==Example case: bacterial plasmid subcloning==
In this example, a gene from mammalian gene library will be subcloned into a bacterial plasmid (destination platform).  The bacterial plasmid is a piece of circular DNA which contains regulatory elements allowing for the bacteria to produce a gene product ([[gene expression]]) if it is placed in the correct place in the plasmid.  The production site is flanked by two restriction enzyme cutting sites "A" and "B" with incompatible sticky ends.

The mammalian DNA does not come with these restriction sites, so they are built in by [[Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction|overlap extension PCR]].  The primers are designed to put the restriction sites carefully, so that the coding of the protein is in-frame, and a minimum of extra amino acids is implanted on either side of the protein.

Both the PCR product containing the mammalian gene with the new restriction sites and the destination plasmid are subjected to restriction digestion, and the digest products are purified by [[gel electrophoresis]].

The digest products, now containing compatible sticky ends with each other (but incompatible sticky ends with themselves) are subjected to ligation, creating a new plasmid which contains the background elements of the original plasmid with a different insert.

The plasmid is [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] into bacteria and the identity of the insert is confirmed by [[DNA sequencing]].

{{Biological classification}}
In [[zoological nomenclature]], a '''subphylum''' is a [[taxonomic rank]] below the rank of [[phylum]].

The taxonomic rank of "[[subdivision (rank)|subdivision]]" in [[fungi]] and [[plant taxonomy]] is equivalent to "subphylum" in zoological taxonomy. Some plant taxonomists have also used the rank of subphylum, for instance [[monocotyledons]] as a subphylum of phylum [[Angiospermae]] and [[vertebrates]] as a subphylum of phylum [[Chordata]].{{sfn|Hutchinson|1973}}

== Taxonomic rank ==
Subphylum is:
#subordinate to the [[phylum]] 
#superordinate to the '''infraphylum'''.

Where convenient, subphyla in turn can be divided into '''infraphyla'''; in turn such an '''infraphylum''' also would be superordinate to any classes or superclasses in the [[hierarchy]].

== Examples ==
Not all fauna phyla are divided into subphyla. Those that are include: 
*[[Arthropod]]a: divided into subphyla [[Trilobitomorpha]], [[Chelicerata]], [[Myriapoda]], [[Hexapoda]] and [[Crustacean|Crustacea]],
*[[Brachiopoda]]: divided into subphyla [[Linguliformea]], [[Craniformea]] and [[Rhynchonelliformea]],
*[[Chordata]]: divided into [[Tunicate|Tunicata]], [[Lancelet|Cephalochordata]], and its largest subphylum [[Vertebrata]].

Examples of '''infraphyla''' include the [[Mycetozoa]], the [[Gnathostomata]] and the [[Agnatha]].

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], '''subspecies''' is a rank below [[species]], used for populations that live in different areas and vary in size, shape, or other physical characteristics ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]), but that can successfully interbreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |year=1982 |title=Of what use are subspecies? |journal=The Auk |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=593–595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Monroe, B. L. |year=1982 |title=A modern concept of the subspecies |journal=The Auk |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=608–609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all species have subspecies, but for those that do there must be at least two. Subspecies is abbreviated '''subsp.''' or '''ssp.''' and the singular and plural forms are the same ("the subspecies is" or "the subspecies are").

In [[zoology]], under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name. In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], other [[infraspecific name|infraspecific ranks]], such as [[variety (botany)|variety]], may be named. In [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]], under standard [[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|bacterial nomenclature]] and [[virus classification|virus nomenclature]], there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks.

A taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies. A common criterion for recognizing two distinct populations as subspecies rather than full species is the ability of them to [[interbreeding|interbreed]] even if some male offspring may be sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Species – Speciation|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/species-taxon|access-date=20 April 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, subspecies do not interbreed due to [[Allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] or [[sexual selection]]. The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species.

==Nomenclature==
The [[scientific name]] of a species is a [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] or binomen, and comprises two [[Latin]] words, the first denoting the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] and the second denoting the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Linné |first1=C. |year=1735 |title=Systema naturae, sive, Regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species |location=Lugduni Batavorum |publisher=Theodor Haak |url=https://archive.org/details/mobot31753002972252/page/n1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name of a subspecies is formed slightly differently in the different nomenclature codes. In zoology, under the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN''), the scientific name of a subspecies is termed a [[trinomen]], and comprises three words, namely the binomen followed by the name of the subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ride, W. D. L. |editor2=Corliss, J. O. |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature: Adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences |location=London |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |edition=Fourth |url=http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/271138.pdf |isbn=0853010064}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the binomen for the [[leopard]] is ''Panthera pardus''. The trinomen ''Panthera pardus fusca'' denotes a subspecies, the [[Indian leopard]].&lt;ref name="Catsg2017"/&gt; All components of the trinomen are written in italics.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web

In [[botany]], subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species, such as [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[subvariety]], [[form (botany)|form]], and subform. To identify the rank, the subspecific name must be preceded by "subspecies" (which can be abbreviated to "subsp." or "ssp."), as in [[Totora (plant)|''Schoenoplectus californicus'' subsp. ''tatora'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Mallet |title=Subspecies, semispecies, superspecies |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Sp/Sub-semi.pdf |website=ucl.ac.uk |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Microbiology|bacteriology]], the only rank below species that is regulated explicitly by the code of nomenclature is ''subspecies'', but infrasubspecific taxa are extremely important in bacteriology; Appendix 10 of the code lays out some recommendations that are intended to encourage uniformity in describing such taxa. Names published before 1992 in the rank of ''variety'' are taken to be names of subspecies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=icnb&amp;part=A185 "Chapter 3: Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations"]. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]. Retrieved 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes]]'').  As in botany, ''subspecies'' is conventionally abbreviated as "subsp.", and is used in the scientific name: ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' subsp. ''spizizenii''.&lt;ref name="ICNP 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |at="Names of Subspecies: Rule 13a"&lt;!--This document is not page-numbered.--&gt; |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (2008 Revision) |date=20 November 2015 |orig-year=2008 |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |edition=ICSP Matters |volume=69|issue=&lt;!--Appears to have been a special stand-alone issue; no vol./issue numbers specified.--&gt; |first1=Charles T. |last1=Parker |first2=Brian J. |last2=Tindall |first3=George M. |last3=Garrity |doi=10.1099/ijsem.0.000778|pmid=26596770 |doi-access=free }} Full text available from PDF link at this page; direct URL to PDF is auto-generated and expires.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominotypical subspecies and subspecies autonyms===
{{anchor|Nominate subspecies|Autonymous subspecies|Nominotypical subspecies and subspecies autonyms|reason=previous section names, and term anchors}}
In [[zoological nomenclature]], when a species is split into subspecies, the originally described population is retained as the "nominotypical subspecies"&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.iczn.org/species-group-nominal-taxa-and-their-names/article-47-nominotypical-taxa/?frame=1 International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; or "nominate subspecies", which repeats the same name as the species. For example, ''Motacilla alba alba'' (often abbreviated ''M. a. alba'') is the nominotypical subspecies of the [[white wagtail]] (''Motacilla alba'').

The subspecies name that repeats the species name is referred to in [[botanical nomenclature]] as the subspecies "[[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]", and the subspecific taxon as the "autonymous subspecies".&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeill |first1=J. |last2=Barrie |first2=F. R. |last3=Buck |first3=W. R. |last4=Demoulin |first4=V. |last5=Greuter |first5=W. |last6=Hawksworth |first6=D. L. |last7=Herendeen |first7=P. S. |last8=Knapp |first8=S. |last9=Marhold |first9=K. |last10=Prado |first10=J. |last11=Prud'homme Van Reine |first11=W.F. |last12=Smith |first12=G. F. |last13=Wiersema |first13=J.

Gantner Verlag KG |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doubtful cases===
When zoologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species, the species name may be written in parentheses. Thus ''Larus (argentatus) smithsonianus'' means the [[American herring gull]]; the notation within the parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger [[European herring gull|herring gull]] species and therefore call it ''Larus argentatus smithsonianus'', while others consider it a full species and therefore call it ''Larus smithsonianus'' (and the user of the notation is not taking a position).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Criteria==
A subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species – the only such rank recognized in the zoological code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |title=ICZN Glossary |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |editor1-first=Gary |editor1-last=Rosenberg |display-editors=etal |url= http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of three main ranks below species in the botanical code.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; When geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter J. |last1=Russell |first2=Paul E. |last2=Hertz |first3=Beverly |last3=McMillan |title=Biology: The Dynamic Science |publisher=Brooks/Cole California |date=2011 |chapter=21: Speciation |page=456 |isbn=978-1133418849 |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jSw9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Botanists and mycologists have the choice of ranks lower than subspecies, such as variety (varietas) or form (forma), to recognize smaller differences between populations.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;

==Monotypic and polytypic species==
[[File:One_horn_Rhino_in_Kaziranga_national_park.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis'') is a [[monotypic]] species]]

In biological terms, rather than in relation to nomenclature, a [[Polytypic taxon|polytypic]] species has two or more genetically and phenotypically divergent subspecies, [[Race (biology)|races]], or more generally speaking, [[population]]s that differ from each other so that a separate description is warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayr |first1=E. |author-link=Ernst Mayr |title=Populations, Species, and Evolution: An Abridgment of Animal Species and Evolution |url=https://archive.org/details/populationsspeci00mayr |url-access=registration |year=1970 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674690103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These distinct groups do not interbreed as they are isolated from another, but they can interbreed and have fertile offspring, e.g. in captivity. These subspecies, races, or populations, are usually [[scientific description|described]] and [[Scientific name|named]] by zoologists, botanists and microbiologists.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In a [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] species, all populations exhibit the same genetic and phenotypical characteristics. Monotypic species can occur in several ways:{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}
* All members of the species are very similar and cannot be sensibly divided into biologically significant subcategories.
* The individuals vary considerably, but the variation is essentially random and largely meaningless so far as genetic transmission of these variations is concerned.
* The variation among individuals is noticeable and follows a pattern, but there are no clear dividing lines among separate groups: they fade imperceptibly into one another. Such [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] variation always indicates substantial [[gene flow]] among the apparently separate groups that make up the population(s). Populations that have a steady, substantial gene flow among them are likely to represent a monotypic species, even when a fair degree of genetic variation is obvious.

      <text bytes="15517" xml:space="preserve">In [[food safety]], the concept of '''substantial equivalence''' holds that the safety of a new food, particularly one that has been [[Genetic engineering techniques|genetically modified]] (GM), may be assessed by comparing it with a similar traditional food that has proven safe in normal use over time.&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/science/biotrack/41036698.pdf Safety Evaluation of Foods Derived by Modern Biotechnology: Concepts and Principles] OECD (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; It was first formulated as a food safety policy in 1993, by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name="agbiotechnet"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/schauzu.pdf | title=The concept of substantial equivalence in safety assessment of foods derived from genetically modified organisms | author=Schauzu, Marianna | journal=[[AgBiotechNet]]  | date=Apr 2000 | volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a food safety testing process, substantial equivalence is the initial step, establishing [[Toxicology|toxicological]] and [[nutrition]]al differences in the new food compared to a conventional counterpart—differences are analyzed and evaluated, and further testing may be conducted, leading to a final safety assessment.&lt;ref name="kok"/&gt;

Substantial equivalence is the underlying principle in GM food safety assessment for a number of national and international agencies, including the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA), Japan's [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] (MHLW), the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and  [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="councilforbiotechinfo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thebeuselaer.weebly.com/uploads/6/3/8/4/6384873/substantial_equivalence.pdf | title=Substantial Equivalence in Food Safety Assessment | publisher=Council for Biotechnology Information | date=March 2001 | access-date=6 February 2016 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207101449/http://thebeuselaer.weebly.com/uploads/6/3/8/4/6384873/substantial_equivalence.pdf | archive-date=7 February 2016 }} () ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131227220643/http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/schauzu.pdf Page archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The concept of comparing genetically modified foods to traditional foods as a basis for safety assessment was first introduced as a recommendation during the 1990 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on biotechnology and food safety (a scientific conference of officials and industry), although the term ''substantial equivalence'' was not used.&lt;ref name="faowho1996"&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/esn/food/biotechnology.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518130948/ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/esn/food/biotechnology.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-05-18 |title=Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Biotechnology and Food Safety |publisher=FAO/WHO |date=October 1990 |access-date=16 February 2016}} "Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on the Assessment of Biotechnology in Food Production and Processing as Related to Food Safety" (1990)&lt;br/&gt;"When molecular, microbial, genetic and chemical data establish that the food or food ingredient is sufficiently similar to its conventional counterpart, only minimal toxicological testing will generally be required." - Section 6.3.1, "Strategies for Assessing the Safety of Foods Produced by Biotechnology", report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="millstone"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Beyond 'substantial equivalence' |last1=Millstone |first1=Erik |last2=Brunner |first2=Eric |last3=Mayer |first3=Sue |journal=Nature |volume=401 |date=October 1999 |issue=6753 |pages=525–526|doi=10.1038/44006 |pmid = 10524614|bibcode=1999Natur.401..525M |s2cid=4307069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting the term, ''substantial equivalence'' was formulated as a food safety policy by the OECD, first described in their 1993 report, "Safety Evaluation of Foods Derived by Modern Biotechnology: Concepts and Principles.&lt;ref name="agbiotechnet"/&gt; The term was borrowed from the FDA's 1976 substantial equivalence definition for new [[medical devices]]—under [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act#Medical devices|Premarket Notification 510(k)]], a new [[Medical device#United States|Class II]] device that is essentially similar to an existing device can be cleared for release without further testing.&lt;ref name="agbiotechnet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fda510k"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/ |title=Premarket Notification 510(k) |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) |date=16 Sep 2015 |access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;br/&gt;"A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device ... that is not subject to PMS [Premarket Approval]. Submitters must compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support their substantial equivalency claims."&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying approach of comparing a new product or technique to an existing one has long been used in various fields of science and technology.&lt;ref name="agbiotechnet"/&gt;

==Description==
The OECD bases the substantial equivalence principle on a definition of food safety where we can assume that a food is safe for consumption if it has been eaten over time without evident harm. It recognizes that traditional foods may naturally contain toxic components (usually called [[antinutrients]])—such as the [[glycoalkaloid]]s [[solanine]] in potatoes and [[Tomatine|alpha-tomatine]] in tomatoes—which do not affect their safety when prepared and eaten in traditional ways.&lt;ref name="biotech-info.net"&gt;[http://www.biotech-info.net/antinutrients.html Substantial equivalence of antinutrients and inherent plant toxins in genetically modified novel foods, Novak, W.

In principle, food has been presumed to be safe unless a significant hazard was identified." (OECD, 1993)&lt;ref name="oecd"/&gt;}}

The report proposes that, while biotechnology broadens the scope of food modification, it does not inherently introduce additional risk, and therefore, GM products may be assessed in the same way as conventionally bred products.&lt;ref name="oecd"/&gt; Further, the relative precision of biotech methods should allow assessment to be focused on the most likely problem areas.&lt;ref name="oecd"/&gt; The concept of substantial equivalence is then described as a comparison between a GM food and a similar conventional food, taking into account food processing, and how the food is normally consumed, including quantity, dietary patterns, and the characteristics of the consumer population.{{refn|group=note|"For foods and food components from organisms developed by the application of modern biotechnology, the most practical approach to the determination of safety is to consider whether they are ''substantially equivalent'' to analogous conventional food products, if such exist. Account should be taken of the processing that the food may undergo, as well as the intended use and the exposure. ''Exposure'' includes such parameters as the amount of food or food component(s) in the diet, the pattern of dietary consumption, and the characteristics of the consuming population(s). The approach provides a basis for an evaluation of food safety and nutritional quality." (OECD, 1993)&lt;ref name="oecd"/&gt;}}
&lt;!--A quote from FAO, one of the agencies that developed the concept, is useful for defining it: "Substantial equivalence embodies the concept that if a new food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component, it can be treated in the same manner with respect to safety (i.e., the food or food component can be concluded to be as safe as the conventional food or food component)".&lt;ref&gt;Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Biotechnology and Food Safety.

==Assessment process==
Substantial equivalence is the starting point for GM food safety assessment. It can be applied at different points in the food chain, from unprocessed harvested crop to final ingredient or product, depending on the nature of the product and its intended use.&lt;ref name="faotools"/&gt; For a GM plant, the overall evaluation process may be viewed in four phases:&lt;ref name="kok"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kok EJ, Kuiper HA |title=Comparative safety assessment for biotech crops |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=21 |url=http://www.ask-force.org/web/Food/Kok-Comparative-Safety-2003.pdf |issue=10 |pages=439–44 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14512230 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2003.08.003 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214044505/http://www.ask-force.org/web/Food/Kok-Comparative-Safety-2003.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-14 }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Substantial equivalence analysis'''&lt;br/&gt;Considering introduced genes, newly expressed proteins, and new secondary metabolites
#'''Toxicological and nutritional analysis''' of detected differences&lt;br/&gt;Gene transfer, allergenicity, degradation characteristics, bioavailability, toxicity, and estimated intake levels
#'''Toxicological and nutritional evaluation'''&lt;br/&gt;If necessary, additional toxicity testing, possibly including whole foods (return to Phase 2).
#'''Final safety assessment of GM plant'''
&lt;!--A 2003 review in ''[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Biotechnology]]'' identifies seven main components of a standard safety test:&lt;ref name="kok"&gt;
# Study of the introduced DNA and the new proteins or [[metabolite]]s that it produces;
# Analysis of the chemical composition of the relevant plant parts, measuring nutrients, antinutrients, and any natural toxins or known allergens;
# Assess the risk of gene transfer from the food to microorganisms in the [[Gut (anatomy)|human gut]];
# Study the possibility that any new components in the food might be allergens;
# Estimate how much of a normal diet the food will make up;
# Estimate any toxicological or nutritional problems revealed by data comparison with equivalent foods;
# Additional animal toxicity tests if there is the possibility that the food might pose a risk.--&gt;

==Technological developments==
There has been discussion about applying new [[biochemical]] concepts and methods in evaluating substantial equivalence, such as [[Metabolomics|metabolic profiling]] and [[Proteomics|protein profiling]].  These concepts refer, respectively, to the complete measured biochemical spectrum (total fingerprint) of compounds (metabolites) or of proteins present in a food or crop.  The goal would be to compare overall the biochemical profile of a new food to an existing food to see if the new food's profile falls within the range of natural variation already exhibited by the profile of existing foods or crops.  However, these techniques are not considered sufficiently evaluated, and standards have not yet been developed, to apply them.&lt;ref name="fao2000"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/agns/pdf/topics/ec_june2000_en.pdf | title=Safety aspects of genetically modified foods of plant origin | publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) | date=June 2000 |at=4.

==Adoption==
Approaches to GM food regulation vary by country, while substantial equivalence is generally the underlying principle of GM food safety assessment. This is the case for national and international agencies that include the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA), Japan's [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] (MHLW), the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and  [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="faotools"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/index.php | title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms | publisher=Library of Congress | date=9 Jun 2015 | access-date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="councilforbiotechinfo"/&gt; In 1997, the [[European Union]] established a [[novel food]] assessment procedure whereby, once the producer has confirmed substantial equivalence with an existing food, government notification, with accompanying scientific evidence, is the only requirement for commercial release, however, foods containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are excluded and require mandatory authorization.&lt;ref name="agbiotechnet"/&gt;

To establish substantial equivalence, the modified product is tested by the manufacturer for unexpected changes to a targeted set of components such as [[toxin]]s, [[nutrient]]s, or [[allergen]]s, that are present in a similar unmodified food.  The manufacturer's data is then assessed by a regulatory agency. If regulators determine that there is no significant difference between the modified and unmodified products, then there will generally be no further requirement for food safety testing. However, if the product has no natural equivalent, or shows significant differences from the unmodified food, or for other reasons that regulators may have (for instance, if a [[gene]] produces a protein that has not been a food component before), further safety testing may be required.&lt;ref name="oecd"/&gt;

{{About|the surfaces on which organisms live|enzyme substrates|Enzyme substrate (biology)}}
In [[biology]], a '''substrate''' is the surface on which an [[organism]] (such as a [[plant]], [[fungus]], or [[animal]]) lives. A substrate can include biotic or abiotic materials and animals. For example, encrusting algae that lives on a [[rock (geology)|rock]] (its substrate) can be itself a substrate for an animal that lives on top of the algae. [[Hydroponics#Substrates_(growing_support_materials)|Inert substrates]] are used as growing support materials in the [[hydroponics|hydroponic]] cultivation of plants. In biology substrates are often activated by the nanoscopic process of [[substrate presentation]].

==In animal biotechnology==
=== Requirements for animal cell and tissue culture ===
Requirements for animal cell and tissue culture are the same as described for plant cell, tissue and organ culture (In Vitro Culture Techniques: The Biotechnological Principles). Desirable requirements are (i) air conditioning of a room, (ii) hot room with [[temperature]] recorder, (iii) microscope room for carrying out microscopic work where different types of [[Microscope|microscopes]] should be installed, (iv) [[dark room]], (v) service room, (vi) sterilization room for [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of glassware and culture media, and (vii) preparation room for media preparation, etc. In addition the storage areas should be such where following should be kept properly : (i) [[liquid]]s-ambient (4-20°C), (ii) glassware-shelving, (iii) plastics-shelving, (iv) small items-drawers, (v) specialized equipments-cupboard, slow turnover, (vi) chemicals-sidled containers.

=== For cell growth ===
There are many types of vertebrate [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that require support for their growth in vitro otherwise they will not grow properly. Such cells are called anchorage-dependent cells. Therefore, many substrates which may be [[adhesive]] (e.g. [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[palladium]], metallic surfaces, etc.) or non-adhesive (e.g. [[agar]], [[agarose]], etc.) types may be used as discussed below:
*[[Plastic]] as a substrate. Disposable plastics are cheaper substrate as they are commonly made up of [[polystyrene]]. After use they should be disposed of properly. Before use they are treated with [[Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]] or [[electric arc]] simply to develop charges on the surface of substrate. After cell growth its rate of proliferation should be measured. In addition, the other plastic materials used as substrate are [[teflon]] or [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), [[Thermalox|thermamox]] (TPX), [[Polyvinyl chloride|polyvinylchloride]] (PVC), [[polycarbonate]], etc. [[Monolayer]] of cell must be grown. Moreover, plastic beads of polystyrene, [[sephadex]] and [[polyacrylamide]] are also available for cell growth in suspension culture.
*[[Glass]] as a substrate. Glass is an important substrate used in laboratory in several forms such as test tubes, slides, coverslips, pipettes, flasks, rods, bottles, Petri dishes, several apparatus, etc. These are sterilized by using chemicals, [[radiation]]s, dry heat (in oven) and moist heat (in autoclave).
*[[Palladium]] as a substrate. For the first time palladium deposited on [[agarose]] was used as a substrate for growth of [[fibroblast]] and [[glia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biocyclopedia.com/index/biotechnology/animal_biotechnology/animal_cell_tissue_and_organ_culture/biotech_requirements_animal_cell_tissue_organ.php|title=Requirements for Animal Cell and Tissue Culture - Animal Biotech|last=Biocyclopedia.com|website=biocyclopedia.com|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The substrate is the material acted upon. In the case of an interaction with an enzyme, the protein or organic substrate typically changes chemical form. Substrate presentation differs from [[allosteric regulation]] in that the enzyme need not change its conformation to begin catalysis. Substrate presentation is best described for [[nanoscopic scale|nanoscopic]] distances (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;nm).

== Examples ==

=== Amyloid Precursor Protein ===
[[Amyloid precursor protein]] (APP) is cleaved by beta and [[gamma secretase]] to yield a 40-42 amino acid peptide responsible for beta amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. The enzymes are regulated by substrate presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Hao |last2=Kulas |first2=Joshua A. |last3=Wang |first3=Chao |last4=Holtzman |first4=David M. |last5=Ferris |first5=Heather A. |last6=Hansen |first6=Scott B. |title=Regulation of beta-amyloid production in neurons by astrocyte-derived cholesterol |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=17 August 2021 |volume=118 |issue=33 |pages=e2102191118 |pmid=34385305|doi=10.1073/pnas.2102191118 |pmc=8379952 |language=en |issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The substrate APP is palmitoylated and moves in and out of GM1 lipid rafts in response to astrocyte cholesterol. Cholesterol delivered by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) drives APP to associate with GM1 lipid rafts. When cholesterol is low, the protein traffics to the disordered region and is cleaved by alpha secretase to produce a non-amylogenic product. The enzymes do not appear to respond to cholesterol, only the substrate moves.

[[Hydrophobicity]] drives the partitioning of molecules. In the cell, this gives rise to compartmentalization within the cell and within [[cell membrane]]s.  For lipid rafts, [[palmitoylation]] regulates raft affinity for the majority of integral raft proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levental |first1=I |last2=Lingwood |first2=D |last3=Grzybek |first3=M |last4=Coskun |first4=U |last5=Simons |first5=K |title=Palmitoylation regulates raft affinity for the majority of integral raft proteins. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=21 December 2010 |volume=107 |issue=51 |pages=22050–4 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1016184107 |pmid=21131568|pmc=3009825 |bibcode=2010PNAS..10722050L |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raft regulation is regulated by [[cholesterol signaling]].

=== Phospholipase D2 ===
([[PLD2]]) is a well-defined example of an enzyme activated by substrate presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=EN |last2=Chung |first2=HW |last3=Nayebosadri |first3=A |last4=Hansen |first4=SB |title=Kinetic disruption of lipid rafts is a mechanosensor for phospholipase D. |journal=Nature Communications |date=15 December 2016 |volume=7 |pages=13873 |doi=10.1038/ncomms13873 |pmid=27976674|pmc=5171650 |bibcode=2016NatCo...713873P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The enzyme is [[palmitoylation|palmitoylated]] causing the enzyme to traffic to GM1 lipid domains or "[[lipid rafts]]". The substrate of [[phospholipase D]] is [[phosphatidylcholine]] (PC) which is unsaturated and is of low abundance in lipid rafts. PC localizes to the disordered region of the cell along with the polyunsaturated lipid [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] ([[PIP2]]). PLD2 has a PIP2 [[binding domain]]. When PIP2 concentration in the membrane increases, PLD2 leaves the GM1 domains and binds to PIP2 where it then gains access to its substrate PC and commences catalysis based on substrate presentation. Presumably, the enzyme is capable of catalyzing a reaction in a lipid raft but lacks a substrate for activity.
[[File:Enzyme translocation.png|thumb|right|upright=2|'''Enzyme translocation'''; PLD (blue oval) is sequestered into cholesterol-dependent lipid domains (green lipids) by [[palmitoylation]]. PLD also binds PIP2(red hexagon) domains (grey shading) located separate from GM1 clusters in the plasma membrane and near phosphatidylcholine (PC). When PIP2 increases in the cell PLD translocates to PIP2 where it is exposed to and hydrolyzes PC to phosphatidic acid (red spherical lipid).]]

=== Inflammation ===
([[ADAM17]]), also called TACE, is sequestered into lipid rafts away from its substrate, membrane bound [[tumor necrosis factor]] (mTNF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tellier |first1=Edwige |last2=Canault |first2=Matthias |last3=Rebsomen |first3=Laure |last4=Bonardo |first4=Bernadette |last5=Juhan-Vague |first5=Irène |last6=Nalbone |first6=Gilles |last7=Peiretti |first7=Franck |title=The shedding activity of ADAM17 is sequestered in lipid rafts |journal=Experimental Cell Research |date=10 December 2006 |volume=312 |issue=20 |pages=3969–3980 |doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.08.027 |pmid=17010968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholesterol causes mTNF to cluster with ADAM17 in lipid rafts and shed soluble TNF (sTNF) which is an inflammatory cytokine.

=== SARS-CoV-2 ===
([[Furin]]) (producing cell, replication). When cells are loaded with cholesterol furin traffics to GM1 lipid rafts where it is localized with the palmitoylated spike protein of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]] and primes it for viral entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Hao |last2=Yuan |first2=Zixuan |last3=Pavel |first3=Mahmud Arif |last4=Hansen |first4=Scott B. |title=The role of high cholesterol in age-related COVID19 lethality |journal=bioRxiv |date=29 May 2020 |pages=2020.05.09.086249 |doi=10.1101/2020.05.09.086249 |pmid=32511366 |pmc=7263494 |url=https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.086249 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

([[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2|ACE2]]) (target Cell, viral entry), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 traffics SARS-CoV-2 to GM1 lipid rafts where it is endocytosed and exposed to cathepsin for cleavage and optimal cells fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Hao |last2=Yuan |first2=Zixuan |last3=Pavel |first3=Mahmud Arif |last4=Hansen |first4=Scott B. |title=The role of high cholesterol in age-related COVID19 lethality |journal=bioRxiv |date=29 May 2020 |pages=2020.05.09.086249 |doi=10.1101/2020.05.09.086249 |pmid=32511366 |pmc=7263494 |url=https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.086249 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In low cholesterol ACE2 traffics the virus to TMPRSS2 which also cleaves and allows viral entry but through a surface mechanism that is much less efficient. The sensitivity of ACE2 to cholesterol is thought to contribute to less severe [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID19]] symptoms in children.

== Mechanisms of activation ==

=== Sequestration ===
Within the plasma membrane, sequestration is primarily driven by packing of saturated lipid with cholesterol or phase separation at very small distances (&lt; 100&amp;nbsp;nm). At a macroscopic level, [[organelles]] and [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] can limit access of an enzyme with to substrate.
Either the substrate of the enzyme can move. Movement is typically the disruption of [[palmitate mediated localization]] or [[organelle trafficking]]. For proteins that are both palmitoylated and bind PIP2, increasing the concentration of PIP2 favors trafficking of the enzyme out of lipid rafts to PIP2. PIP2 is primarily polyunsaturated which causes the lipid to localize away from lipid rafts and allows the PIP2 to oppose palmitate mediated localization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hansen |first1=SB |title=Lipid agonism: The PIP2 paradigm of ligand-gated ion channels. |journal=  Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids|date=May 2015 |volume=1851 |issue=5 |pages=620–8 |doi=10.1016/j.bbalip.2015.01.011 |pmid=25633344|pmc=4540326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
=== Cholesterol ===
[[Cholesterol]] and [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFAs) regulate lipid raft formation, hence the biological function of rafts. When saturated lipids and cholesterol increase in the membrane, lipid rafts increase their affinity for palmitoylated proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levental |first1=I |last2=Lingwood |first2=D |last3=Grzybek |first3=M |last4=Coskun |first4=U |last5=Simons |first5=K |title=Palmitoylation regulates raft affinity for the majority of integral raft proteins. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=21 December 2010 |volume=107 |issue=51 |pages=22050–4 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1016184107 |pmid=21131568|pmc=3009825 |bibcode=2010PNAS..10722050L |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; PUFAs have the opposite effect, they fluidize the membrane.

=== PUFAs ===
PUFAs may also increase the concentration of signaling lipids. The arachidonic acid, a very common PUFA in the brain, incorporates into PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bioRxiv |last1=Petersen |first1=E. Nicholas |last2=Gudheti |first2=Manasa |last3=Pavel |first3=Mahmud Arif |last4=Murphy |first4=Keith R. |last5=Ja |first5=William W. |last6=Jorgensen |first6=Erik M. |last7=Hansen |first7=Scott B. |title=Phospholipase D Transduces Force to TREK-1 Channels in a Biological Membrane  |date=5 September 2019  |biorxiv=10.1101/758896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arachidonyl PC is a preferred substrate of PLD likely increasing the amount of PA in a cell.  Regulation of raft function by cholesterol effectively regulates substrate presentation and the many palmitoylated proteins that utilize substrate presentation as a mechanism of activation. While speculative, the profound effect of cholesterol and PUFAs on human health is likely through physiological regulation of lipid raft function in cells.

== Role in biology ==
=== Mechanosensation ===
Mechanical force (shear or swell) can independently disrupt the packing and resultant affinity of palmitate to lipid rafts.

'''Subtelomeres''' are segments of DNA between telomeric caps and chromatin.

== Structure ==
[[Telomere]]s are specialized [[protein]]–[[DNA]] constructs present at the ends of [[eukaryotic]] chromosomes, which prevent them from degradation and end-to-end [[chromosome|chromosomal]] fusion. Most [[vertebrate]] telomeric DNA consists of long ([[Thymine|T]][[Thymine|T]][[Adenine|A]][[Guanine|G]][[Guanine|G]][[Guanine|G]])n repeats of variable length, often around 3-20kb. ''Subtelomeres'' are segments of DNA between telomeric caps and [[chromatin]]. In vertebrates, each chromosome has two subtelomeres immediately adjacent to the long (TTAGGG)n repeats. Subtelomeres are considered to be the most distal (farthest from the [[centromere]]) region of unique DNA on a chromosome, and they are unusually dynamic and variable mosaics of multichromosomal blocks of sequence. The subtelomeres of such diverse species as humans, ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' are structurally similar in that they are composed of various repeated elements, but the extent of the subtelomeres and the sequence of the elements vary greatly among organisms.&lt;ref name=pmid11836503/&gt; In yeast (''S. cerevisiae''), subtelomeres are composed of two domains: the proximal and distal (telomeric) domains. The two domains differ in sequence content and extent of homology to other chromosome ends, and they are often separated by a stretch of degenerate telomere repeats (TTAGGG) and an element called 'core X', which is found at all chromosome ends and contains an [[autonomously replicating sequence]] (ARS) and an ABF1 binding site.&lt;ref name="Louis1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Louis |first1=E.

== Properties ==
This structure with repeated sequences is responsible for frequent duplication events, which create new genes, and recombination events, at the origin of combination diversity. These properties generate diversity at an individual scale and therefore contribute to adaptation of organisms to their environments. For example, in ''Plasmodium falciparum'' during [[interphase]] of the [[Plasmodium falciparum biology|erythrocytic stage]], the chromosomic extremities are gathered at the cell nucleus periphery, where they undergo frequent [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]] and telomere [[position effect]] (TPE). This event, in addition to expansion and deletion of subtelomeric repeats, gives rise to chromosome size polymorphisms and thus, subtelomeres undergo [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] and genetic controls. Because of the properties of subtelomeres, ''Plasmodium falciparum'' evades host immunity by varying the antigenic and adhesive character of infected erythrocytes (see Subtelomeric transcripts).&lt;ref name="Rubio1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubio |first1=J P |last2=Thompson |first2=J K |last3=Cowman |first3=A F |title=The var genes of Plasmodium falciparum are located in the subtelomeric region of most chromosomes. |journal=The EMBO Journal |date=1 August 1996 |volume=15 |issue=15 |pages=4069–4077 |doi=10.1002/j.1460-2075.1996.tb00780.x |pmid=8670911 |pmc=452127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Su1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Su |first1=Xin-zhuan |last2=Heatwole |first2=Virginia M. |last3=Wertheimer |first3=Samuel P. |last4=Guinet |first4=Frangoise |last5=Herrfeldt |first5=Jacqueline A. |last6=Peterson |first6=David S. |last7=Ravetch |first7=Jeffrey A. |last8=Wellems |first8=Thomas E. |title=The large diverse gene family var encodes proteins involved in cytoadherence and antigenic variation of plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes |journal=Cell |date=July 1995 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=89–100 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90055-1 |pmid=7606788 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Variation of subtelomeric regions are mostly variation on STRs, due to [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] of large-scale stretches delimited by (TTAGGG)n-like repeated sequences, which play an important role in recombination and transcription. [[Haplotype]] (DNA sequence variants) and length differences are therefore observed between individuals.

== Subtelomeric transcripts ==
Subtelomeric transcripts largely consist of either [[pseudogene]]s (transcribed genes producing RNA sequences not translated into protein) or [[gene families]]. In humans, they code for [[olfactory receptor]]s, [[immunoglobulin heavy chain]]s, and [[zinc-finger protein]]s. In other species, several parasites such as ''[[Plasmodium]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'' have developed sophisticated evasion mechanisms to adapt to the hostile environment posed by the host, such as exposing variable surface [[antigen]]s to escape the immune system. Genes coding for surface antigens in these organisms are located at subtelomeric regions, and it has been speculated that this preferred location facilitates gene switching and expression, and the generation of new variants.&lt;ref name="Cano2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cano |first1=Maria Isabel N |title=Telomere biology of Trypanosomatids: more questions than answers |journal=Trends in Parasitology |date=September 2001 |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=425–429 |doi=10.1016/S1471-4922(01)02014-1 |pmid=11530354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barry |first1=J.D. |last2=Ginger |first2=M.L. |last3=Burton |first3=P. |last4=McCulloch |first4=R. |title=Why are parasite contingency genes often associated with telomeres? |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |date=January 2003 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=29–45 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(02)00247-3 |pmid=12547344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the genes belonging to the ''var'' family in ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' (agent of malaria) are mostly localized in subtelomeric regions. Antigenic variation is orchestrated by epigenetic factors, including monoallelic var transcription at separate spatial domains at the nuclear periphery ([[nuclear pore]]), differential [[histone]] marks on otherwise identical var genes, and var [[Gene silencing|silencing]] mediated by telomeric [[heterochromatin]]. Other factors such as non-coding RNA produced in subtelomeric regions adjacent or within ''var'' genes may contribute as well to [[antigenic variation]].&lt;ref name="Scherf2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scherf |first1=Artur |last2=Lopez-Rubio |first2=Jose Juan |last3=Riviere |first3=Loïc |title=Antigenic Variation in Plasmodium falciparum |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |date=October 2008 |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=445–470 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.61.080706.093134 |pmid=18785843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guizetti2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guizetti |first1=Julien |last2=Scherf |first2=Artur |title=Silence, activate, poise and switch!

VSG expression is exclusively subtelomeric and occurs either by in situ activation of a silent VSG gene or by DNA rearrangement that inserts an internal silent copy of a VSG gene into an active telomeric expression site. To contrast with ''Plasmodium falciparum'', in ''Trypanosoma brucei'', antigenic variation is orchestrated by epigenetic and genetic factors.&lt;ref name="Cross2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cross |first1=George A. M. |title=Antigenic variation in trypansosomes: Secrets surface slowly |journal=BioEssays |date=April 1996 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=283–291 |doi=10.1002/bies.950180406 |pmid=8967896 |s2cid=37442327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudenko2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rudenko |first1=G. |title=The polymorphic telomeres of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |date=1 October 2000 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=536–540 |doi=10.1042/bst0280536 |pmid=11044370 |pmc=3375589 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'' major surface glycoprotein (MSG) gene family cause antigenic variation. MSG genes are like boxes at chromosome ends, and only the MSG gene at the unique [[locus (genetics)|locus]] UCS (upstream conserved sequence) is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Different MSG genes can occupy the expression site (UCS), suggesting that [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] can take a gene from a pool of silent donors and install it at the expression site, possibly via [[Chromosomal crossover|crossovers]], activating transcription of a new MSG gene, and changing the surface antigen of ''Pneumocystis jirovecii''. Switching at the expression site is probably facilitated by the subtelomeric locations of expressed and silent MSG genes. A second subtelomeric gene family, MSR, is not strictly regulated at the transcriptional level, but may contribute to phenotypic diversity. Antigenic variation in ''P. jirovecii'' is dominated by genetic regulation.&lt;ref name="Stringer2014"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-41566-1_5 |chapter=Pneumocystis carinii Subtelomeres |title=Subtelomeres |year=2014 |last1=Stringer |first1=James R. |pages=101–115 |isbn=978-3-642-41565-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stringer2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Portnoy |first1=D.

==Pathologic implication==
Loss of telomeric DNA through repeated cycles of cell division is associated with [[senescence]] or somatic cell aging.  In contrast, [[germ line]] and [[cancer]] cells possess an enzyme, [[telomerase]], which prevents telomere degradation and maintains telomere integrity, causing these types of cells to be very long-lived.

In humans, the role of subtelomere disorders is demonstrated in [[facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy]] (FSHD), [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[epilepsy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mefford |first=Heather C. |last2=Cook |first2=Joseph |last3=Gospe |first3=Sidney M. |date=Nov 19, 2012 |title=Epilepsy due to 20q13.33 subtelomere deletion masquerading as pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajmg.a.35633 |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |language=en |volume=158A |issue=12 |pages=3190–3195 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.35633 |via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and peculiar syndromic diseases ([[malformation]] and mental retardation). For example, FSHD is associated with a deletion in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q. A series of 10 to &gt;100 kb repeats is located in the normal 4q subtelomere, but FSHD patients have only 1–10 repeat units. This deletion is thought to cause disease owing to a position effect that influences the transcription of nearby genes, rather than through the loss of the repeat array itself.&lt;ref name=pmid11836503/&gt;

==Advantages and effects==
Subtelomeres are homologous to other subtelomeres that are located at different chromosomes and are a type of [[transposable element]], DNA segments that can move around the genome. Although subtelomeres are [[pseudogene]]s and do not code for protein, they provide an evolutionary advantage by diversifying genes. The duplication, recombination, and deletion of subtelomeres allow for the creation of new genes and new chromosomal properties.&lt;ref name=pmid11836503&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mefford |first1=Heather C. |last2=Trask |first2=Barbara J. |title=The complex structure and dynamic evolution of human subtelomeres |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=February 2002 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=91–102 |doi=10.1038/nrg727 |pmid=11836503 |s2cid=18918401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of subtelomeres have been studied in different species such as ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'',&lt;ref name=pmid11836503/&gt; ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'',&lt;ref name=pmid11836503/&gt; and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'',&lt;ref name=pmid11836503/&gt; since they have similar genetic elements to humans, not accounting for length and sequence.&lt;ref name=pmid11836503/&gt; Subtelomeres might have the same role in plants since the same advantage have been found in a common bean plant known as ''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Nicolas W.

However, the use of inter-chromosomal circularization engenders chromosome instability by creating two [[centromeres]] in a single chromosome, causing chromosomal breakage during mitosis. In response to this, the chromosome could induce centromere inactivation to impede the formation of two centromeres, but this would induce [[heterochromatin]] formation in centromeres. Heterochromatin can be deleterious if it gets into a location that it is not supposed to be in. Subtelomeres are responsible to block heterochromatin from getting into the [[euchromatin]] region. Subtelomeres can mitigate the effects of heterochromatin invasion, by distributing heterochromatin around the ends of the subtelomeres. Without subtelomeres, heterochromatin would spread around the region of subtelomeres, getting too close to important genes. At this distance, heterochromatin can silence genes that are nearby, resulting in a higher sensitivity to [[osmotic stress]].&lt;ref name=pmid28981863/&gt;

Subtelomeres carry out essential functions with [[Shugoshin protein]]. Shugoshin is a centromere protein for chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis. There are two types of Shugoshin protein: [[SGOL1]] and [[SGOL2]]. Sgo1 is only expressed in meiosis 1 for centromeric cohesion of the sister chromosomes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watanabe |first1=Yoshinori |title=Sister chromatid cohesion along arms and at centromeres |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=July 2005 |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=405–412 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2005.05.009 |pmid=15946764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Sgo2,  expressed in meiosis and mitosis, is responsible for the segregation of chromosomes at centromeres in the M phase. In fission yeast, Sgo2 is localized not only in centromeres, but also in subtelomeres. Sgo2 interacts with subtelomeres during interphase; middle of the G2 phase and plays a major role in forming "knob", which is a highly condensed chromatin body. Sgo2 remains in subtelomeres, whose cells lack telomere DNA. Sgo2 represses the expression of subtelomeric genes that is in a different pass-way from the [[H3K9me3]]- Swi6-mediated heterochromatin. Sgo2 has also repressive effects for timing of subtelomeres replication by suppressing Sld3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruck|first1=Irina|last2=Kaplan|first2=Daniel L.|date=6 November 2015|title=The Replication Initiation Protein Sld3/Treslin Orchestrates the Assembly of the Replication Fork Helicase during S Phase|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=290|issue=45|pages=27414–27424|doi=10.1074/jbc.M115.688424|pmc=4646389|pmid=26405041|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; a replication factor, at the start of the replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tashiro|first1=Sanki|last2=Handa|first2=Tetsuya|last3=Matsuda|first3=Atsushi|last4=Ban|first4=Takuto|last5=Takigawa|first5=Toru|last6=Miyasato|first6=Kazumi|last7=Ishii|first7=Kojiro|last8=Kugou|first8=Kazuto|last9=Ohta|first9=Kunihiro|last10=Hiraoka|first10=Yasushi|last11=Masukata|first11=Hisao|date=25 January 2016|title=Shugoshin forms a specialized chromatin domain at subtelomeres that regulates transcription and replication timing|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|issue=1|pages=10393|bibcode=2016NatCo...710393T|doi=10.1038/ncomms10393|pmc=4737732|pmid=26804021|last12=Kanoh|first12=Junko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Sgo2 regulate gene expressions and replication to ensure proper subtelomeric gene expression and replication timing.

==Analysis==
Subtelomere analysis, especially sequencing and profiling of patient subtelomeres, is difficult because of the repeated sequences, length of stretches, and lack of databases on the topic.

{{For|(two distinct) mathematical uses|algebraic variety|variety (universal algebra)}}
A '''subvariety''' (Latin: '''''subvarietas''''') in [[botanical nomenclature]] is a [[taxonomic rank]]. They are rarely used to classify organisms.

==Plant taxonomy==
Subvariety is ranked: 
*below that of [[Variety (biology)|variety]] (''varietas'')
*above that of [[Form (botany)|form]] (''forma'').

Subvariety is an [[infraspecific taxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|date=2012|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art4 |chapter= Article 4|quote=4.1. If a greater number of ranks of taxa is desired, [...a]n organism may thus be assigned to taxa of the following ranks (in descending sequence): [... genus, ... species, subspecies,] variety ({{lang|la|varietas}}), subvariety ({{lang|la|subvarietas}}), form ({{lang|la|forma}}), and subform ({{lang|la|subforma}}). ... 4.3. Further ranks may also be intercalated or added, provided that confusion or error is not thereby introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
Its name consists of three parts: 
#a genus name (genera)
#a specific epithet (species)
#an infraspecific epithet  (subvariety)

To indicate the subvariety rank, the abbreviation '''"subvar."''' is put before the infraspecific epithet.

A '''superorganism''' or '''supraorganism'''&lt;ref&gt;Lüttge, Ulrich (ed.); Cánovas, Francisco M. (ed.); Matyssek, Rainer (ed.). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mNBDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223 Progress in Botany 77]. Springer, 2016, p. 223. “Note that etymologically, the Latin word ‘supra’ means ‘higher’ in the sense of ordination, whereas ‘super’ implies a spatial order. Thus, in contrast to the mainly used notion of ‘superorganism’, we prefer to stay with the notion of a ‘supraorganism’.”&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of [[Synergy|synergetically]] interacting organisms of the same [[species]]. A [[Community (ecology)|community]] of synergetically interacting organisms of different species is called a [[holobiont]].

==Concept==

The term superorganism is used most often to describe a [[social unit]] of [[eusociality|eusocial]] animals, where [[division of labour]] is highly specialised and where individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods.  [[Ants]] are the best-known example of such a superorganism. A superorganism can be defined as "a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outofcontrolnewb00kell/page/98 98] |isbn=978-0-201-48340-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/outofcontrolnewb00kell/page/98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; phenomena being any activity "the hive wants" such as ants collecting food and [[antipredator adaptation|avoiding predators]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Deneubourg JL, etal | year=1989 |title=The Self-Organizing Exploratory Pattern of the Argentine Ant |journal=[[Journal of Lnsect Behavior]] |volume=3 | issue=2 |pages=159–168 |doi=10.1007/BF01417909| citeseerx=10.1.1.382.9846 | s2cid=18862040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=O'Shea-Wheller TA, etal | year=2015 |title=Differentiated Anti-Predation Responses in a Superorganism|journal=[[PLOS One]] |volume=10 | issue=11 |page=e0141012 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141012| pmid=26558385 | pmc=4641648 | bibcode=2015PLoSO..1041012O | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; or bees choosing a new nest site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Britton NF, etal | year=2002 |title=Deciding on a new home: how do honeybees agree?|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=269 | issue=1498 |pages=1383–1388 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2001| pmid=12079662 |pmc=1691030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In challenging environments, micro organisms collaborate and evolve together to process unlikely sources of nutrients such as methane. This process called [[syntrophy]] ("eating together") might be linked to the evolution of eukaryote cells and involved in the emergence or maintenance of life forms in challenging environments on Earth and possibly other planets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/superorganisms/|title = The Search for Superorganisms}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superorganisms tend to exhibit [[homeostasis]], [[power law]] scaling, persistent disequilibrium and emergent behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://longnow.org/seminars/02014/nov/12/technium-unbound/ Technium Unbound, SALT The Long Now Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1789 by [[James Hutton]], the "father of geology", to refer to [[Earth]] in the context of [[geophysiology]]. The [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth'', James Lovelock, Oxford University Press, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lynn Margulis]] as well as the work of Hutton, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] and [[Guy Murchie]], have suggested that the [[biosphere]] itself can be considered a superorganism, although this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |date=2013|title=On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view relates to [[systems theory]] and the dynamics of a [[complex system]].

The concept of a superorganism raises the question of what is to be considered an [[Individualism|individual]]. Toby Tyrrell's critique of the Gaia hypothesis argues that Earth's climate system does not resemble an animal's physiological system. Planetary biospheres are not tightly regulated in the same way that animal bodies are: "planets, unlike animals, are not products of evolution. Therefore we are entitled to be highly skeptical (or even outright dismissive) about whether to expect something akin to a 'superorganism'". He concludes that "the superorganism analogy is unwarranted".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In social theory ==

The nineteenth century thinker [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the term ''super-organic'' to focus on social organization (the first chapter of his ''Principles of [[Sociology]]'' is entitled "Super-organic Evolution"&lt;ref&gt;''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 1. "The Data of Sociology", Herbert Spencer, 1876&lt;/ref&gt;), though this was apparently a distinction between the organic and the social, ''not'' an identity: Spencer explored the [[holism in science|holistic]] nature of society as a [[social organism]] while distinguishing the ways in which society did not behave like an organism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 2, Chapter II, "A Society Is an Organism" (sections 222 and 223), Herbert Spencer, 1876&lt;/ref&gt; For Spencer, the super-organic was an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of interacting organisms, that is, human beings. And, as has been argued by D. C. Phillips, there is a "difference between emergence and reductionism".&lt;ref&gt;''Holistic Thought in Social Science'', D. C. Phillips, Stanford University Press, 1976, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[Carl Menger]] expanded upon the evolutionary nature of much social growth, but without ever abandoning [[methodological individualism]]. Many social institutions arose, Menger argued, not as "the result of socially teleological causes, but the unintended result of innumerable efforts of economic subjects pursuing 'individual' interests".&lt;ref&gt;''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', Carl Menger, Louis Schneider (translator), New York University Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer and Menger both argued that because it is individuals who choose and act, any social whole should be considered less than an organism, though Menger emphasized this more emphatically. Spencer used the {{not a typo|organistic}} idea to engage in extended analysis of [[social structure]], conceding that it was primarily an analogy. So, for Spencer, the idea of the super-organic best designated a distinct level of [[social reality]] above that of biology and psychology, and not a one-to-one identity with an organism. Nevertheless, Spencer maintained that "every organism of appreciable size is a society", which has suggested to some that the issue may be terminological.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Philosophy of Herbert Spencer'', Tim S. Gray, 1996, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''superorganic'' was adopted by the  anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns of Culture'', Ruth Benedict, Houghton Mifflin, 1934, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  Social aspects of the superorganism concept are analysed by [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]] in his 2002 book "The Unity of Nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p268|doi=10.1142/p268|title=The Unity of Nature|year=2002|last1=Marshall|first1=Alan|isbn=978-1-86094-330-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, recent work in social psychology has offered the superorganism metaphor as a unifying framework to understand diverse aspects of human sociality, such as religion, conformity, and social identity processes.&lt;ref&gt;Kesebir, Selin. ''[https://ssrn.com/abstract=1933734 The Superorganism Account of Human Sociality: How and When Human Groups are Like Beehives]''. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2012, 16, 233-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cybernetics==

Superorganisms are important in [[cybernetics]], particularly [[biocybernetics]]. They are capable of the so-called "[[Collective intelligence|distributed intelligence]]", which is a system composed of individual agents that have limited intelligence and information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These are able to pool resources so that they are able to complete goals that are beyond reach of the individuals on their own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Existence of such [[behavior]] in organisms has many implications for military and management applications, and is being actively researched.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |page=[https://archive.org/details/outofcontrolnewb00kell/page/251 251] |isbn=978-0-201-48340-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/outofcontrolnewb00kell/page/251 }}&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If Col. Thorpe [of the US [[DARPA]]] has his way, the four divisions of the US military and hundreds of industrial subcontractors will become a single interconnected superorganism. The immediate step to this world of distributed intelligence is an engineering protocol developed by a consortium of defense simulation centers in Orlando Florida ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Superorganisms are also considered dependent upon cybernetic governance and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Systems and Cybernetics, Second edition|last=François|first=Charles|date=2004|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3598116306|location=Munchen|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the idea that a biological system – in order to be effective – needs a sub-system of cybernetic communications and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synergistic Selection: How Cooperation Has Shaped Evolution And The Rise Of Humankind|last=A|first=Corning Peter|date=2017|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9813230934|location=Hackensack, NJ|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is demonstrated in the way a mole rat colony uses functional synergy and cybernetic processes together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics, and the Bioeconomics of Evolution|last=Corning|first=Peter|date=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226116136|location=Chicago|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joël de Rosnay|Joel de Rosnay]] also introduced a concept called "cybionte" to describe cybernetic superorganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology and the Internet: Intrapersonal, Interpersonal, and Transpersonal Implications|last=Gackenbach|first=Jayne|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0123694256|location=Amsterdam|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion associate superorganism with [[chaos theory]], multimedia technology, and other new developments.

'''Subtractive hybridization''' is a technology that allows for [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR-based]] amplification of only [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] fragments that differ between a control (driver) and experimental [[transcriptome]]. cDNA is produced from [[Messenger_RNA|mRNA]].  Differences in relative abundance of transcripts are highlighted, as are genetic differences between species.  The technique relies on the removal of dsDNA formed by hybridization between a control and test sample, thus eliminating cDNAs or [[gDNA]]s of similar abundance, and retaining differentially expressed, or variable in sequence, transcripts or genomic sequences.

Suppression subtractive hybridization has also been successfully used to identify strain- or species-specific DNA sequences in a variety of bacteria including ''Vibrio'' species ([[Metagenomics]]).

      <text bytes="11977" xml:space="preserve">[[Surface tension]] is one of the areas of interest in [[biomimetics]] research. Surface tension forces will only begin to dominate gravitational forces below length scales on the order of the fluid's [[capillary length]], which for water is about 2 millimeters. Because of this scaling, biomimetic devices that utilize surface tension will generally be very small, however there are many ways in which such devices could be used.

[[File:Lotus Leaf (5780807820).jpg|thumb|Lotus Leaf (5780807820)]] [[File:Unitary roughness structure versus hierarchical structure.jpg|thumb|Unitary roughness structure versus hierarchical structure]]

A [[:File:Lotus Leaf (5780807820).jpg|lotus leaf]] is well known for its ability to repel water and self-clean. Yuan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yuan|first1=Zhiqing|title=A novel fabrication of a superhydrophobic surface with highly similar hierarchical structure of the lotus leaf on a copper sheet|journal=Applied Surface Science|date=15 November 2013|volume= 285|pages=205–210|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.08.037|bibcode=2013ApSS..285..205Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues fabricated a negative mold of alotus leaf from [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) to capture the tiny [[:File:Unitary roughness structure versus hierarchical structure.jpg|hierarchical structures]] integral for the leaf's ability to repel water, known as the [[lotus effect]]. The lotus leaf's surface was then replicated by allowing a copper sheet to flow into the negative mold with the assistance of [[Iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] and pressure. The result was a lotus leaf-like surface inherent on the copper sheet. Static water [[contact angle]] measurements of the biomimetic surface were taken to be 132° after etching the copper and 153° after a [[stearic acid]] surface treatment to mimic the lotus leaf's waxy coating. A surface that mimics the lotus leaf could have numerous applications by providing water repellent outdoor gear.

Various species of [[Salvinia natans|floating fern]] are able to sustain a liquid-solid barrier of air between the fern and the surrounding water when they are submerged. Like the lotus leaf, floating fern species have tiny hierarchical structures that prevent water from wetting the plant surface. Mayser and Barthlott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayser|first1=Matthias|title=Layers of Air in the Water beneath the Floating Fern Salvinia are Exposed to Fluctuations in Pressure|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=12 June 2014|volume= 56|issue= 5|pages=1000–7000|doi=10.1093/icb/icu072 |pmid=24925548|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated this ability by submerging different species of the floating fern salvinia in water inside a pressure vessel to study how the air barrier between the leaf and surrounding water react to changes in pressure that would be similar to those experienced by the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of a ship. Much other research is ongoing using these hierarchical structures in coatings on ship hulls to reduce viscous [[Drag (physics)|drag]] effects.

[[File:Bronchial anatomy.jpg|thumb|Bronchial anatomy]]

A lung is composed of many small sacks called [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse in and out of the blood respectively as the blood is passed through small capillaries that surround these alveoli. Surface tension is exploited by alveoli by means of a [[surfactant]] that is produced by one of the cells and released to lower the surface tension of the fluid coating the inside of the alveoli to prevent these sacks from collapsing. Huh &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huh|first1=Dongeun|title=Reconstituting Organ-Level Lung Functions on a Chip|journal=Science|date=25 June 2010|volume= 328|issue= 5986|pages=1662–1668|doi=10.1126/science.1188302|pmid=20576885|pmc=8335790|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1662H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his fellow researchers created a lung mimic that replicated the function of native [[alveolar cells]]. An [[extracellular matrix]] of gel, human alveolar epithelial cells, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were cultured on a polydimethylsiloxane membrane that was bound in a flexible vacuum diaphragm. Pressurization cycles of the vacuum diaphragm, which simulated breathing, showed similar form and function to an actual lung. The type II cells were also shown to emit the same surfactant that lowered the surface tension of the fluid coating the lung mimic. This research will hopefully some day lead to the creation of lungs that could be grown for patients that need to have a transplant or repair performed.

=== Locomotion ===

[[Microvelia]] exploit surface tension by creating a surface tension gradient that propels them forward by releasing a surfactant behind them through a tongue-like protrusion. Biomimetic engineering was used in a creative and fun way to make and edible [[cocktail]] boat that mimicked the ability of microvelia to propel themselves on the surface of water by means of a phenomenon called the [[marangoni effect]].  Burton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=Lisa|title=The Cocktail Boat|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=22 May 2014|volume= 54|issue= 6|pages=969–973|doi=10.1093/icb/icu052|pmid=24853727|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her colleagues used [[3D printing]] to make small plastic boats that released different types of [[alcohol (chemistry)|alcohol]]s behind the boat to lower the surface tension and create a surface tension gradient that propelled each boat. This type of propulsion could one day be used to make sea vessels more efficient.

=== Actuators ===

[[File:Polypody (a fern) - the underside - geograph.org.uk - 974672.jpg|thumb|Polypody (a fern) - the underside - geograph.org.uk - 974672]] [[File:Image from page 395 of "The structure and development of mosses and ferns (Archegoniatae)" (1918) (14598564448).jpg|thumb|Image from page 395 of "The structure and development of mosses and ferns (Archegoniatae)" (1918) (14598564448)]]

Fern [[Sporangium|sporangia]] consist of hygroscopic ribs that protrude from a spine on the part of the plant that encapsulate spores in a sack ([[:File:Image from page 395 of "The structure and development of mosses and ferns (Archegoniatae)" (1918) (14598564448).jpg|diagram]]). A [[Capillary bridges|capillary bridge]] is formed when water condenses on to the surface of these spines. When this water evaporates, surface tension forces between each rib cause the spine to retract and rip open the sack, spilling the spores. Borno &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borno|first1=Ruba|title=Transpiration actuation: the design, fabrication and characterization of biomimetic microactuators driven by the surface tension of water|journal=Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering|date=21 September 2006|volume= 16|issue= 11|pages=2375–2383|doi=10.1088/0960-1317/16/11/018|bibcode=2006JMiMi..16.2375B|hdl=2027.42/49048|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her fellow researchers fabricated a biomimetic device from polydimethylsiloxane using standard [[photolithography]] techniques. The devices used the same hygroscopic ribs and spine that resemble fern sporangia. The researchers varied the dimensions and spacing of the features of the device and were able to fine-tune and predict movements of the device as a whole in hopes of using a similar device as a microactuator that can perform functions using free energy from a humid atmosphere.

[[File:Leaf Beetle (Gastrophysa viridula) - male.jpg|thumb|Leaf Beetle (Gastrophysa viridula) - male]]

A [[leaf beetle]] has an incredible ability to adhere to dry surfaces by using numerous capillary bridges between the tiny hair-like [[seta]]e on its feet. Vogel and Steen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Michael|title=Capillarity-based switchable adhesion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=22 December 2009|volume= 107|issue= 8|pages=3377–3381|doi=10.1073/pnas.0914720107|pmid=20133725|pmc=2840443|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted this and designed and constructed a switchable wet adhesion mechanism that mimics this ability. They used standard photolithography techniques to fabricate a switchable adhesion [[Robot end effector|gripper]] that used a pump driven by [[electro-osmosis]] to create many capillary bridges that would hold on to just about any surface. The leaf beetle can also reverse this effect by trapping air bubbles between its setae to walk on wet surfaces or under water. This effect was demonstrated by Hosoda and Gorb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hosoda|first1=N.|title=How a leaf beetle walks underwater|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120808132526.htm|website=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they constructed a biomimetic surface that could adhere objects to surfaces under water. Using this technology could help to create autonomous robots that would be able to explore treacherous terrain that is otherwise too dangerous to explore.

[[File:Water strider, from Kerala.JPG|thumb|Water strider, from Kerala]]

Various life forms found in nature exploit surface tension in different ways. Hu &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=David|title=Water-walking devices|journal=Experiments in Fluids|date=1 June 2007|volume= 43|issue= 5|pages=769–778|doi=10.1007/s00348-007-0339-6|bibcode=2007ExFl...43..769H|s2cid=12754027}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues looked at a few examples to create devices that mimic the abilities of their natural counterparts to walk on water, jump off the liquid interface, and climb [[Meniscus (liquid)|menisci]]. Two such devices were a rendition of the [[Gerridae|water strider]]. Both devices mimicked the form and function of a water strider by incorporating a rowing motion of one pair of legs to propel the device, however one was powered with elastic energy and the other was powered by electrical energy. This research compared the various biomimetic devices to their natural counterparts by showing the difference between many physical and [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless parameters]]. This research could one day lead to small, energy efficient water walking robots that could be used to clean up spills in waterways.

=== Environment ===

[[File:Stenocara dentata.jpg|thumb|stenocara dentata]]

The [[Stenocara dentata|Stenocara beetle]], a native of the [[Namib Desert]] has a unique structure on its body that allows it to capture water from a humid atmosphere. In the Namib Desert, rain is not a very common occurrence, but on some mornings a dense fog will roll over the desert. The stenocara beetle uses tiny raised [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] spots on its hydrophobic body to collect water droplets from the fog. Once these droplets are large enough, they can detach from these spots and roll down the beetle's back and into its mouth. Garrod et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrod|first1=R.|title=Mimicking a Stenocara Beetle's Back for Microcondensation Using Plasmachemical Patterned Superhydrophobic-Superhydrophilic Surfaces|journal=Langmuir|date=4 October 2006|volume= 23|issue= 2|pages=689–693|doi=10.1021/la0610856|pmid=17209621}}&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated a biomimetic surface that was created using standard photolithography and plasma etching to create hydrophilic spots on a hydrophobic substrate for water collection. The optimal sizing and spacing of these spots that allowed the most water to be collected was similar to the spacing of the spots on the body of the stenocara beetle. Currently, this surface technology is being studied to implement as a coating on the inside of a water bottle the will allow the water bottle to self fill if left open in a humid environment, and could help to provide aid where water is scarce.

'''Surfactants''' are [[chemical compounds]] that decrease the [[surface tension]] between two [[liquid]]s, between a [[gas]] and a liquid, or [[interfacial tension]] between a liquid and a [[solid]]. Surfactants may act as [[detergent]]s, [[wetting]] agents, [[emulsion#Emulsifiers |emulsifiers]], [[foaming agent]]s, or [[dispersant]]s.
The word "surfactant" is a [[Blend word|blend]] of '''''surf'''ace-'''act'''ive '''a'''ge'''nt''''',&lt;ref name="Rosen MJ"&gt;

coined {{circa | 1950}}.&lt;ref&gt;
{{oed | surfactant}} – "A new word, Surfactants, has been coined by Antara Products, General Aniline &amp; Film Corporation, and has been presented to the chemical industry to cover all materials that have surface activity, including wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, detergents and foaming agents."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Agents that increase surface tension are "surface active" in the literal sense but are not called surfactants as their effect is opposite to the common meaning. A common example of surface tension increase is [[salting out]]: by adding an inorganic salt to an aqueous solution of a weakly polar substance, the substance will precipitate. The substance may itself be a surfactant – this is one  of the reasons why many surfactants are ineffective in sea water.

==Composition and structure==

[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] "heads" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets ("emulsion breaking") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of [[aprotic]] solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date= February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]

Surfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning each molecule contains both a [[hydrophilic]] "water-seeking" group (the ''head''), and a [[hydrophobic]] "water-avoiding" group (the ''tail'').&lt;ref name="The Lipid Chronicles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, a surfactant contains both a water-soluble component and a water-insoluble component. Surfactants diffuse in water and get [[Adsorption|adsorb]]ed at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water, or at the interface between oil and water in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase. 

The hydrophobic tail may be either [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] ("oil-seeking") or [[lipophobicity|lipophobic]] ("oil-avoiding") depending on its chemistry. [[Hydrocarbon]] groups are usually lipophilic, for use in soaps and detergents, while [[fluorocarbon]] groups are lipophobic, for use in [[Stain repellent|repelling stains]] or reducing surface tension.

World production of surfactants is estimated at 15 million tons per year, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1.7 million tons/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600,000 tons/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700,000 tons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500,000 tons/y).&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Kurt Kosswig "Surfactants" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure of surfactant phases in water===
{{main|Wetting solution}}
In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB). Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].

===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===
The dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of absorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be ‘kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to [[Steric repulsion|steric]] or [[Electrostatic repulsion|electrostatic repulsions]].
The [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.

===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===
Interfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the
-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].
Dynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]

The structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or [[X-ray reflectivity]].

Surface rheology can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.

==In biology==
{{further|Pulmonary surfactant}}
[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant. Shown in {{color|#800000|red}} – [[choline]] and [[phosphate]] group; {{color|#000000|black}} – [[glycerol]]; {{color|#008000|green}} – [[monounsaturated fatty acid]]; {{color|#000080|blue}} – [[saturated fatty acid]].]]

The human body produces diverse surfactants. [[Pulmonary surfactant]] is produced in the [[lung]]s in order to facilitate breathing by increasing [[total lung capacity]], and [[lung compliance]]. In [[Respiratory distress syndrome, adult|respiratory distress syndrome]] or RDS, [[Pulmonary surfactant (medication)|surfactant replacement]] therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One example of a pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactant is Survanta ([[beractant]]) or its generic form Beraksurf, produced by [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] and [[Tekzima]] respectively. [[Bile salts]], a surfactant produced in the liver, play an important role in digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2010.12.002|pmid=21236400|title=The role of bile salts in digestion|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=165|issue=1|pages=36–46|year=2011|last1=Maldonado-Valderrama|first1=Julia|last2=Wilde|first2=Pete|last3=MacIerzanka|first3=Adam|last4=MacKie|first4=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety and environmental risks ==
Most anionic and non-ionic surfactants are non-toxic, having [[LD50]] comparable to [[nacl|table salt]]. The toxicity of [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compounds]], which are [[antibacterial]] and [[antifungal]], varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low LD50 (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Anionic surfactants can be found in soils as the result of [[sewage sludge]] application, wastewater irrigation, and remediation processes.

In the case of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], unprecedented amounts of [[Corexit]] were sprayed directly into the ocean at the leak and on the sea-water's surface.  The apparent theory was that the surfactants isolate droplets of oil, making it easier for petroleum-consuming microbes to digest the oil.  The active ingredient in Corexit is [[dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate]] (DOSS), [[sorbitan monooleate]] (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monooleate ([[Polysorbate 80|Tween-80]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emsa.europa.eu/opr-documents/opr-manual-a-guidelines/download/1166/719/23.html |title=European Maritime Safety Agency.

===Biodegradation===
Because of the volume of surfactants released into the environment, their biodegradation is of great interest. Strategies to enhance degradation include [[ozone]] treatment and biodegradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10311-014-0466-2|title=Surfactants: Toxicity, remediation and green surfactants|year=2014|last1=Rebello|first1=Sharrel|last2=Asok|first2=Aju K.|last3=Mundayoor|first3=Sathish|last4=Jisha|first4=M.

Attracting much attention is the non-biodegradability of [[fluorosurfactant]], e.g. [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA).&lt;ref&gt;USEPA: [http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/pfoa/pubs/pfoastewardship.htm "2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027061359/http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/pfoa/pubs/pfoastewardship.htm |date=27 October 2008 }} Accessed October 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The annual global production of surfactants was 13 million tons in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Market Report: World Surfactant Market | publisher = Acmite Market Intelligence | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/chemicals/world-surfactant-market.html | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100913183019/http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/chemicals/world-surfactant-market.html | archive-date = 13 September 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the world market for surfactants reached a volume of more than US $33 billion. Market researchers expect annual revenues to increase by 2.5% per year to around $40.4 billion until 2022. The commercially most significant type of surfactants is currently the anionic surfactant LAS, which is widely used in cleaners and detergents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/surfactants Market Study on Surfactants (2nd edition, April 2015), by Ceresana Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320205205/http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/surfactants/ |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Surfactants play an important role as cleaning, [[wetting]], [[Dispersant|dispersing]], [[Emulsifier|emulsifying]], [[foaming agent|foaming]] and [[Defoamer|anti-foaming]] agents in many practical applications and products, including [[detergent]]s, [[fabric softener]]s, [[motor oil]]s, [[emulsion]]s, [[soap]]s, [[paint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, [[ink]]s, [[anti-fog]]s, [[ski wax]]es, snowboard wax, [[deinking]] of [[recycled paper]]s, in flotation, washing and enzymatic processes, and [[laxative]]s. Also agrochemical formulations such as [[herbicide]]s (some), [[insecticide]]s, [[biocide]]s (sanitizers), and [[spermicide]]s ([[nonoxynol-9]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2007.11.001|title=Surfactant-enhanced remediation of organic contaminated soil and water|year=2008|last1=Paria|first1=Santanu|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=138|issue=1|pages=24–58|pmid=18154747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal care products such as [[cosmetics]], [[shampoo]]s, [[shower gel]], [[hair conditioner]]s, and [[toothpaste]]s. Surfactants are used in [[firefighting]] and pipelines (liquid drag reducing agents). Alkali surfactant polymers are used to mobilize oil in [[oil well]]s.

Surfactants act to cause the displacement of air from the matrix of cotton pads and bandages so that medicinal solutions can be absorbed for application to various body areas. They also act to displace dirt and debris by the use of detergents in the washing of wounds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Percival|first1=S.l.|last2=Mayer|first2=D.|last3=Malone|first3=M.|last4=Swanson|first4=T|last5=Gibson|first5=D.|last6=Schultz|first6=G.|date=2017-11-02|title=Surfactants and their role in wound cleansing and biofilm management|journal=Journal of Wound Care|volume=26|issue=11|pages=680–690|doi=10.12968/jowc.2017.26.11.680|pmid=29131752|issn=0969-0700}}&lt;/ref&gt; and via the application of medicinal lotions and sprays to surface of skin and mucous membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mc Callion|first1=O.

===Detergents in biochemistry and biotechnology===
In solution, detergents help solubilize a variety of chemical species by dissociating aggregates and unfolding proteins.  Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's [[lipid bilayer]] (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].

Detergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&amp;nbsp;– NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805083144/http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|archive-date=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in [[mammals]].

=== Heterogeneous catalysis ===
Janus-type material is used as a surfactant-like heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of adipic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Vafaeezadeh |first=Majid |last2=Wilhelm |first2=Christian |last3=Breuninger |first3=Paul |last4=Ernst |first4=Stefan |last5=Antonyuk |first5=Sergiy |last6=Thiel |first6=Werner R. |date=2020-05-20 |title=A Janus‐type Heterogeneous Surfactant for Adipic Acid Synthesis |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cctc.202000140 |journal=ChemCatChem |language=en |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=2695–2701 |doi=10.1002/cctc.202000140 |issn=1867-3880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The "tails" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.

Many important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.

Surfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.

[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]

Most commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:

===&lt;span class="anchor" id="Anionic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives===
[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.
Prominent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].

Others include:
*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) 
*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)
*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]
* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates
* Alkyl ether phosphates

Carboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).

===Cationic head groups===
pH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH &lt; 10:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].

Permanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).

===Zwitterionic surfactants===
[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.

[[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]] and [[myristamine oxide]] are two commonly used zwitterionic surfactants of the tertiary [[amine oxide]]s structural type.

=== Non-ionic ===

Non-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Surfactant Classification {{!}} Types of Surfactants {{!}} Uses of Surfactants |url=https://www.esteem-india.com/What-makes-a-surfactant.php |access-date=2022-10-09 |website=www.esteem-india.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.

Non-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

[[File:Clerck1757-title-page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the 1757 edition of ''Svenska Spindlar'']]

The book '''''{{Lang|sv|Svenska Spindlar}}''''' or '''''{{lang|la|Aranei Svecici}}''''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Latin]], respectively, for "Swedish spiders") is one of the major works of the Swedish arachnologist and entomologist [[Carl Alexander Clerck]] and was first published in Stockholm in the year 1757. It was the first comprehensive book on the spiders of Sweden and one of the first regional monographs of a group of animals worldwide. The full title of the work is ''{{lang|sv|Svenska Spindlar uti sina hufvud-slägter indelte samt under några och sextio särskildte arter beskrefne och med illuminerade figurer uplyste}} – {{lang|la|Aranei Svecici, descriptionibus et figuris æneis illustrati, ad genera subalterna redacti, speciebus ultra LX determinati}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN367246287 |author=C.

It was published in Swedish, with a Latin translation printed in a slightly smaller font below the Swedish text.

Clerck described in detail 67 species of Swedish spiders,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/list/taxa?from_reference=1 AnimalBase list] of all 67 names of species established by Clerck 1757.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first time in a zoological work consistently applied [[binomial nomenclature]] as proposed by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Linnaeus had originally invented this system for botanical names in his 1753 work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', and presented it again in 1758 in the 10th edition of his work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' for more than 4,000 animal species. ''Svenska Spindlar'' is the only pre-Linnaean source to be recognised as a taxonomic authority for such names.

Clerck explained in the last (9th of the 2nd part) chapter of his work that in contrast to previous authors he used the term "spider" in the strict sense, for animals possessing eight eyes and separated [[prosoma]] and [[opisthosoma]], and that his concept of this group of animals did not include [[Opiliones]] (because they had two eyes and a broadly joined prosoma and opisthosoma) and other groups of [[arachnids]].

For all spiders Clerck used a single generic name (''[[Araneus]]''), to which was added a specific name which consisted of only one word. Each species was presented in the Swedish text with their Latin scientific names,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/16922815 |chapter=Introduction |title=Descriptive Catalogue of the Spiders of Burma based upon the Collection made by Eugene W. Oates and Preserved in the British Museum |publisher=[[British Museum (Natural History)]] |author=Eugene William Oates &amp; Tord Thorell |year=1895 |page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by detailed information containing the exact dates when he had found the animals, and a detailed description of eyes, legs and body. The differences between the sexes were also described. Each species was illustrated in impressively accurate drawings printed on coloured copper plates which were bound at the end of the volume.

==Impact and importance of the work ==
Because of the exceptionally thorough treatment of the spider species, the scientific names proposed by Clerck (which were adopted by Carl Linnaeus in his ''Systema Naturae'' in 1758 with only minor modifications) had traditionally been recognized by arachnologists as [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] and available. In 1959 the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN Commission]] decided that Clerck's work should be available for zoological nomenclature,&lt;ref name="Dir104"&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |author-link=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1959 |title=Direction 104. Grant of the status of availability to the names published by C. A. Clerck in 1757 in the work ''Aranei Svecici'' and addition of the title of that work to the Official List of Works approved as available for use in Zoological Nomenclature |journal=[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]] |volume=17 |issue=3–5 |pages=89–91 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44459#page/111/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] did not mention Clerck's work.{{#tag:ref|The third edition of the ICZN Code (1960) restricted binomial publications to works after 1757.|group=Note}} Only after 1999 was this officially recognized in the Code.&lt;ref name="Art3.1"&gt;{{cite book |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |author-link=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] |edition=4th |isbn=0-85301-006-4 |chapter=Article 3.1 |chapter-url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=3&amp;nfv= |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that in case of doubt the spelling of a spider name as from Clerck's 1757 work has priority over that proposed by Linnaeus in 1758 (an example is ''Araneus'' instead of ''Aranea''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/11534193 |chapter=Rules of Nomenclature in Zoology |title=Natural Science |volume=8 |publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co |year=1896 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Clerck's spiders were the first animals in modern zoology to have obtained an available scientific name in the Linnean system.&lt;ref name="Art3.1"/&gt;

== Year 1757 or 1758? ==
In the late 1800s, Clerck's 1757 work was commonly accepted as the first application of binomial nomenclature to spiders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/110354#page/75/mode/1up Transactions of the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne], Volume 13, Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club, 1896, Pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the ICZN Commission ruled that the date 1758 should be used for Clerck's names,&lt;ref name="Dir104"/&gt; this date 1758 was repeated to apply to Clerck's names in the 4th edition of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Art3.1"/&gt;

In a complete binomial name with author and year, the year corresponds to the year of publication of the original source. Since 2000, the ICZN Code includes an exception of this very basic rule.&lt;ref name="Art21.1"&gt;{{cite book |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |author-link=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] |edition=4th |isbn=0-85301-006-4 |chapter=Article 21.1 |chapter-url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=21&amp;nfv= |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning on the new provision in the Code has been misunderstood by many researchers who believed that by setting the date for Clerck's work to 1758 (overriding its true date 1757) and the date for ''Systema Naturae'' to 1 January 1758, the priority was changed. In 2007, a case was even brought before the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|Commission]] because the researchers were no longer sure whether the generic name should be ''[[Araneus]]'' &lt;small&gt;Clerck&lt;/small&gt; or ''Aranea'' &lt;small&gt;Linnaeus&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=N. J. Kluge |year=2007 |title=Case 3371.

In 2009 the Commission saw itself forced to repeat once more, although this was already explicit in the Code's Article 3.1, that the name ''Araneus'' established by Clerck shall have priority and be used for the genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |author-link=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=2009 |title=Opinion 2224 (Case 3371) Araneidae Clerck, 1758, ''Araneus'' Clerck, 1758 and ''Tegenaria'' Latreille, 1804 (Arachnida, Araneae): proposed conservation |url=http://iczn.org/content/opinion-2224-case-3371-araneidae-clerck-1758-araneus-clerck-1758-and-tegenaria-latreille-180 |url-status=dead |journal=[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=192–193 |doi=10.21805/bzn.v66i2.a9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314094841/https://www.iczn.org/content/opinion-2224-case-3371-araneidae-clerck-1758-araneus-clerck-1758-and-tegenaria-latreille-180 |archive-date=2016-03-14 |s2cid=83789938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3692" xml:space="preserve">[[Mutualism (biology)|Symbiosis (mutualism)]] appears in fiction, especially [[science fiction]], as a plot device. It is distinguished from [[parasitism in fiction]], a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the [[parasite]] inflicts harm on its host.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |title=Parasitism and Symbiosis |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/parasitism_and_symbiosis |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |access-date=25 July 2018 |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
{{further|Parasitism in fiction|Human possession in science fiction}}

Relationships between species in early [[science fiction]] were often [[parasitism in fiction|imaginatively parasitic]], with the [[parasite]]s draining the [[Élan vital|vital energy]] of their human hosts and taking over their minds, as in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1895 ''[[The Parasite]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]]'s 1970 ''By Furies Possessed''; [[Brian Stableford]] argues that White was consciously opposing the [[xenophobia]] of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1951 ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'' which involved a parasitic relationship close to [[demonic possession]], with a more positive attitude towards aliens.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Stableford notes, however, that [[Octavia Butler]]'s 1984 ''[[Clay's Ark]]'' and other of her works such as ''[[Fledgling (Butler novel)|Fledgling]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez-Taylor |first1=Joy |title=Fledgling, Symbiosis, and the Nature/Culture Divide |journal=Science Fiction Studies |date=November 2017 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=486-505 |doi=10.5621/sciefictstud.44.3.0486}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dan Simmons]]'s 1989 ''Hyperion'' take an ambivalent position, in which the aliens may confer powers such as ''Hyperion'''s ability to regenerate continually—but at a price, in its case an incremental loss of intelligence at each regeneration.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

In [[Star Trek]], the [[Dax (Star Trek)|Trill]] were a race of humanoids who incorporated a long-living symbiont. One of them was a main character on the series [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]].

In the series [[Stargate SG-1]], both the principal villains, the [[Goa'uld]] and their benevolent versions, the [[Tok'ra]] were symbionts who grafted themselves into the human nervous system.

[[The Force]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe is described by the fictional seer [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as "an energy field created by all living things". In ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, inside all living cells, allow characters with enough of these symbionts in their cells to feel and use the Force.&lt;ref name="BrooksEpisodeI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace |last=Brooks |first=Terry |author-link=Terry Brooks |date=1999 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Douglas Adams]]'s humorous 1978 ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the Babel fish lives in its human host's ear, feeding on the energy of its host's brain waves, in return translating any language to the host's benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: Fit the First'' BBC Radio 4 program, broadcast 8 March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ultraman]] series, the titular aliens take human bodies to rest in and hide among society, while the hosts gain inhuman levels of speed and strength.

'''Synbiotics''' refer to [[food ingredient]]s or [[dietary supplement]]s combining [[probiotic]]s and [[prebiotics]] in a form of [[Synergy|synergism]], hence synbiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26604335 | doi=10.1007/s13197-015-1921-1 | volume=52 | issue=12 | title=Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics – a review | year=2015 | journal=J Food Sci Technol | pages=7577–87 | vauthors=Pandey KR, Naik SR, Vakil BV|pmc=4648921}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synbiotic concept was first introduced as "mixtures of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting [[bacteria]], thus improving host welfare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gibson GR, Roberfroid MB |year=1995|title=Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota: introducing the concept of prebiotics|journal=J.

Synbiotics may be complementary synbiotics, where each component is independently chosen for its potential effect on host health, or synergistic synbiotics, where the prebiotic component is chosen to support the activity of the chosen probiotic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.global-engage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Microbiome-Probiotics-USA-Agenda-2017.pdf|title=Targeted Synbiotics to Manipulate the Microbiome for Health|last=Rastall|first=RA|page=10|access-date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is evaluating if synbiotics can be optimized, (known as 'optibiotics')&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which are purported to enhance the growth and health benefits of existing probiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ift.org/~/media/Food%20Technology/Weekly/Skolida_IPC2017poster.pdf|title=Development of a Targeted Synergistic Synbiotic for Lactobacillus plantarum LPLDL|last1=Kolida|first1=S|last2=Gibson|first2=GR|date=20 June 2017|access-date=2 October 2017|last3=Rastall|first3=RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probiotics are live bacteria which are intended to colonize the large intestine, although as of 2018, there is no evidence that adding dietary bacteria to healthy people has any added effect.&lt;ref name=bridging&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rijkers GT, de Vos WM, Brummer RJ, Morelli L, Corthier G, Marteau P | title = Health benefits and health claims of probiotics: Bridging science and marketing | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 106 | issue = 9 | pages = 1291–96 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21861940 | doi = 10.1017/S000711451100287X | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prebiotic is a food or dietary supplement product that may induce the growth or activity of beneficial microorganisms.

Using prebiotics and probiotics in combination may be described as synbiotic, but the [[United Nations Food &amp; Agriculture Organization]]  recommends that the term "synbiotic" be used only if the net health benefit is synergistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18685504 | doi=10.1097/MCG.0b013e31817f184e | volume=42 Suppl 3 Pt 2 | title=FAO Technical meeting on prebiotics | journal=J Clin Gastroenterol | pages=S156–59 | vauthors=Pineiro M, Asp NG, Reid G, Macfarlane S, Morelli L, Brunser O, Tuohy K| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synbiotic formulations in combination with pasteurized breast milk are under preliminary clinical research for their potential to ameliorate [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] in infants, although there was insufficient evidence to warrant recommending synbiotics for this use as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5015037|year=2016|last1=Johnson-Henry|first1=K.

'''Synchronous coefficient of drag alteration''' ('''SCODA''') is a [[biotechnology]] method for purifying, separating and/or concentrating bio-molecules. SCODA has the ability to separate molecules whose mobility (or drag) can be altered in sync with a driving field. This technique has been primarily used for concentrating and purifying [[DNA]], where DNA mobility changes with an applied [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pel|first1=Joel|last2=Broemeling|first2=David|last3=Mai|first3=Laura|last4=Poon|first4=Hau-Ling|last5=Tropini|first5=Giorgia|last6=Warren|first6=René L.|last7=Holt|first7=Robert A.|last8=Marziali|first8=Andre|date=2009-09-01|title=Nonlinear electrophoretic response yields a unique parameter for separation of biomolecules|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=106|issue=35|pages=14796–14801|doi=10.1073/pnas.0907402106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2728113|pmid=19706437|bibcode=2009PNAS..10614796P|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|title=A novel electrophoretic mechanism and separation parameter for selective nucleic acid concentration based on synchronous coefficient of drag alteration (SCODA)|last=Joel|first=Pel|hdl = 2429/13402|doi = 10.14288/1.0067696|year = 2009|publisher=University of British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrophoretic SCODA has also been demonstrated with [[RNA]] and [[protein]]s.

== Theory ==
As shown below, the SCODA principle applies to any particle driven by a force field in which the particle's mobility is altered in sync with the driving field.

=== SCODA principle ===
For explanatory purposes consider an electrophoretic particle moving (driven) in an electric field. Let:

:&lt;math&gt;E=\widehat{E}E_0cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;  (1)

and&lt;math&gt;dv_{x_{cos2\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}(t)=\mu cos(\omega t) \widehat{E}E_0&lt;/math&gt; (2)

denote an electric field and the velocity of the particle in such a field. If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is constant the time average of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is not constant as a function of time and if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; has a frequency component proportional to &lt;math&gt;cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; the time average of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; need not be zero.

Consider the following example:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(t) = \mu_0 + \mu_1 cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; (3)

Substituting (3) in (2) and computing the time average, &lt;math&gt;\bar{\overrightarrow{v}}&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\overrightarrow{v}}=\frac{1}{2}\mu_1\widehat{E}E_0&lt;/math&gt; (4)

Thus, it is possible to have the particle experience a non-zero time average velocity, in other words, a net electrophoretic drift, even when the time average of the applied electric field is zero.

=== Creation of focusing field geometry ===
Consider a particle under a force field that has a velocity parallel to the field direction and a speed proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric field (any other non-linearity can be employed&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Marziali|first1=Andre|last2=Pel|first2=Joel|last3=Bizzotto|first3=Dan|last4=Whitehead|first4=Lorne A.|date=2005-01-01|title=Novel electrophoresis mechanism based on synchronous alternating drag perturbation|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=26|issue=1|pages=82–90|doi=10.1002/elps.200406140|issn=0173-0835|pmid=15624147|s2cid=12381185}}&lt;/ref&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}=k\widehat{E}(E)^2&lt;/math&gt; (5)

The effective mobility of the particle (the relationship between small changes in drift velocity &lt;math&gt;d\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to small changes in electric field &lt;math&gt;d\overrightarrow{E}&lt;/math&gt;) can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as:

:&lt;math&gt;dv_x={\partial v_x \over \partial E_x}dE_x + {\partial v_x \over \partial E_y}dE_y&lt;/math&gt; (6)

:&lt;math&gt;dv_y={\partial v_y \over \partial E_x}dE_x + {\partial v_y \over \partial E_y}dE_y&lt;/math&gt; (7)

Combining (5), (6) and (7) we get:

:&lt;math&gt;dv_x = k \Biggl[\Biggl(E+\frac{E^2_x}{E}\Biggr)dE_x + \Biggl(\frac{E_xE_y}{E}\Biggr)dE_y\Biggr]&lt;/math&gt; (8)

:&lt;math&gt;dv_y = k \Biggl[\Biggl(\frac{E_xE_y}{E}\Biggr)dE_x + \Biggl(E+\frac{E^2_y}{E}\Biggr)dE_y\Biggr]&lt;/math&gt; (9)

Further consider the field E is applied in a plane and it rotates counter-clockwise at angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, such that the field components are:

:&lt;math&gt;E_x = E cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; (10)

:&lt;math&gt;E_y = E sin (\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; (11)

Substituting (10) and (11) in (8) and (9) and simplifying using trigonometric identities results in a sum of constant terms, sine and cosine, at angular frequency &lt;math&gt;2\omega&lt;/math&gt;. The next calculations will be performed  such that only the cosine terms at angular frequency &lt;math&gt;2\omega&lt;/math&gt; will yield non-zero net drift velocity - therefore we need only evaluate these terms, which will be abbreviated &lt;math&gt;dv_{x_{cos2\omega}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dv_{y_{cos2\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;. The following is obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;dv_{x_{cos2\omega}}=\frac{kE}{2}[cos(2\omega t)]dE_x&lt;/math&gt; (12)

:&lt;math&gt;dv_{y_{cos2\omega}}=\frac{kE}{2}[cos(2\omega t)]dE_y&lt;/math&gt; (13)

Let &lt;math&gt;dE_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dE_y&lt;/math&gt; take the form of a small quadrupole field of intensity &lt;math&gt;dE_q&lt;/math&gt; that varies in a sinusoidal manner proportional to &lt;math&gt;cos(2\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;dE_x = -dE_qx cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; (14)

:&lt;math&gt;dE_y = dE_qy cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; (15)

Substituting (14) and (15) into (12) and (13) and taking the time average we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{dv_x} = \bar{dv_{x_{cos2\omega}}}=-\frac{kEdE_q}{4}x&lt;/math&gt; (16)

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{dv_y} = \bar{dv_{y_{cos2\omega}}}=-\frac{kEdE_q}{4}y&lt;/math&gt; (17)

which can be summarized in vector notation to:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{d\overrightarrow{v}}=-\frac{kEdE_q}{4}\overrightarrow{r}&lt;/math&gt; (18)

Equation (18) shows that for all positions &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{r}&lt;/math&gt; the time averaged velocity is in the direction toward the origin (concentrating the particles towards the origin), with speed proportional to the mobility coefficient k, the strength of the rotating field E and the strength of the perturbing quadrupole field &lt;math&gt;dE_q&lt;/math&gt;.

== DNA concentration and purification ==
[[File:Aurora DNA concentration.png|SCODA DNA concentration using the Aurora system. A – injection of DNA sample. B, C, D – purification of DNA sample. In image D the DNA achieves an equilibrium position between the concentrating SCODA force and the DC wash field. E – focused DNA sample ready to be pipetted from the central extraction well.|thumb|300px]]
DNA molecules are unique in that they are long, charged polymers which when in a separation  medium, such as [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose gel]], can exhibit highly non-linear velocity profiles in response to an electric field.  As such, DNA is easily separated from other  molecules that are not both charged and strongly non-linear, using SCODA&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== DNA injection ===
To perform SCODA concentration of DNA molecules, the sample must be embedded in the separation media (gel) in locations where the electrophoretic field is of optimal intensity. This initial translocation of the sample into the optimal concentration position is referred to as "injection". The optimal position is determined by the gel geometry and location of the SCODA driving electrodes. Initially the sample is located in a buffer solution in the sample chamber, adjacent to the concentration gel. Injection is achieved by the application of a controlled DC electrophoretic field across the sample chamber which results in all charged particles being transferred into the concentration gel. To obtain a good stacking of the sample (i.e. tight DNA band) multiple methods can be employed. One example is to exploit the conductivity ratio between the sample chamber buffer and the concentration gel buffer. If the sample chamber buffer has a low conductivity and the concentration gel buffer has a high conductivity this results in a sharp drop off in electric field at the gel-buffer interface which promotes stacking.

=== DNA concentration ===
Once the DNA is positioned optimally in the concentration gel the SCODA rotating fields are applied. The frequency of the fields can be tuned such that only specific DNA lengths are concentrated. To prevent boiling during the concentration stage due to Joule heating the separation medium may be actively cooled. It is also possible to reverse the phase of SCODA fields, so that molecules are de-focused.

=== DNA purification ===
As only particles that exhibit non-linear velocity experience the SCODA concentrating force, small charged particles that respond linearly to electrophoretic fields are not concentrated. These particles instead of spiraling towards the center of the SCODA gel orbit at a constant radius. If a weak DC field is superimposed on the SCODA rotating fields these particles will be "washed" off from the SCODA gel resulting in highly pure DNA remaining in the gel center.

=== DNA extraction ===
The SCODA DNA force results in the DNA sample concentrating in the center of the SCODA gel. To extract the DNA an extraction well can be pre-formed in the gel and filled with buffer. As the DNA does not experience non-linear mobility in buffer it accumulates in the extraction well. At the end of the concentration and purification stage the sample can then be pipetted out from this well.

== Applications ==

D - SCODA gel at the end of the purification process (no visible contaminants). E - Fluorescent image of SCODA gel from picture D showing stained DNA in the center of the SCODA gel.]]

=== High molecular weight DNA purification ===
The electrophoretic SCODA force is gentle enough to maintain the integrity of high molecular weight DNA as it is concentrated towards the center of the SCODA gel. Depending on the length of the DNA in the sample different protocols can be used to concentrate DNA over 1 Mb in length.

=== Contaminated DNA purification ===
DNA concentration and purification has been achieved directly from tar sands samples resuspended in buffer using the SCODA technique. DNA sequencing was subsequently performed and tentatively over 200 distinct bacterial genomes have been identified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bio.ucalgary.ca/contact/faculty/voordouw/Uncovering%20the%20Microbial%20diversity%20of%20the%20Alberta%20Oil%20Sands%20theough%20Metagenomics.pdf|title=Uncovering the Microbial Diversity of the Alberta Oil Sands through Metagenomics: A Stepping Stone for Enhanced Oil Recovery and Environmental Solutions|last=Voordouw|first=Gerrit|date=|website=|publisher=Genome Alberta|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCODA has also been used for purification of DNA from many other environmental sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Engel|first1=Katja|last2=Pinnell|first2=Lee|last3=Cheng|first3=Jiujun|last4=Charles|first4=Trevor C.|last5=Neufeld|first5=Josh D.|date=2012-01-01|title=Nonlinear electrophoresis for purification of soil DNA for metagenomics|journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods|volume=88|issue=1|pages=35–40|doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2011.10.007|pmid=22056233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Charlop-Powers|first1=Zachary|last2=Milshteyn|first2=Aleksandr|last3=Brady|first3=Sean F|title=Metagenomic small molecule discovery methods|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=19|pages=70–75|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2014.05.021|pmc=4135586|pmid=25000402|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Synthetic biology}}

'''Synthetic biology''' ('''SynBio''') is a multidisciplinary area of research that seeks to create new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign systems that are already found in nature.

It is a branch of science that encompasses a broad range of methodologies from various disciplines, such as [[biotechnology]], [[Biomaterial|biomaterials]], [[Materials science|material science/engineering]], [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular engineering]], [[systems biology]], [[Model lipid bilayer|membrane science]], [[biophysics]], [[Biological engineering|chemical and biological engineering]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical and computer engineering]], [[control engineering]] and [[evolutionary biology]].

Due to more powerful [[genetic engineering]] capabilities and decreased DNA synthesis and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing costs]], the field of synthetic biology is rapidly growing. In 2016, more than 350 companies across 40 countries were actively engaged in synthetic biology applications; all these companies had an estimated net worth of $3.9 billion in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bueso | first1 = F.

== Definition ==
Synthetic biology currently has no generally accepted definition. Here are a few examples:

* "the use of a mixture of physical engineering and genetic engineering to create new (and, therefore, synthetic) life forms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = D | year = 2013 | title = How to object to radically new technologies on the basis of justice: the case of synthetic biology | journal = Bioethics | volume = 27 | issue = 8| pages = 426–434 | doi = 10.1111/bioe.12049 | pmid = 24010854 | s2cid = 23895514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "an emerging field of research that aims to combine the knowledge and methods of biology, engineering and related disciplines in the design of chemically synthesized DNA to create organisms with novel or enhanced characteristics and traits"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gutmann | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = The ethics of synthetic biology: guiding principles for emerging technologies | journal = Hastings Center Report | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 17–22 | doi = 10.1002/j.1552-146x.2011.tb00118.x | pmid = 21845917 | s2cid = 20662786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "designing and constructing [[BioBrick|biological modules]], [[biological systems]], and [[biological machine]]s or, re-design of existing biological systems for useful purposes"&lt;ref name="NakanoEckford2013"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uVhsAAAAQBAJ}}|title=Molecular Communication|last1=Nakano|first1=Tadashi|last2=Eckford|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Haraguchi|first3=Tokuko|date=12 September 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02308-6|name-list-style=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “applying the engineering paradigm of systems design to biological systems in order to produce predictable and robust systems with novel functionalities that do not exist in nature” (The European Commission, 2005) This can include the possibility of a [[molecular assembler]], based upon biomolecular systems such as the [[ribosome]]&lt;ref name="RoadMap"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/roadmaps/Nanotech_Roadmap_2007_main.pdf|title=Productive Nanosystems: A Technology Roadmap|website=Foresight Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic biology has traditionally been divided into two different approaches: top down and bottom up.

# The &lt;u&gt;top down&lt;/u&gt; approach involves using metabolic and genetic engineering techniques to impart new functions to living cells.
# The &lt;u&gt;bottom up&lt;/u&gt; approach involves creating new biological systems ''in vitro'' by bringing together 'non-living' biomolecular components,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwille P | title = Bottom-up synthetic biology: engineering in a tinkerer's world | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6047 | pages = 1252–4 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21885774 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211701 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1252S | s2cid = 43354332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; often with the aim of constructing an [[artificial cell]].

Biological systems are thus assembled module-by-module. [[Cell-free protein synthesis|Cell-free protein expression systems]] are often employed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noireaux V, Libchaber A | title = A vesicle bioreactor as a step toward an artificial cell assembly | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 51 | pages = 17669–74 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15591347 | pmc = 539773 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0408236101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10117669N | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgman CE, Jewett MC | title = Cell-free synthetic biology: thinking outside the cell | journal = Metabolic Engineering | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–9 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21946161 | pmc = 3322310 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymben.2011.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elani Y, Law RV, Ces O | title = Protein synthesis in artificial cells: using compartmentalisation for spatial organisation in vesicle bioreactors | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 24 | pages = 15534–7 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25932977 | doi = 10.1039/C4CP05933F | bibcode = 2015PCCP...1715534E | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; as are membrane-based molecular machinery.

'''1978:''' [[Werner Arber|Arber]], [[Daniel Nathans|Nathans]] and [[Hamilton O. Smith|Smith]] win the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, leading Szybalski to offer an editorial comment in the journal ''[[Gene (journal)|Gene]]'':

== Perspectives ==
Engineers view biology as a ''technology'' (in other words, a given system includes ''[[biotechnology]]'' or its ''[[biological engineering]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 6 | last = Zeng | first = Jie (Bangzhe) | title = On the concept of systems bio-engineering | journal = Coomunication on Transgenic Animals, June 1994, CAS, PRC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered live biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health, as well as advance fundamental knowledge of biological systems (see [[Biomedical Engineering]]) and our environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 6 | last = Chopra | first = Paras | author2 = Akhil Kamma | title = Engineering life through Synthetic Biology | journal = In Silico Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in synthetic biology can be subdivided into broad classifications according to the approach they take to the problem at hand: standardization of biological parts, biomolecular engineering, genome engineering, metabolic engineering. {{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Biomolecular engineering includes approaches that aim to create a toolkit of functional units that can be introduced to present new technological functions in living cells. [[Genetic engineering]] includes approaches to construct synthetic chromosomes or minimal organisms like [[Mycoplasma laboratorium]].

Biomolecular design refers to the general idea of de novo design and additive combination of biomolecular components. Each of these approaches share a similar task: to develop a more synthetic entity at a higher level of complexity by inventively manipulating a simpler part at the preceding level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Channon K, Bromley EH, Woolfson DN | title = Synthetic biology through biomolecular design and engineering | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–8 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644449 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2008.06.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Duran-Nebreda|first1=Salva|last2=Pla|first2=Jordi|last3=Vidiella|first3=Blai|last4=Piñero|first4=Jordi|last5=Conde-Pueyo|first5=Nuria|last6=Solé|first6=Ricard|date=2021-01-15|title=Synthetic Lateral Inhibition in Periodic Pattern Forming Microbial Colonies|journal=ACS Synthetic Biology|volume=10|issue=2|language=en|pages=277–285|doi=10.1021/acssynbio.0c00318|pmid=33449631|pmc=8486170|s2cid=231624252|issn=2161-5063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimizing these exogenous pathways in unnatural systems takes iterative fine tuning of the individual biomolecular components to select for the highest concentrations of the desired product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=van Warmerdam|first=Travis|date=December 25, 2021|title=Exploring biotechnological advancements in the exogenous biological production of industrial small molecules and pharmaceuticals|url=https://www.yourbiohelper.com/research|url-status=live|website=YourBioHelper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, "re-writers" are synthetic biologists interested in testing the irreducibility of biological systems. Due to the complexity of natural biological systems, it would be simpler to rebuild the natural systems of interest from the ground up; In order to provide engineered surrogates that are easier to comprehend, control and manipulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = M | last = Stone | title = Life Redesigned to Suit the Engineering Crowd | journal = Microbe | volume = 1 | issue = 12 | pages = 566–570 | date = 2006 | s2cid = 7171812 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d45/e0f37a0fb6c1a3c659c71ee9c52619b18364.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142707/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d45/e0f37a0fb6c1a3c659c71ee9c52619b18364.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2018-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-writers draw inspiration from [[refactoring]], a process sometimes used to improve computer software.

== Enabling technologies ==
Several novel enabling technologies were critical to the success of synthetic biology. Concepts include [[standardization]] of biological parts and hierarchical abstraction to permit using those parts in synthetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker D, Church G, Collins J, Endy D, Jacobson J, Keasling J, Modrich P, Smolke C, Weiss R | title = Engineering life: building a fab for biology | journal = Scientific American | volume = 294 | issue = 6 | pages = 44–51 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16711359 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0606-44 | bibcode = 2006SciAm.294f..44B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic technologies include reading and writing DNA (sequencing and fabrication). Measurements under multiple conditions are needed for accurate modeling and [[computer-aided design]] (CAD).

=== Sequencing ===
[[DNA sequencing]] determines the order of [[nucleotide]] bases in a DNA molecule. Synthetic biologists use DNA sequencing in their work in several ways. First, large-scale genome sequencing efforts continue to provide information on naturally occurring organisms. This information provides a rich substrate from which synthetic biologists can construct parts and devices. Second, sequencing can verify that the fabricated system is as intended. Third, fast, cheap, and reliable sequencing can facilitate rapid detection and identification of synthetic systems and organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rollie| date = 2012 |title = Designing biological systems: Systems Engineering meets Synthetic Biology| journal = Chemical Engineering Science| volume = 69 | pages = 1–29| doi=10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.068| issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While DNA is most important for information storage, a large fraction of the cell's activities are carried out by proteins. Tools can send proteins to specific regions of the cell and to link different proteins together. The interaction strength between protein partners should be tunable between a lifetime of seconds (desirable for dynamic signaling events) up to an irreversible interaction (desirable for device stability or resilient to harsh conditions). Interactions such as [[coiled coil]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woolfson DN, Bartlett GJ, Bruning M, Thomson AR | title = New currency for old rope: from coiled-coil assemblies to α-helical barrels | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–41 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22445228 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SH3 domain]]-peptide binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dueber JE, Wu GC, Malmirchegini GR, Moon TS, Petzold CJ, Ullal AV, Prather KL, Keasling JD | title = Synthetic protein scaffolds provide modular control over metabolic flux | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 753–9 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19648908 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1557 | s2cid = 2756476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[SpyCatcher|SpyTag/SpyCatcher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddington SC, Howarth M | title = Secrets of a covalent interaction for biomaterials and biotechnology: SpyTag and SpyCatcher | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 29 | pages = 94–9 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26517567 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.10.002 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; offer such control.

In a living cell, molecular motifs are embedded in a bigger network with upstream and downstream components. These components may alter the signaling capability of the modeling module. In the case of ultrasensitive modules, the sensitivity contribution of a module can differ from the sensitivity that the module sustains in isolation.&lt;ref name="altszylerUltrasens2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altszyler E, Ventura A, Colman-Lerner A, Chernomoretz A | title = Impact of upstream and downstream constraints on a signaling module's ultrasensitivity | journal = Physical Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 066003 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25313165 | pmc = 4233326 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/11/6/066003 | bibcode = 2014PhBio..11f6003A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="altszylerUltrasens2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altszyler E, Ventura AC, Colman-Lerner A, Chernomoretz A | title = Ultrasensitivity in signaling cascades revisited: Linking local and global ultrasensitivity estimations | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = e0180083 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28662096 | pmc = 5491127 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0180083 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1280083A | arxiv = 1608.08007 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modeling ===
Models inform the design of engineered biological systems by better predicting system behavior prior to fabrication. Synthetic biology benefits from better models of how biological molecules bind substrates and catalyze reactions, how DNA encodes the information needed to specify the cell and how multi-component integrated systems behave. Multiscale models of gene regulatory networks focus on synthetic biology applications. Simulations can model all biomolecular interactions in [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], regulation and induction of gene regulatory networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carbonell-Ballestero M, Duran-Nebreda S, Montañez R, Solé R, Macía J, Rodríguez-Caso C | title = A bottom-up characterization of transfer functions for synthetic biology designs: lessons from enzymology | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 22 | pages = 14060–14069 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25404136 | pmc = 4267673 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gku964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthetic transcription factors ===
Studies have considered the components of the [[Transcription (biology)|DNA transcription]] mechanism. One desire of scientists creating [[synthetic biological circuit]]s is to be able to control the transcription of synthetic DNA in unicellular organisms ([[prokaryote]]s) and in multicellular organisms ([[eukaryote]]s). One study tested the adjustability of synthetic [[transcription factor]]s (sTFs) in areas of transcription output and cooperative ability among multiple transcription factor complexes.&lt;ref name="Khalil AS 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalil AS, Lu TK, Bashor CJ, Ramirez CL, Pyenson NC, Joung JK, Collins JJ | title = A synthetic biology framework for programming eukaryotic transcription functions | journal = Cell | volume = 150 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–58 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22863014 | pmc = 3653585 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers were able to mutate functional regions called [[zinc finger]]s, the DNA specific component of sTFs, to decrease their affinity for specific operator DNA sequence sites, and thus decrease the associated site-specific activity of the sTF (usually transcriptional regulation). They further used the zinc fingers as components of complex-forming sTFs, which are the [[eukaryotic translation]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Khalil AS 2012"/&gt;

=== Biosensors ===
A [[biosensor]] refers to an engineered organism, usually a bacterium, that is capable of reporting some ambient phenomenon such as the presence of heavy metals or toxins. One such system is the [[Luciferase|Lux operon]] of ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Almeida PE, van Rappard JR, Wu JC | title = In vivo bioluminescence for tracking cell fate and function | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

=== Cell transformation ===
{{Main|Transformation (genetics)}}Cells use interacting genes and proteins, which are called gene circuits, to implement diverse function, such as responding to environmental signals, decision making and communication. Three key components are involved: DNA, RNA and Synthetic biologist designed gene circuits that can control gene expression from several levels including transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels.

Traditional metabolic engineering has been bolstered by the introduction of combinations of foreign genes and optimization by directed evolution. This includes engineering ''E. coli'' and [[yeast]] for commercial production of a precursor of the [[Antimalarial medication|antimalarial drug]], [[Artemisinin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westfall PJ, Pitera DJ, Lenihan JR, Eng D, Woolard FX, Regentin R, Horning T, Tsuruta H, Melis DJ, Owens A, Fickes S, Diola D, Benjamin KR, Keasling JD, Leavell MD, McPhee DJ, Renninger NS, Newman JD, Paddon CJ | title = Production of amorphadiene in yeast, and its conversion to dihydroartemisinic acid, precursor to the antimalarial agent artemisinin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 3 | pages = E111–8 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22247290 | pmc = 3271868 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1110740109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..109E.111W | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entire organisms have yet to be created from scratch, although living cells can be [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with new DNA. Several ways allow constructing synthetic DNA components and even entire [[Artificial gene synthesis|synthetic genomes]], but once the desired genetic code is obtained, it is integrated into a living cell that is expected to manifest the desired new capabilities or [[phenotype]]s while growing and thriving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/eureka-scientists-unveil-giant-leap-towards-synthetic-life-9219644.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220526/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/eureka-scientists-unveil-giant-leap-towards-synthetic-life-9219644.html |archive-date=2022-05-26 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Eureka!

By integrating synthetic biology with [[materials science]], it would be possible to use cells as microscopic molecular foundries to produce materials with properties whose properties were genetically encoded. Re-engineering has produced Curli fibers, the [[amyloid]] component of extracellular material of [[biofilms]], as a platform for programmable [[nanomaterial]]. These nanofibers were genetically constructed for specific functions, including adhesion to substrates, nanoparticle templating and protein immobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nguyen PQ, Botyanszki Z, Tay PK, Joshi NS|date=September 2014|title=Programmable biofilm-based materials from engineered curli nanofibres|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=4945|bibcode=2014NatCo...5.4945N|doi=10.1038/ncomms5945|pmid=25229329|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designed proteins ===

[[File:Top7.png|thumb|The [[Top7]] protein was one of the first proteins designed for a fold that had never been seen before in nature&lt;ref name="kuhlman03"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhlman B, Dantas G, Ireton GC, Varani G, Stoddard BL, Baker D | title = Design of a novel globular protein fold with atomic-level accuracy | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5649 | pages = 1364–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14631033 | doi = 10.1126/science.1089427 | bibcode = 2003Sci...302.1364K | s2cid = 1939390 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3188f905b60172dcad17a9b8c23567400c2bb65f }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Natural proteins can be engineered, for example, by [[directed evolution]], novel protein structures that match or improve on the functionality of existing proteins can be produced. One group generated a [[helix bundle]] that was capable of binding [[oxygen]] with similar properties as [[hemoglobin]], yet did not bind [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koder RL, Anderson JL, Solomon LA, Reddy KS, Moser CC, Dutton PL | title = Design and engineering of an O(2) transport protein | journal = Nature | volume = 458 | issue = 7236 | pages = 305–9 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19295603 | pmc = 3539743 | doi = 10.1038/nature07841 | bibcode = 2009Natur.458..305K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar protein structure was generated to support a variety of [[oxidoreductase]] activities &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farid TA, Kodali G, Solomon LA, Lichtenstein BR, Sheehan MM, Fry BA, Bialas C, Ennist NM, Siedlecki JA, Zhao Z, Stetz MA, Valentine KG, Anderson JL, Wand AJ, Discher BM, Moser CC, Dutton PL | title = Elementary tetrahelical protein design for diverse oxidoreductase functions | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 826–833 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24121554 | pmc = 4034760 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1362 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while another formed a structurally and sequentially novel [[ATPase]].&lt;ref name="WangHecht2020"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=MS|last2=Hecht|first2=MH|title=A Completely De Novo ATPase from Combinatorial Protein Design|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|year=2020|volume=142|issue=36|pages=15230–15234|issn=0002-7863|doi=10.1021/jacs.0c02954|pmid=32833456|s2cid=221308093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group generated a family of G-protein coupled receptors that could be activated by the inert small molecule [[clozapine N-oxide]] but insensitive to the native [[ligand]], [[acetylcholine]]; these receptors are known as [[Receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|DREADDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armbruster BN, Li X, Pausch MH, Herlitze S, Roth BL|author5-link=Bryan Roth | title = Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 5163–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17360345 | pmc = 1829280 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700293104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.5163A | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Novel functionalities or protein specificity can also be engineered using computational approaches.  One study was able to use two different computational methods – a bioinformatics and molecular modeling method to mine sequence databases, and a computational enzyme design method to reprogram enzyme specificity. Both methods resulted in designed enzymes with greater than 100 fold specificity for production of longer chain alcohols from sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mak WS, Tran S, Marcheschi R, Bertolani S, Thompson J, Baker D, Liao JC, Siegel JB | title = Integrative genomic mining for enzyme function to enable engineering of a non-natural biosynthetic pathway | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | pages = 10005 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26598135 | pmc = 4673503 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms10005 | bibcode = 2015NatCo...610005M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common investigation is [[Expanded genetic code|expansion]] of the natural set of 20 [[amino acid]]s. Excluding [[stop codon]]s, 61 [[codons]] have been identified, but only 20 amino acids are coded generally in all organisms. Certain codons are engineered to code for alternative amino acids including: nonstandard amino acids such as O-methyl [[tyrosine]]; or exogenous amino acids such as 4-fluorophenylalanine. Typically, these projects make use of re-coded [[nonsense suppressor]] [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]]-[[Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]] pairs from other organisms, though in most cases substantial engineering is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Q, Parrish AR, Wang L | title = Expanding the genetic code for biological studies | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–36 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19318213 | pmc = 2696486 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2009.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers investigated protein structure and function by reducing the normal set of 20 amino acids. Limited protein sequence libraries are made by generating proteins where groups of amino acids may be replaced by a single amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, AR|author2=Lumb, KJ|author3=Sauer, RT|date=1995|title=Cooperatively folded proteins in random sequence libraries|journal=Nature Structural Biology|volume=2|issue=10|pages=856–864|doi=10.1038/nsb1095-856|pmid=7552709|s2cid=31781262}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, several [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] amino acids within a protein can all be replaced with a single non-polar amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kamtekar S, Schiffer JM, Xiong H, Babik JM, Hecht MH|date=December 1993|title=Protein design by binary patterning of polar and nonpolar amino acids|journal=Science|volume=262|issue=5140|pages=1680–5|bibcode=1993Sci...262.1680K|doi=10.1126/science.8259512|pmid=8259512}}&lt;/ref&gt; One project demonstrated that an engineered version of [[Chorismate mutase]] still had catalytic activity when only 9 amino acids were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Walter KU, Vamvaca K, Hilvert D|date=November 2005|title=An active enzyme constructed from a 9-amino acid alphabet|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=280|issue=45|pages=37742–6|doi=10.1074/jbc.M507210200|pmid=16144843|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and companies practice synthetic biology to synthesize [[industrial enzymes]] with high activity, optimal yields and effectiveness. These synthesized enzymes aim to improve products such as detergents and lactose-free dairy products, as well as make them more cost effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/synthetic-biology/synthetic-biology-applications.html|title=Synthetic Biology Applications|website=www.thermofisher.com|access-date=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The improvements of metabolic engineering by synthetic biology is an example of a biotechnological technique utilized in industry to discover pharmaceuticals and fermentive chemicals. Synthetic biology may investigate modular pathway systems in biochemical production and increase yields of metabolic production.

One important topic in synthetic biology is ''synthetic life'', that is concerned with hypothetical organisms created ''[[in vitro]]'' from [[biomolecule]]s and/or [[hypothetical types of biochemistry|chemical analogues thereof]]. Synthetic life experiments attempt to either probe the [[origins of life]], study some of the properties of life, or more ambitiously to recreate life from non-living ([[abiotic components|abiotic]]) components. Synthetic life biology attempts to create living organisms capable of carrying out important functions, from manufacturing pharmaceuticals to detoxifying polluted land and water.&lt;ref name="enzymes2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Connor |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/major-synthetic-life-breakthrough-as-scientists-make-the-first-artificial-enzymes-9896333.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220526/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/major-synthetic-life-breakthrough-as-scientists-make-the-first-artificial-enzymes-9896333.html |archive-date=2022-05-26 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Major synthetic life breakthrough as scientists make the first artificial enzymes |work=The Independent |location=London |date=1 December 2014 |access-date=2015-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, it offers prospects of using designer biological parts as a starting point for new classes of therapies and diagnostic tools.&lt;ref name="enzymes2014" /&gt;

A living "artificial cell" has been defined as a completely synthetic cell that can capture [[energy]], maintain [[electrochemical gradient|ion gradients]], contain [[macromolecules]] as well as store information and have the ability to [[mutate]].&lt;ref name="Deamer"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deamer D | title = A giant step towards artificial life? | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 336–8 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15935500 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2005.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody has been able to create such a cell.&lt;ref name='Deamer'/&gt;

=== Drug delivery platforms ===
==== Engineered bacteria-based platform ====
Bacteria have long been used in cancer treatment. ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' selectively colonize tumors and reduce their size.&lt;ref name="Zu_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zu C, Wang J|date=August 2014|title=Tumor-colonizing bacteria: a potential tumor targeting therapy|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=225–35|doi=10.3109/1040841X.2013.776511|pmid=23964706|s2cid=26498221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently synthetic biologists reprogrammed bacteria to sense and respond to a particular cancer state. Most often bacteria are used to deliver a therapeutic molecule directly to the tumor to minimize off-target effects. To target the tumor cells, [[peptide]]s that can specifically recognize a tumor were expressed on the surfaces of bacteria. Peptides used include an [[affibody molecule]] that specifically targets human [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|epidermal growth factor receptor 2]]&lt;ref name="Gujrati_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gujrati V, Kim S, Kim SH, Min JJ, Choy HE, Kim SC, Jon S|date=February 2014|title=Bioengineered bacterial outer membrane vesicles as cell-specific drug-delivery vehicles for cancer therapy|journal=ACS Nano|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1525–37|doi=10.1021/nn405724x|pmid=24410085}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a synthetic [[Adhesin molecule (immunoglobulin -like)|adhesin]].&lt;ref name="Piñero-Lambea_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Piñero-Lambea C, Bodelón G, Fernández-Periáñez R, Cuesta AM, Álvarez-Vallina L, Fernández LÁ|date=April 2015|title=Programming controlled adhesion of E. coli to target surfaces, cells, and tumors with synthetic adhesins|journal=ACS Synthetic Biology|volume=4|issue=4|pages=463–73|doi=10.1021/sb500252a|pmc=4410913|pmid=25045780}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other way is to allow bacteria to sense the [[tumor microenvironment]], for example hypoxia, by building an AND logic gate into bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deyneko | first1 = I.V. | last2 = Kasnitz | first2 = N. | last3 = Leschner | first3 = S. | last4 = Weiss | first4 = S. | year = 2016| title = Composing a tumor specific bacterial promoter | journal = PLOS ONE | volume =  11| issue = 5| page =  e0155338| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0155338 | pmid = 27171245 | pmc = 4865170 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1155338D | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria then only release target therapeutic molecules to the tumor through either [[lysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = KC | last2 = Bayles | first2 = KW | year = 2008 | title = Molecular control of bacterial death and lysis | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 85–109 | doi = 10.1128/mmbr.00030-07 | pmid = 18322035 | pmc = 2268280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[bacterial secretion system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganai | first1 = S. | last2 = Arenas | first2 = R.

Multiple types of secretion systems can be used and other strategies as well. The system is inducible by external signals. Inducers include chemicals, electromagnetic or light waves.

Multiple species and strains are applied in these therapeutics. Most commonly used bacteria are ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'', [[Escherichia coli|''Escherichia Coli'']], ''Bifidobacteria'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''. Each of these species have their own property and are unique to cancer therapy in terms of tissue colonization, interaction with immune system and ease of application.

==== Cell-based platform ====
The immune system plays an important role in cancer and can be harnessed to attack cancer cells. Cell-based therapies focus on [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapies]], mostly by engineering [[T cell]]s.

T cell receptors were engineered and ‘trained’ to detect cancer [[epitope]]s. [[Chimeric antigen receptor]]s (CARs) are composed of a fragment of an [[antibody]] fused to intracellular T cell signaling domains that can activate and trigger proliferation of the cell. A second generation CAR-based therapy was approved by FDA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Gene switches were designed to enhance safety of the treatment. Kill switches were developed to terminate the therapy should the patient show severe side effects.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, B.S., Lamb, L.S., Goldman, F. &amp; Di Stasi, A. Improving the safety of cell therapy products by suicide gene transfer. Front.

Although several mechanisms can improve safety and control, limitations include the difficulty of inducing large DNA circuits into the cells and risks associated with introducing foreign components, especially proteins, into cells.

== Ethics ==
{{Update|section|date=January 2019}}
{{Further|Bioethics|Bioeconomy#Issues}}
The creation of new life and the tampering of existing life has raised [[Ethics|ethical concerns]] in the field of synthetic biology and are actively being discussed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=U. N. Environment|date=2019-03-04|title=Frontiers 2018/19: Emerging Issues of Environmental Concern|url=http://www.unenvironment.org/resources/frontiers-201819-emerging-issues-environmental-concern|access-date=2021-01-03|website=UNEP - UN Environment Programme|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common ethical questions include:

* Is it morally right to tamper with nature?
* Is one playing God when creating new life?
* What happens if a synthetic organism accidentally escapes?
* What if an individual misuses synthetic biology and creates a harmful entity (e.g., a biological weapon)?
* Who will have control of and access to the products of synthetic biology? 
* Who will gain from these innovations? Investors? Medical patients? Industrial farmers?
* Does the patent system allow patents on living organisms?

The ethical aspects of synthetic biology has 3 main features: biosafety, biosecurity, and the creation of new life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Synthetic Biology and Ethics: Past, Present, and Future|last=Hayry|first=Mattie|date=April 2017|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|volume=26|issue=2|pages=186–205|doi=10.1017/S0963180116000803|pmid=28361718|s2cid=29992939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ethical issues mentioned include the regulation of new creations, patent management of new creations, benefit distribution, and research integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Synthetic biology applied in the agrifood sector: Public perceptions, attitudes and implications for future studies|last=Jin |display-authors=etal |first=Shan|date=September 2019|journal=Trends in Food Science and Technology|volume=91|pages=454–466|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2019.07.025|s2cid=199632852 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/macq15&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=| title=Synthetic Biology: Ethics, Exceptionalism and Expectations| pages=45| last=Newson|first=AJ|date=2015|journal=Macquarie Law Journal| volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical issues have surfaced for [[recombinant DNA]] and [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO) technologies and extensive regulations of [[genetic engineering]] and pathogen research were in place in many jurisdictions. [[Amy Gutmann]], former head of the Presidential Bioethics Commission, argued that we should avoid the temptation to over-regulate synthetic biology in general, and genetic engineering in particular. According to Gutmann, "Regulatory parsimony is especially important in emerging technologies...where the temptation to stifle innovation on the basis of uncertainty and fear of the unknown is particularly great.  The blunt instruments of statutory and regulatory restraint may not only inhibit the distribution of new benefits,  but can be counterproductive to security and safety by preventing researchers from developing effective safeguards.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gutmann | last = Amy | date = 2012 | title =  The Ethics of Synthetic Biology | volume=41 | issue=4 | pages = 17–22 | journal = The Hastings Center Report | doi = 10.1002/j.1552-146X.2011.tb00118.x | pmid = 21845917 | s2cid = 20662786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "creation" of life ===

One ethical question is whether or not it is acceptable to create new life forms, sometimes known as "playing God". Currently, the creation of new life forms not present in nature is at small-scale, the potential benefits and dangers remain unknown, and careful consideration and oversight are ensured for most studies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many advocates express the great potential value—to agriculture, medicine, and academic knowledge, among other fields—of creating artificial life forms. Creation of new entities could expand scientific knowledge well beyond what is currently known from studying natural phenomena. Yet there is concern that artificial life forms may reduce nature's "purity" (i.e., nature could be somehow corrupted by human intervention and manipulation) and potentially influence the adoption of more engineering-like principles instead of biodiversity- and nature-focused ideals. Some are also concerned that if an artificial life form were to be released into nature, it could hamper biodiversity by beating out natural species for resources (similar to how [[algal bloom]]s kill marine species). Another concern involves the ethical treatment of newly created entities if they happen to [[nociception|sense pain]], [[sentience]], and self-perception. There is an ongoing debate as to whether such life forms should be granted moral or legal rights, though no consensus exists as to how these rights would be administered or enforced.

=== Ethical support for synthetic biology ===
Ethics and moral rationales that support certain applications of synthetic biology include their potential mititgation of substantial global problems of detrimental environmental impacts of conventional [[environmental impact of agriculture|agriculture]] (including [[environmental impact of meat production|meat production]]), [[animal welfare]], [[food security]] and [[human health]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=Christopher J |title=Culture, meat, and cultured meat |journal=Journal of Animal Science |date=3 August 2020 |volume=98 |issue=8 |pages=skaa172 |doi=10.1093/jas/skaa172 |pmid=32745186 |issn=0021-8812|pmc=7398566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hong |first1=Tae Kyung |last2=Shin |first2=Dong-Min |last3=Choi |first3=Joonhyuk |last4=Do |first4=Jeong Tae |last5=Han |first5=Sung Gu |title=Current Issues and Technical Advances in Cultured Meat Production: AReview |journal=Food Science of Animal Resources |date=May 2021 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=355–372 |doi=10.5851/kosfa.2021.e14 |pmid=34017947 |issn=2636-0772|pmc=8112310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Treich |first1=Nicolas |title=Cultured Meat: Promises and Challenges |journal=Environmental and Resource Economics |date=1 May 2021 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=33–61 |doi=10.1007/s10640-021-00551-3 |pmid=33758465 |language=en |issn=1573-1502|pmc=7977488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=Christopher J |title=Culture, meat, and cultured meat |journal=Journal of Animal Science |date=1 August 2020 |volume=98 |issue=8 |pages=skaa172 |doi=10.1093/jas/skaa172|pmid=32745186 |pmc=7398566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Treich |first1=Nicolas |title=Cultured Meat: Promises and Challenges |journal=Environmental and Resource Economics |date=May 2021 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=33–61 |doi=10.1007/s10640-021-00551-3|pmid=33758465 |pmc=7977488 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as potential reduction of human labor needs and, via therapies of diseases, reduction of human suffering and prolonged life.

=== Biosafety and biocontainment ===
What is most ethically appropriate when considering biosafety measures? How can accidental introduction of synthetic life in the natural environment be avoided? Much ethical consideration and critical thought has been given to these questions. Biosafety not only refers to biological containment; it also refers to strides taken to protect the public from potentially hazardous biological agents. Even though such concerns are important and remain unanswered, not all products of synthetic biology present concern for biological safety or negative consequences for the environment. It is argued that most synthetic technologies are benign and are incapable of flourishing in the outside world due to their "unnatural" characteristics as there is yet to be an example of a transgenic microbe conferred with a fitness advantage in the wild.

In general, existing [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard controls]], risk assessment methodologies, and regulations developed for traditional [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) are considered to be sufficient for synthetic organisms.  "Extrinsic" [[biocontainment]] methods in a laboratory context include physical containment through [[biosafety cabinet]]s and [[glovebox]]es, as well as [[personal protective equipment]].  In an agricultural context they include isolation distances and [[pollen]] barriers, similar to methods for [[Biocontainment of genetically modified organisms|biocontainment of GMOs]].  Synthetic organisms may offer increased hazard control because they can be engineered with "intrinsic" biocontainment methods that limit their growth in an uncontained environment, or prevent [[horizontal gene transfer]] to natural organisms.  Examples of intrinsic biocontainment include [[auxotrophy]], biological [[kill switch]]es, inability of the organism to replicate or to pass modified or synthetic genes to offspring, and the use of [[Xenobiology|xenobiological]] organisms using alternative biochemistry, for example using artificial [[xeno nucleic acid]]s (XNA) instead of DNA.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/bfd7d06c-d3ae-11e5-a4b5-01aa75ed71a1/language-en|title=Opinion on synthetic biology II: Risk assessment methodologies and safety aspects|date=2016-02-12|website=EU [[Directorate-General for Health and Consumers]]|doi=10.2772/63529|publisher=Publications Office|author1=European Commission. Directorate General for Health Consumers|isbn=9789279439162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding auxotrophy, bacteria and yeast can be engineered to be unable to produce [[histidine]], an important amino acid for all life. Such organisms can thus only be grown on histidine-rich media in laboratory conditions, nullifying fears that they could spread into undesirable areas.

=== Biosecurity ===
Some ethical issues relate to biosecurity, where biosynthetic technologies could be deliberately used to cause harm to society and/or the environment. Since synthetic biology raises ethical issues and biosecurity issues, humanity must consider and plan on how to deal with potentially harmful creations, and what kinds of ethical measures could possibly be employed to deter nefarious biosynthetic technologies.  With the exception of regulating synthetic biology and biotechnology companies,&lt;ref name="Bügl, H. et al. 2007 627–629"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bügl H, Danner JP, Molinari RJ, Mulligan JT, Park HO, Reichert B, Roth DA, Wagner R, Budowle B, Scripp RM, Smith JA, Steele SJ, Church G, Endy D | title = DNA synthesis and biological security | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 627–9 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17557094 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0607-627 | s2cid = 7776829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.synbioproject.org/site/assets/files/1335/hastings.pdf|title = Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology: An Overview of the Debates}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the issues are not seen as new because they were raised during the earlier [[recombinant DNA]] and [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO) debates and extensive regulations of [[genetic engineering]] and pathogen research are already in place in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="bioethics.gov"&gt;Presidential Commission for the study of Bioethical Issues, December 2010 [http://bioethics.gov/synthetic-biology-report NEW DIRECTIONS The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies] Retrieved 2012-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== European Union ===

The [[European Union]]-funded project SYNBIOSAFE&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.synbiosafe.eu/|title=Synbiosafe|website=Synbiosafe}}&lt;/ref&gt; has issued reports on how to manage synthetic biology. A 2007 paper identified key issues in safety, security, ethics and the science-society interface, which the project defined as public education and ongoing dialogue among scientists, businesses, government and ethicists.&lt;ref name="Priorities"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt M, Ganguli-Mitra A, Torgersen H, Kelle A, Deplazes A, Biller-Andorno N | title = A priority paper for the societal and ethical aspects of synthetic biology | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 3–7 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816794 | pmc = 2759426 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9034-7 | url = http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Schmidt_etal-2009-SSBJ.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt M.

The Technoscience and its Societal Consequences".] Springer Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The key security issues that SYNBIOSAFE identified involved engaging companies that sell synthetic DNA and the [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]] community of amateur biologists. Key ethical issues concerned the creation of new life forms.

A subsequent report focused on biosecurity, especially the so-called [[dual use technology|dual-use]] challenge. For example, while synthetic biology may lead to more efficient production of medical treatments, it may also lead to synthesis or modification of harmful pathogens (e.g., [[smallpox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelle A | title = Ensuring the security of synthetic biology-towards a 5P governance strategy | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 85–90 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816803 | pmc = 2759433 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9041-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biohacking community remains a source of special concern, as the distributed and diffuse nature of open-source biotechnology makes it difficult to track, regulate or mitigate potential concerns over biosafety and biosecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt M | title = Diffusion of synthetic biology: a challenge to biosafety | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–6 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 19003431 | pmc = 2671588 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-008-9018-z | url = http://www.markusschmidt.eu/pdf/Diffusion_of_synthetic_biology.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

COSY, another European initiative, focuses on public perception and communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synbio.at/ COSY: Communicating Synthetic Biology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kronberger N, Holtz P, Kerbe W, Strasser E, Wagner W | title = Communicating Synthetic Biology: from the lab via the media to the broader public | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 19–26 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816796 | pmc = 2759424 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9031-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cserer A, Seiringer A | title = Pictures of Synthetic Biology : A reflective discussion of the representation of Synthetic Biology (SB) in the German-language media and by SB experts | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 27–35 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816797 | pmc = 2759430 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9038-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To better communicate synthetic biology and its societal ramifications to a broader public, COSY and SYNBIOSAFE published ''SYNBIOSAFE'', a 38-minute documentary film, in October 2009.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The International Association Synthetic Biology has proposed self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Report of IASB [http://www.ia-sb.eu/tasks/sites/synthetic-biology/assets/File/pdf/iasb_report_biosecurity_syntheticbiology.pdf "Technical solutions for biosecurity in synthetic biology"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719031805/http://www.ia-sb.eu/tasks/sites/synthetic-biology/assets/File/pdf/iasb_report_biosecurity_syntheticbiology.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}, Munich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This proposes specific measures that the synthetic biology industry, especially DNA synthesis companies, should implement. In 2007, a group led by scientists from leading DNA-synthesis companies published a "practical plan for developing an effective oversight framework for the DNA-synthesis industry".&lt;ref name="Bügl, H. et al. 2007 627–629" /&gt;

=== United States ===

In January 2009, the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] funded the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]], the [[Hastings Center]], and the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] to examine the public perception, ethics and policy implications of synthetic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Parens E., Johnston J., Moses J. [http://www.thehastingscenter.org/who-we-are/our-research/selected-past-projects/ethical-issues-in-synthetic-biology-2/ Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology.] 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9–10, 2009, the National Academies' Committee of Science, Technology &amp; Law convened a symposium on "Opportunities and Challenges in the Emerging Field of Synthetic Biology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/stl/PGA_050738|title=Policy and Global Affairs at the National Academies|website=sites.nationalacademies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of the [[Mycoplasma laboratorium|first synthetic genome]] and the accompanying media coverage about "life" being created, President [[Barack Obama]] established the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]] to study synthetic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Commission for the study of Bioethical Issues, December 2010 [http://bioethics.gov/node/353 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The commission convened a series of meetings, and issued a report in December 2010 titled "New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies." The commission stated that "while Venter's achievement marked a significant technical advance in demonstrating that a relatively large genome could be accurately synthesized and substituted for another, it did not amount to the “creation of life”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioethics.gov/node/353 Synthetic Biology F.A.Q.'s | Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]&lt;/ref&gt; It noted that synthetic biology is an emerging field, which creates potential risks and rewards. The commission did not recommend policy or oversight changes and called for continued funding of the research and new funding for monitoring, study of emerging ethical issues and public education.&lt;ref name="bioethics.gov" /&gt;

Synthetic biology, as a major tool for biological advances, results in the "potential for developing biological weapons, possible unforeseen negative impacts on human health ... and any potential environmental impact".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erickson B, Singh R, Winters P | title = Synthetic biology: regulating industry uses of new biotechnologies | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6047 | pages = 1254–6 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21885775 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211066 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1254E | s2cid = 1568198 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6ae989f6b07dc3c8a8694792d6fe8f036a0e0292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of such technology could also make the production of [[Biological agent|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]] available to a wider array of state and [[non-state actors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Kelley M.

Federal guidelines on genetic manipulation are being proposed by "the President's Bioethics Commission ... in response to the announced creation of a self-replicating cell from a chemically synthesized genome, put forward 18 recommendations not only for regulating the science ... for educating the public".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Opposition ===
On March 13, 2012, over 100 environmental and civil society groups, including [[Friends of the Earth]], the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]] and the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued the manifesto ''The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology''. This manifesto calls for a worldwide moratorium on the release and commercial use of synthetic organisms until more robust regulations and rigorous biosafety measures are established. The groups specifically call for an outright ban on the use of synthetic biology on the [[human genome]] or [[human microbiome]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Xue for Harvard Magazine. September–October 2014 [http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/09/synthetic-biologys-new-menagerie Synthetic Biology's New Menagerie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yojana Sharma for Scidev.net March 15, 2012. [http://www.scidev.net/global/genomics/news/ngos-call-for-international-regulation-of-synthetic-biology.html NGOs call for international regulation of synthetic biology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lewontin]] wrote that some of the safety tenets for oversight discussed in ''The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology'' are reasonable, but that the main problem with the recommendations in the manifesto is that "the public at large lacks the ability to enforce any meaningful realization of those recommendations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/may/08/new-synthetic-biology-who-gains/?insrc=rel#fnr-1 The New Synthetic Biology: Who Gains?] (2014-05-08), [[Richard C.

== Health and safety ==
{{Main|Hazards of synthetic biology}}

The hazards of synthetic biology include [[biosafety]] hazards to workers and the public, [[biosecurity]] hazards stemming from deliberate engineering of organisms to cause harm, and environmental hazards.  The biosafety hazards are similar to those for existing fields of biotechnology, mainly exposure to pathogens and toxic chemicals, although novel synthetic organisms may have novel risks.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/01/24/synthetic-biology/|title=Synthetic Biology and Occupational Risk|last1=Howard|first1=John|last2=Murashov|first2=Vladimir|date=2017-01-24|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|access-date=2018-11-30|last3=Schulte|first3=Paul|volume=14|issue=3|pages=224–236|pmid=27754800|doi=10.1080/15459624.2016.1237031|s2cid=205893358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=John|last2=Murashov|first2=Vladimir|last3=Schulte|first3=Paul|date=2016-10-18|title=Synthetic biology and occupational risk|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=14|issue=3|pages=224–236|doi=10.1080/15459624.2016.1237031|pmid=27754800|s2cid=205893358|issn=1545-9624}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For biosecurity, there is concern that synthetic or redesigned organisms could theoretically be used for [[bioterrorism]].

Many of the estimated 1.2 million bacteria species that remain have yet to be cultured and identified, in part due to inabilities to be cultured [[axenic]]ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Eric J.|date=2012-08-15|title=Growing Unculturable Bacteria |journal=Journal of Bacteriology|language=en|volume=194|issue=16|pages=4151–4160|doi=10.1128/JB.00345-12 |pmid=22661685|pmc=3416243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for symbiosis between microbes strongly suggests it to have been a necessary precursor of the evolution of land plants and for their transition from algal communities in the sea to land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Delaux|first1=Pierre-Marc|last2=Radhakrishnan|first2=Guru V.|last3=Jayaraman|first3=Dhileepkumar|last4=Cheema|first4=Jitender|last5=Malbreil|first5=Mathilde|last6=Volkening|first6=Jeremy D.|last7=Sekimoto|first7=Hiroyuki|last8=Nishiyama|first8=Tomoaki|last9=Melkonian|first9=Michael|date=2015-10-27|title=Algal ancestor of land plants was preadapted for symbiosis |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=112|issue=43|pages=13390–13395|doi=10.1073/pnas.1515426112 |pmc=4629359|pmid=26438870|bibcode=2015PNAS..11213390D|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; When designing synthetic consortia, or editing naturally occurring consortia, synthetic biologists keep track of pH, temperature, initial metabolic profiles, incubation times, growth rate, and other pertinent variables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Biofuel==
One of the more salient applications of engineering behaviors and interactions between microbes in a community is the ability to combine or even switch metabolisms. The combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes allows the unique possibility of a self-sufficient community that may produce desired [[biofuel]]s to be collected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Co-culture dyads of autotrophic ''Synechococcus elongatus'' and heterotrophic ''Escherichia coli'' were found to be able to grow synchronously when the strain of ''S. elongatus'' was transformed to include a gene for sucrose export.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hays|first1=Stephanie G.|last2=Yan|first2=Leo L. W.|last3=Silver|first3=Pamela A.|last4=Ducat|first4=Daniel C.|date=2017-01-23|title=Synthetic photosynthetic consortia define interactions leading to robustness and photoproduction |journal=Journal of Biological Engineering|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1186/s13036-017-0048-5 |pmc=5259876|pmid=28127397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commensal combination of the sucrose-producing cyanobacteria with the modified ''E. coli'' metabolism may allow for a diverse array of metabolic products such as various butanol biofuels, terpenoids, and fatty-acid derived fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kang|first1=Aram|last2=Lee|first2=Taek Soon|date=2015-10-27|title=Converting Sugars to Biofuels: Ethanol and Beyond |journal=Bioengineering|volume=2|issue=4|pages=184–203|doi=10.3390/bioengineering2040184 |pmc=5597089|pmid=28952477|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including a heterotroph also provides a solution to the issues of contamination when producing carbohydrates, as competition may limit contaminant species viability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In isolated systems this can be a restriction to the feasibility of large-scale biofuel operations, like algae ponds, where contamination can significantly reduce the desired output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Robert C. |last2=Lopez |first2=Salvador |last3=Meenach |first3=Chris |last4=Burnett |first4=Mike |last5=Lee |first5=Philip A. |last6=Nohilly |first6=Fiona |last7=Behnke |first7=Craig |title=Contamination Management in Low Cost Open Algae Ponds for Biofuels Production |journal=Industrial Biotechnology |date=June 2014 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=221–7 |doi=10.1089/ind.2013.0036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through interactions between ''[[Geobacter]]'' ''spp.'' and [[Methanogen]]s from the soil in a rice paddy field, it was discovered that the use of interspecies electron transfer stimulated the production of methane.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kato |first1=Souichiro |last2=Hashimoto |first2=Kazuhito |last3=Watanabe |first3=Kazuya |title=Methanogenesis facilitated by electric syntrophy via (semi)conductive iron-oxide minerals |journal=Environmental Microbiology |date=July 2012 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=1646–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02611.x |pmid=22004041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering the abundance of conductive metals in soils and the use of [[Methane]] (natural gas) as a fuel, this may lead to a bioenergy-producing process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Bioremediation==
Use of the extensive range of microbial metabolism offers opportunities to those interested in [[Bioremediation]]. Through consortia, synthetic biologists have been able to design an enhanced efficiency in bacteria that can excrete bio-surfactants as well as degrade hydrocarbons for the interests of cleaning oil contamination in Assam, India.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Patowary|first1=Kaustuvmani|last2=Patowary|first2=Rupshikha|last3=Kalita|first3=Mohan C.|last4=Deka|first4=Suresh|date=2016-07-14|title=Development of an Efficient Bacterial Consortium for the Potential Remediation of Hydrocarbons from Contaminated Sites |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=7|pages=1092|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.01092 |pmc=4943938|pmid=27471499|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment took combinations of five native naturally occurring hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, and analyzed the different cocktails to see which degraded poly-aromatic hydrocarbons the best.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The combination of ''Bacillus pumilis'' KS2 and ''Bacillus cereus'' R2 was found to be the most effective, degrading 84.15% of the [[Total petroleum hydrocarbon|TPH]] after 5 weeks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Further remediation efforts have turned to the issue of agricultural [[Pesticide]] run-off. Pesticides vary in class and function, and in high concentration often lead to highly toxic environmental risks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Doolotkeldieva|first1=Tinatin|last2=Konurbaeva|first2=Maxabat|last3=Bobusheva|first3=Saykal|date=2018-11-01|title=Microbial communities in pesticide-contaminated soils in Kyrgyzstan and bioremediation possibilities |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|language=en|volume=25|issue=32|pages=31848–31862|doi=10.1007/s11356-017-0048-5 |pmc=6208721|pmid=28884389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the over-500 types of pesticides in current use, two serious issues are their general lack of [[biodegradability]] and unpredictability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van der Werf |first1=Hayo M.G. |title=Assessing the impact of pesticides on the environment |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment |date=December 1996 |volume=60 |issue=2–3 |pages=81–96 |doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(96)01096-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kyrgyzstan, researchers assessed soil around a pesticide dump and discovered not only that the soil had poor microflora diversity, but that some of the species that were present used metabolic pathways to digest the pesticides.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The two most-efficient species found were ''Pseudomonas fluorescens'' and ''Bacillus polymyxa'', with ''B. polymyxa'' degrading 48.2% of the pesticide [[Aldrin]] after 12 days.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, when the strains were combined with each other as well as some other less-efficient yet native bacteria, pesticide degradation increased to 54.0% in the same conditions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Doolatkeldieva et al. discussed their findings, saying &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is consequently possible that the degrading capacity of the bacteria could be increased only through co-cultivation, which shows that these bacteria naturally coexist and are dependent on each other for the utilization of environmental substances. In the oxidation and hydrolysis pathways of pesticide degradation, each bacterium can produce metabolites that will be utilized by the enzyme system of the next bacterium".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Bioplastic==
As an answer to the increase in use of non-biodegradable, oil-based plastics and its subsequent accumulation as waste, scientists have developed biodegradable and compostable alternatives often called [[Bioplastic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Song |first1=J. H. |last2=Murphy |first2=R. J. |last3=Narayan |first3=R. |last4=Davies |first4=G. B. H. |title=Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=27 July 2009 |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2127–2139 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0289 |pmc=2873018 |pmid=19528060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all biologically created plastics are necessarily biodegradable, and this can be a source of confusion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biokunststoffe.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=121&amp;lang=en|title=What are Bioplastics?|last=Kunststoffe|date=August 2008|website=Bio-plastics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2019}} Therefore it is important to distinguish between the types of bioplastics, biodegradable bioplastics which can be degraded by some microflora and simply bio-based plastics which are a renewable source of plastic but require more effort to dispose of.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One of the bioplastics of interest is [[Polyhydroxybutyrate]], abbreviated to PHB. PHB is a biodegradable bioplastic that has applications for food packaging due to being non-toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hankermeyer |first1=CR |last2=Tjeerdema |first2=RS |title=Polyhydroxybutyrate: plastic made and degraded by microorganisms. |journal=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |date=1999 |volume=159 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-1496-0_1 |pmid=9921137 |isbn=978-1-4612-7167-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repurposed ''E. coli'', as well as ''Halomonas boliviensis'', have been shown to produce PHB.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Taylor L. |last2=Young |first2=Eric J. |last3=Ducat |first3=Daniel C. |title=A synthetic, light-driven consortium of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria enables stable polyhydroxybutyrate production |journal=Metabolic Engineering |date=November 2017 |volume=44 |pages=236–245 |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2017.10.009 |pmid=29061492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rahman |first1=Asif |last2=Linton |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Hatch |first3=Alex D |last4=Sims |first4=Ronald C |last5=Miller |first5=Charles D |title=Secretion of polyhydroxybutyrate in Escherichia coli using a synthetic biological engineering approach |journal=Journal of Biological Engineering |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=24 |doi=10.1186/1754-1611-7-24 |pmc=4015293 |pmid=24139229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PHB production starting from carbon dioxide in a co-culture between [[Synechococcus|''S. elongatus'']] and [[Halomonas|H. boliviensis]] has proven to be a stable continually-productive pair for 5 months without the aid of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Microbial syntrophy ==
Syntrophy is often used synonymously for mutualistic [[symbiosis]] especially between at least two different bacterial species. Syntrophy differs from [[symbiosis]] in a way that syntrophic relationship is primarily based on closely linked metabolic interactions to maintain thermodynamically favorable lifestyle in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sieber |first=Jessica R. |last2=McInerney |first2=Michael J. |last3=Gunsalus |first3=Robert P. |date=2012 |title=Genomic insights into syntrophy: the paradigm for anaerobic metabolic cooperation |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22803797/ |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=66 |pages=429–452 |doi=10.1146/annurev-micro-090110-102844 |issn=1545-3251 |pmid=22803797}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2009-12-01 |title=Syntrophy in anaerobic global carbon cycles |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0958166909001293 |journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology |language=en |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=623–632 |doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2009.10.001 |issn=0958-1669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McInerney |first=Michael J |date=May 1, 2007 |title=The genome of Syntrophus aciditrophicus: Life at the thermodynamic limit of microbial growth |url=https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0610456104 |journal=PNAS |volume=104 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syntrophy plays an important role in a large number of microbial processes especially in oxygen limited environments, methanogenic environments and anaerobic systems.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McInerney |first=Michael J |last2=Sieber |first2=Jessica R |last3=Gunsalus |first3=Robert P |date=2009-12-01 |title=Syntrophy in anaerobic global carbon cycles |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166909001293 |journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology |series=Chemical biotechnology ● Pharmaceutical biotechnology |language=en |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=623–632 |doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2009.10.001 |issn=0958-1669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-13615-3 |title=(Endo)symbiotic Methanogenic Archaea |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13615-3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anoxic or methanogenic environments such as wetlands, swamps, paddy fields, landfills, digestive tract of [[ruminant]]s, and anerobic digesters syntrophy is employed to overcome the energy constraints as the reactions in these environments proceed close to [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Bradley E |last2=McInerney |first2=Michael J |date=24 January 2002 |title=Anaerobic microbial metabolism can proceed close to thermodynamic limits |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/415454a |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism of microbial syntrophy ===
The main mechanism of syntrophy is removing the metabolic end products of one species so as to create an energetically favorable environment for another species.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This obligate metabolic cooperation is required to facilitate the degradation of complex organic substrates under anaerobic conditions. Complex organic compounds such as ethanol, [[propionate]], [[butyrate]], and [[Lactic acid|lactate]] cannot be directly used as substrates for [[methanogenesis]] by methanogens.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; On the other hand, [[fermentation]] of these organic compounds cannot occur in fermenting microorganisms unless the hydrogen concentration is reduced to a low level by the methanogens. The key mechanism that ensures the success of syntrophy is interspecies electron transfer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Mingyuan |last2=Zang |first2=Lihua |date=2019 |title=A review if interspecies electron transfer in anaerobic digestion |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/310/4/042026/pdf |journal=IOP conf. ser: Earth Environ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interspecies electron transfer can be carried out via three ways: [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]], interspecies formate transfer and interspecies direct electron transfer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rotaru |first=Amelia-Elena |date=2012 |title=Interspecies Electron Transfer via Hydrogen and Formate Rather than Direct Electrical Connections in Cocultures of Pelobacter carbinolicus and Geobacter sulfurreducens |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485699/ |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reverse electron flow|Reverse electron transport]] is prominent in syntrophic metabolism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The metabolic reactions and the energy involved for syntrophic degradation with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption:&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Yao |last2=Li |first2=Chunxing |last3=Yuan |first3=Zengwei |last4=Wang |first4=Ruming |last5=Angelidaki |first5=Irini |last6=Zhu |first6=Gefu |date=2023-01-15 |title=Syntrophy mechanism, microbial population, and process optimization for volatile fatty acids metabolism in anaerobic digestion |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894722046162 |journal=Chemical Engineering Journal |language=en |volume=452 |pages=139137 |doi=10.1016/j.cej.2022.139137 |issn=1385-8947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of syntrophic mechanism in a co-culture which has an Organism S and organism M.o.H which involves the oxidization od [[ethanol]] into acetate and [[methane]] mediated by [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]]. Individuals of organism S are observed as obligate [[anaerobic bacteria]] that use ethanol as an [[electron donor]], whereas M.o.H  (are [[methanogens]] that oxidize hydrogen gas to produce methane.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Organism S:''' 2 Ethanol + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Acetate&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ΔG°' = +9.6 kJ per reaction)

'''Strain M.o.H.:''' 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO2 → Methane + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (ΔG°' = -131 kJ per reaction)

'''Co-culture:'''2 Ethanol + CO2 → 2 Acetate&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Methane (ΔG°' = -113 kJ per reaction)

The oxidation of ethanol by organism S was made possible by consuming the hydrogen produced by organism S by the methanogen M.o.H by turning the positive [[Gibbs free energy]] into negative Gibbs free energy. This situation favors growth of organism S and also provides energy for methanogens by consuming hydrogen. Down the line, acetate accumulation is also prevented by similar syntrophic relationship.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Syntrophic degradation of substrates like butyrate and benzoate can also happen without hydrogen consumption.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

An example of propionate and butyrate degradation with interspecies formate transfer carried out by the mutual system of ''[[Syntrophomonas wolfei]]'' and ''Methanobacterium formicicum'':&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Propionate＋2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O＋2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Acetate&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ＋3Formate&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ＋3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (ΔG°'=＋65.3 kJ/mol)

Butyrate＋2H2O＋2CO2 → 2Acetate- ＋3Formate- ＋3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  ΔG°'=＋38.5 kJ/mol)

Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) which involves electron transfer without any electron carrier such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or formate was reported in the co-culture system of ''Geobacter mettalireducens'' and [[Methanosaeta|''Methanosaeto'']] or ''[[Methanosarcina]]''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/direct-interspecies-electron-transfer#:~:text=Interesting%20interactions%20such%20as%20the,carbon%20electrodes%20within%20the%20reactor. |access-date=2022-11-09 |website=www.sciencedirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of microbial syntrophy ==

=== Syntrophy in ruminants ===
The defining feature of&amp;nbsp;[[ruminant]]s, such as cows and goats, is a stomach called a&amp;nbsp;[[rumen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=AnimalSmart.org |title=What's a Rumen |url=https://animalsmart.org/species/what%27s-a-rumen- |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=Default |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The rumen contains billions of microbes, many of which are syntrophic.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ng |first=Filomena |date=Dec 2015 |title=An adhesin from hydrogen-utilizing rumen methanogen Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1 binds a broad range of hydrogen-producing microorganisms |url=https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1462-2920.13155 |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=3010–3021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anaerobic fermenting microbes in the rumen (and other gastrointestinal tracts) are capable of degrading organic matter to [[short chain fatty acids]], and hydrogen.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The accumulating [[hydrogen]] inhibits the microbe's ability to continue degrading organic matter, but the presence of syntrophic hydrogen-consuming microbes allows continued growth by metabolizing the waste products.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In addition, fermentative bacteria gain maximum energy yield when [[protons]] are used as electron acceptor with concurrent [[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;production.&amp;nbsp;Hydrogen-consuming organisms include [[methanogens]], sulfate-reducers, [[acetogens]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sapkota |first=Anupama |date=2022-07-12 |title=Syntrophism or Syntrophy Interaction- Definition, Examples |url=https://thebiologynotes.com/syntrophism-or-syntrophy/ |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=The Biology Notes |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodegradation of pollutants ===

Syntrophic microbial [[food webs]] play an integral role in bioremediation especially in environments contaminated with crude oil and petrol. Environmental contamination with [[Petroleum|oil]] is of high ecological importance and can be effectively mediated through syntrophic degradation by complete mineralization of [[alkane]], [[aliphatic]] and [[hydrocarbon]] chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callaghan |first=A V |date=January 2012 |title=The genome sequence of Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans AK-01: a blueprint for anaerobic alkane oxidation |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21651686/ |journal=Environmental Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferry |first=J.

This breakdown is crucial in the processes of&amp;nbsp;[[bioremediation]]&amp;nbsp;and global carbon cycling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Syntrophic microbial communities are key players in the breakdown of&amp;nbsp;[[aromatic compounds]], which are common pollutants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The degradation of aromatic [[Benzoic acid|benzoate]] to [[methane]] produces intermediate compounds such as [[formate]], [[acetate]], {{CO2|link=yes}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The buildup of these products makes benzoate degradation thermodynamically unfavorable. These intermediates can be metabolized syntrophically by [[methanogens]] and makes the degradation process thermodynamically favorable&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Degradation of amino acids'''

Studies have shown that bacterial degradation of&amp;nbsp;[[amino acids]]&amp;nbsp;can be significantly enhanced through the process of syntrophy.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zindel |first1=U. |last2=Freudenberg |first2=W. |last3=Rieth |first3=M. |last4=Andreesen |first4=J.

These scavengers, like&amp;nbsp;''[[Methanospirillum]]&amp;nbsp;''and''&amp;nbsp;[[Acetobacterium]],''&amp;nbsp;metabolize the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; waste produced during amino acid breakdown, preventing a toxic build-up.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another way to improve amino acid breakdown is through interspecies [[electron transfer]] mediated by formate. Species like ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'' employ this method.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Amino acid fermenting anaerobes such as ''[[Clostridium]]'' species, ''Peptostreptococcus asacchaarolyticus'', ''Acidaminococcus fermentans'' were known to breakdown amino acids like [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]] with the help of hydrogen scavenging methanogenic partners without going through the usual [[Stickland fermentation]] pathway&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

'''Anaerobic digestion'''

Effective syntrophic cooperation between propionate oxidizing bacteria, acetate oxidizing bacteria and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/acetate consuming methanogens is necessary to successfully carryout anaerobic digestion to produce biomethane&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''''' (originally in [[Latin language|Latin]] written '''''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturæ}}''''' with the [[Orthographic ligature|ligature]] [[æ]]) is one of the major works of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] botanist, zoologist and physician [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) and introduced the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. Although the system, now known as [[binomial nomenclature]], was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers, [[Gaspard Bauhin|Gaspard]] and [[Johann Bauhin|Johann]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Windelspecht|Windelspecht (2002)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus was first to use it consistently throughout his book. The first edition was published in 1735. The full title of the 10th edition (1758), which was the most important one, was ''{{Lang|la|Systema naturæ per regna tria naturæ, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis}}'' or translated: "System of nature through the three kingdoms of nature, according to classes, orders, genera and species, with characters, differences, synonyms, places".

The [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition of this book]] (1758) is considered the starting point of [[zoological nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bellows |editor1-first=T.

Another again enhanced work in the same style and titled "''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''" was published by [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]] between 1788 and 1793. Since at least the early 20th century, zoologists have commonly recognized this as the last edition belonging to this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/indexanimalium/TaxonomicNames/ |title=Sherborn, C.

== Overview ==
Linnaeus (later known as "Carl von Linné", after his ennoblement in 1761)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearn |first=W. T. |author-link=William T. Stearn |contribution=An introduction to the Species Plantarum and cognate botanical works of Linnaeus |title=Species Plantarum |edition=1957 Ray Society facsimile |page=14 |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; published the first edition of ''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' in the year 1735, during his stay in the [[Netherlands]]. As was customary for the [[scientific literature]] of its day, the book was published in [[Latin]]. In it, he outlined his ideas for the [[hierarchical classification]] of the natural world, dividing it into the [[Animal|animal kingdom]] (''{{Lang|la|regnum animale}}''), the [[Plantae|plant kingdom]] (''{{Lang|la|regnum vegetabile}}''), and the "[[mineral|mineral kingdom]]" (''{{Lang|la|regnum lapideum}}'').

Linnaeus's ''Systema Naturae'' lists only about 10,000 species of organisms, of which about 6,000 are plants and 4,236 are animals.&lt;ref name =stern &gt;{{cite journal |last=Stearn |first=William T. |year=1959 |title=The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology |journal=[[Systematic Zoology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=4–22 |jstor=2411603 |url=http://cordyceps.us/files/stearn_1959_.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028133630/http://cordyceps.us/files/stearn_1959_.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-28 |doi=10.2307/2411603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian of botany [[William T. Stearn]], "Even in 1753 he believed that the number of species of plants in the whole world would hardly reach 10,000; in his whole career he named about 7,700 species of flowering plants."&lt;ref name = stern/&gt;

Linnaeus developed his classification of the plant kingdom in an attempt to describe and understand the natural world as a reflection of the logic of [[God]]'s creation.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web |last=Quammen |first=David |title=A Passion for Order |publisher=National Geographic Magazine |date=June 2007 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2007/06/linnaeus-name-giver/david-quammen-text |access-date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Linnaean taxonomy#For plants|sexual system]], where species with the same number of [[stamen]]s were treated in the same group, was convenient but in his view artificial.&lt;ref name=NG /&gt; Linnaeus believed in [[God]]'s creation, and that there were no deeper relationships to be expressed. He is frequently quoted to have said: "God created, Linnaeus organized" (Latin: ''Deus creavit, Linnaeus disposuit'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warne|first1=K.|title=Organization Man|journal=Smithsonian Magazine|date=May 2007|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/organization-man-151908042/|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of animals was more natural. For instance, [[human]]s were for the first time placed together with other [[primate]]s, as [[Anthropomorpha]].

As a result of the popularity of the work, and the number of new specimens sent to him from around the world,  Linnaeus kept publishing new and ever-expanding editions of his work.&lt;ref name="Everts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Everts|first1=Sarah|title=Information Overload|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=26–33|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/information-overload|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from eleven very large pages in the first edition (1735) to 2,400 pages in the [[12th edition of Systema Naturae|12th edition]] (1766–1768).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Londa |last=Schiebinger |date=April 1993 |title=Why mammals are called mammals: gender politics in eighteenth-century natural history |journal=[[The American Historical Review]] |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=382–411 |jstor=2166840 |pmid=11623150 |url=http://courses.csusm.edu/hist460ae/whymamallsarecalled%20mammals.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002172030/http://courses.csusm.edu/hist460ae/whymamallsarecalled%20mammals.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-02 |doi=10.2307/2166840 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as the work progressed, he made changes: in the first edition, [[whale]]s were classified as [[fish]]es, following the work of Linnaeus' friend and "father of [[ichthyology]]" [[Peter Artedi]]; in the 10th edition, published in 1758, [[whale]]s were moved into the [[mammal]] class. In this same edition, he introduced two-part names (see [[binomen]]) for animal species, something that he had done for plant species (see [[binary name]]) in the 1753 publication of ''{{Lang|la|[[Species Plantarum]]}}''. The system eventually developed into modern [[Linnaean taxonomy]], a hierarchically organized [[biological classification]].

After Linnaeus' health declined in the early 1770s, publication of editions of ''Systema Naturae'' went in two directions. Another Swedish scientist, [[Johan Andreas Murray]] issued the ''Regnum Vegetabile'' section separately in 1774 as the ''[[Systema Vegetabilium]]'', rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition.{{sfn|Linné|1774}} Meanwhile, a 13th edition of the entire ''Systema'' appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793. It was as the ''Systema Vegetabilium'' that Linnaeus' work became widely known in England following translation from the Latin by the [[Lichfield Botanical Society]], as ''A System of Vegetables'' (1783–1785).{{sfn|Linné|1785}}

== Taxonomy ==
In his ''{{Lang|la|Imperium Naturæ}}'', Linnaeus established three kingdoms, namely ''{{Lang|la|Regnum Animale}}'', ''{{Lang|la|Regnum Vegetabile}}'' and ''{{Lang|la|Regnum Lapideum}}''. This approach, the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms, survives until today in the popular mind, notably in the form of parlour games: "Is it [[animal, vegetable or mineral]]?" The classification was based on five levels: [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[genus]], and [[species]]. While species and genus was seen as God-given (or "natural"), the three higher levels were seen by Linnaeus as constructs. The concept behind the set ranks being applied to all groups was to make a system that was easy to remember and navigate, a task which most say he succeeded in.

[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|upright=1.9|The 1735 classification of animals]]
Linnaeus's work had a huge impact on science; it was indispensable as a foundation for [[biological nomenclature]], now regulated by the [[Nomenclature Codes]]. Two of his works, the first edition of the ''{{Lang|la|[[Species Plantarum]]}}'' (1753) for plants and the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of the ''Systema Naturæ'']] (1758), are accepted to be among the starting points of nomenclature. Most of his names for species and genera were published at very early dates, and thus take priority over those of other, later authors. In zoology there is one exception, which is a monograph on Swedish spiders, ''{{Lang|sv|[[Svenska Spindlar]]}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clerck |first=C. |author-link=Carl Alexander Clerck |year=1757 |title=Svenska Spindlar / Aranei Svecici |pages=[1–8], 1–154, pl. 1–6 |location=[[Stockholm]] |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN367246287}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Carl Clerck]] in 1757, so the names established there take priority over the Linnean names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code] Art. 3.1&lt;/ref&gt; His exceptional importance to science was less in the value of his taxonomy, more his deployment of skillful young students abroad to collect specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sörlin |first1=Sverker |last2=Fagerstedt |first2=Otto |year=2004 |title=Linné och hans apostlar |trans-title=Linnaeus and his apostles |language=sv |publisher=[[Natur &amp; Kultur]]/Fakta |location=Örebro, Sweden |isbn=978-91-27-35590-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the 18th century, his system had effectively become the standard for biological classification.

=== Animals ===
Only in the animal kingdom is the higher taxonomy of Linnaeus still more or less recognizable and some of these names are still in use, but usually not quite for the same groups as used by Linnaeus. He divided the Animal Kingdom into six classes; in the tenth edition (1758), these were:

#'''[[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Mammalia]]''' comprised the [[mammal]]s. In the first edition, [[Cetacea|whales]] and the [[West Indian manatee]] were classified among the fishes.
#'''[[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aves]]''' comprised the [[bird]]s. Linnaeus was the first to remove [[bat]]s from the birds and classify them under mammals.
#'''[[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Amphibia]]''' comprised [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, and assorted fishes that are not of [[Osteichthyes]].
#'''[[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Pisces]]''' comprised the [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]]. These included the spiny-finned fishes ([[Perciformes]]) as a separate order.
#'''[[Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Insecta]]''' comprised all [[arthropod]]s. [[Crustacean]]s, [[arachnid]]s and [[myriapod]]s were included as the order "Aptera".
#'''[[Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Vermes]]''' comprised the remaining [[invertebrate]]s, roughly divided into "worms", [[Mollusca|molluscs]], and hard-shelled organisms like [[echinoderm]]s.

=== Plants ===
The orders and classes of plants, according to his ''{{Lang|la|Systema Sexuale}}'', were never intended to represent natural groups (as opposed to his ''{{Lang|la|[[ordo naturalis|ordines naturales]]}}'' in his ''{{Lang|la|Philosophia Botanica}}'') but only for use in identification. They were used in that sense well into the 19th century.
[[File:SN-p837.jpg|thumb|upright|Key to the Sexual System from the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th (1758) edition]] of ''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturæ}}'']]
The Linnaean classes for plants, in the Sexual System, were:
{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
* Classis 1. [[Monandria]]
* Classis 2. [[Diandria]]
* Classis 3. [[Triandria (plant group)|Triandria]]
* Classis 4. [[Tetrandria]]
* Classis 5. [[Pentandria]]
* Classis 6. [[Hexandria]]
* Classis 7. [[Heptandria]]
* Classis 8. [[Octandria]]
* Classis 9. [[Enneandria]]
* Classis 10. [[Decandria]]
* Classis 11. [[Dodecandria]]
* Classis 12. [[Icosandria]]
* Classis 13. [[Polyandra (plant group)|Polyandra]]
* Classis 14. [[Didynamia]]
* Classis 15. [[Tetradynamia]]
* Classis 16. [[Monadelphia]]
* Classis 17. [[Diadelphia]]
* Classis 18. [[Polyadelphia]]
* Classis 19. [[Syngenesia]]
* Classis 20. [[Gynandria (plant group)|Gynandria]]
* Classis 21. [[Monoecia]]
* Classis 22. [[Dioecia]]
* Classis 23. [[Polygamia]]
* Classis 24. [[Cryptogam]]ia
{{div col end}}

=== Minerals ===
Linnaeus's taxonomy of [[minerals]] has long since fallen out of use. In the 10th edition, 1758, of the ''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturæ}}'', the Linnaean classes were:

* Classis 1. Petræ ([[Rock (geology)|rocks]])
* Classis 2. Mineræ ([[mineral]]s and [[ore]]s)
* Classis 3. Fossilia ([[fossil]]s and [[sediments|aggregates]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/history/mineralog.html |title=Linnaeus as a mineralogist &lt;!-- website spelling corrected --&gt; |work=Linné on line |publisher=[[Uppsala University]] |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==

Gmelin's thirteenth (''decima tertia'') edition of  ''Systema Naturae'' (1788–1793) should be carefully distinguished from the more limited  ''Systema Vegetabilium'' first prepared and published  by [[Johan Andreas Murray]] in 1774 (but labelled as "thirteenth edition").{{sfn|Linné|1774}}

The '''''Systematic census of Australian plants, with chronologic, literary and geographic annotations''''', more commonly known as the '''''Systematic Census of Australian Plants''''', also known by its standard botanic abbreviation '''''Syst. Census Austral. Pl.''''',&lt;ref name="IPNI"&gt;{{cite web | title = Systematic census of Australian plants … | work = [[IPNI]] | url = http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPublicationSearch.do?id=5805-2 | accessdate = 2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a survey of the [[vascular plant|vascular]] [[flora of Australia]] prepared by Government [[botanist]] for the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] and published in 1882.

Von Mueller describes the development of the census in the preface of the volume as an extension of the seven volumes of the ''[[Flora Australiensis]]'' written by [[George Bentham]]. A new flora was necessary since as more areas of Australia were explored and settled, the flora of the [[Australia (continent)|island-continent]] became better collected and described. The first census increased the number of described species from the 8125 in ''Flora Australiensis'' to 8646.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"/&gt; The book records all the known species indigenous to Australia and [[Norfolk Island]]; with records of species distribution. 

Von Mueller noted that by 1882 it had become difficult to distinguish some introduced species from native ones:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The lines of demarkation between truly indigenous and more recently immigrated plants can no longer in all cases be drawn with precision; but whereas ''[[Alchemilla vulgaris]]'' and ''[[Veronica serpyllifolia]]'' were found along with several European Carices in untrodden parts of the [[Australian Alps]] during the author's earliest explorations, ''[[Alchemilla arvensis]]'' and ''[[Veronica peregrina]]'' were at first only noticed near settlements. The occurrence of ''[[Arabis glabra]]'', ''[[Geum urbanum]]'', ''[[Agiimonia eupatoria]]'', ''[[Eupatorium cannabinum]]'', ''[[Cavpesium cernuum]]'' and some others may therefore readily be disputed as indigenous, and some questions concerning the nativity of various of our plants will probably remain for ever involved in doubts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mueller, F. | year = 1882 | title = Systematic census of Australian plants | url = https://archive.org/details/systematiccensus01mueluoft | publisher = Victorian Government | authorlink = Ferdinand von Mueller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1889 an updated edition of the census was published, the ''Second Systematic Census'' increased the number of described species to 8839.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"&gt;Orchard, A. E. 1999. Introduction. In A. E. Orchard, ed. ''Flora of Australia - Volume 1'', 2nd edition pp 1-9. Australian Biological Resources Study {{ISBN|0-643-05965-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Mueller dedicated both works to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[A. P. de Candolle]].

The work is of historic significance as the first Australian flora written in Australia. Following its publication, research and writing on the flora of Australia has largely been carried out in Australia.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"/&gt;

[[File:Phylogenetics.svg|thumb|400px|A comparison of phylogenetic and phenetic (character-based) concepts]]
Biological '''systematics''' is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the [[Correlation and dependence|relationships]] among living things through time. Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: [[cladograms]], [[phylogenetic tree]]s, phylogenies).  Phylogenies have two components: branching order (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of evolution).  Phylogenetic trees of species and higher [[taxa]] are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms ([[biogeography]]). Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

The word systematics is derived from the Latin word ''[[wikt:systema#Latin|systema]],'' which means systematic arrangement of organisms. [[Carl Linnaeus]] used '[[Systema Naturae]]' as the title of his book.

==Branches and applications==
In the study of biological systematics, researchers use the different branches to further understand the relationships between differing organisms. These branches are used to determine the applications and uses for modern day systematics.

Biological systematics classifies species by using three specific branches. ''Numerical systematics'', or ''biometry'', uses biological statistics to identify and classify animals. ''Biochemical systematics'' classifies and identifies animals based on the analysis of the material that makes up the living part of a cell—such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[organelle]]s, and [[cytoplasm]]. ''Experimental systematics'' identifies and classifies animals based on the evolutionary units that comprise a species, as well as their importance in evolution itself. Factors such as mutations, genetic divergence, and hybridization all are considered evolutionary units.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/systematics-meaning-branches-and-its-application/32374|title=Systematics: Meaning, Branches and Its Application|date=2016-05-27|work=Biology Discussion|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the specific branches, researchers are able to determine the applications and uses for modern-day systematics. These applications include:   
* Studying the diversity of organisms and the differentiation between extinct and living creatures. Biologists study the well-understood relationships by making many different diagrams and "trees" (cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies, etc.).   
* Including the scientific names of organisms, species descriptions and overviews, taxonomic orders, and classifications of evolutionary and organism histories.
* Explaining the biodiversity of the planet and its organisms. The systematic study is that of conservation. 
* Manipulating and controlling the natural world. This includes the practice of 'biological control', the intentional introduction of natural predators and disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Definition and relation with taxonomy==

[[John Lindley]] provided an early definition of systematics in 1830, although he wrote of "systematic botany" rather than using the term "systematics".&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, J. S. ''[http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ What is systematics and what is taxonomy?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827124330/http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |date=2016-08-27 }}''. Available on http://evolvingthoughts.net&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970  Michener ''et al.'' defined "systematic biology" and "[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]" (terms that are often confused and used interchangeably) in relationship to one another as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Michener, Charles D., John O. Corliss, Richard S. Cowan, Peter H. Raven, Curtis W. Sabrosky, Donald S. Squires, and G. W. Wharton (1970). ''Systematics In Support of Biological Research''. Division of Biology and Agriculture, National Research Council. Washington, D.C. 25 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is the field that (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations. This is a field with a long history that in recent years has experienced a notable renaissance, principally with respect to theoretical content. Part of the theoretical material has to do with evolutionary areas (topics e and f above), the rest relates especially to the problem of classification. Taxonomy is that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "taxonomy" was coined by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] while the term "systematic" was coined by [[Carl Linnaeus]] the father of taxonomy. 

Taxonomy, systematic biology, systematics, biosystematics, scientific classification, biological classification, phylogenetics: At various times in history, all these words have had overlapping, related meanings.  However, in modern usage, they can all be considered synonyms of each other.

For example, Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary of 1987 treats "classification", "taxonomy", and "systematics" as synonyms. According to this work, the terms originated in 1790, c. 1828, and in 1888 respectively. Some{{who|date=July 2013}} claim systematics alone deals specifically with relationships through time, and that it can be synonymous with [[phylogenetics]], broadly dealing with the inferred hierarchy{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} of organisms.  This means it would be a subset of taxonomy as it is sometimes regarded, but the inverse is claimed by others.{{who|date=July 2013}}

Europeans tend to use the terms "systematics" and "biosystematics" for the study of biodiversity as a whole, whereas North Americans tend to use "taxonomy" more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Brusca, R. C., &amp; Brusca, G. J. (2003). Invertebrates (2nd ed.). Sunderland, Mass. : Sinauer Associates, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; However, taxonomy, and in particular [[alpha taxonomy]], is more specifically the identification, description, and naming (i.e. nomenclature) of organisms,&lt;ref name="Fortey"&gt;
{{Citation |last= Fortey |first= Richard |author-link= Richard Fortey 
|year=2008
|title= Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum |location= London 
|publisher= Harper Perennial |isbn= 978-0-00-720989-7 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
while "classification" focuses on placing organisms within hierarchical groups that show their relationships to other organisms.  All of these biological disciplines can deal with both [[extinct]] and [[extant taxon|extant]] organisms.

Systematics uses taxonomy as a primary tool in understanding, as nothing about an organism's relationships with other living things can be understood without it first being properly studied and described in sufficient detail to identify and classify it correctly.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Scientific classifications are aids in recording and reporting information to other scientists and to laymen.  The '''systematist''', a scientist who specializes in systematics, must, therefore, be able to use existing classification systems, or at least know them well enough to skilfully justify not using them.

[[Phenetics]] was an attempt to determine the relationships of organisms through a measure of overall similarity, making no distinction between [[plesiomorph]]ies (shared ancestral traits) and [[apomorph]]ies (derived traits). From the late-20th century onwards, it was superseded by [[cladistics]], which rejects plesiomorphies in attempting to resolve the [[phylogeny]] of Earth's various organisms through time.  {{As of | 2014 | alt = Today's}} systematists generally make extensive use of [[molecular biology]] and of [[computer programs]] to study organisms.

==Taxonomic characters==
Taxonomic characters are the taxonomic attributes that can be used to provide the evidence from which relationships (the [[phylogeny]]) between taxa  are inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1991). Principles of Systematic Zoology. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinds of taxonomic characters include:&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1991), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="4306" xml:space="preserve">'''TA cloning''' (also known as '''rapid cloning''' or '''T cloning''') is a [[subcloning]] technique that avoids the use of [[restriction enzymes]]&lt;ref name="caister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caister.com/molecular-biology-blog/2009/06/improved-ta-cloning.html|title=Improved TA Cloning|publisher=Caister Academic Press|accessdate=2009-10-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708111710/http://www.caister.com/molecular-biology-blog/2009/06/improved-ta-cloning.html|archivedate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is easier and quicker than traditional subcloning. The technique relies on the ability of [[adenine]] (A) and [[thymine]] (T) (complementary basepairs) on different DNA fragments to hybridize and, in the presence of [[DNA ligase|ligase]], become ligated together. [[PCR]] products are usually amplified using [[Taq polymerase|Taq DNA polymerase]] which preferentially adds an adenine to the 3' end of the product. Such PCR amplified inserts are cloned into linearized [[Plasmid#Vectors|vectors]] that have complementary 3' [[thymine]] overhangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/TA_Cloning.html|title=TA Cloning|website=www.premierbiosoft.com|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
[[File:tacloning.svg|thumb|400px|alt=Diagram of TA Cloning.|Diagram of TA Cloning.]]

===Creating the insert===
The insert is created by PCR using [[Taq polymerase]]. This polymerase lacks 3' to 5' proofreading activity and, with a high probability, adds a single, 3'-[[adenine]] overhang to each end of the PCR product. It is best if the PCR primers have [[guanine]]s at the 5' end as this maximizes probability of Taq DNA polymerase adding the terminal adenosine overhang.&lt;ref name="HCGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcgs.unh.edu/protocol/basic/Cltaclone.html|title=TA cloning protocol|publisher=Hubbart Center for Genomic Studies|accessdate=2009-10-17|location=Durham, New Hampshire, USA|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202013523/http://hcgs.unh.edu/protocol/basic/Cltaclone.html|archivedate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermostable polymerases containing extensive 3´ to 5´ exonuclease activity should not be used as they do not leave the 3´ adenine-overhangs.&lt;ref name="invitrogenmanual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanxterm.aecom.yu.edu/wiki/data/Product_manuals_attach/ta.pdf|title=TA Cloning Kit Manual|date=7 April 2004|publisher=Invitrogen|pages=31|accessdate=2009-10-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624165645/http://stanxterm.aecom.yu.edu/wiki/data/Product_manuals_attach/ta.pdf|archivedate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating the vector===
The target vector is linearized and cut with a blunt-end restriction enzyme. This vector is then tailed with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using [[terminal transferase]]. It is important to use ddTTP to ensure the addition of only one T residue. This tailing leaves the vector with a single 3'-overhanging thymine residue on each blunt end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/nar/19.5.1156|last=Holton|first=T.A.|author2=Graham, M.W |date=1991-03-11|title=A simple and efficient method for direct cloning of PCR products using ddT-tailed vectors|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1156|pmid=2020554|pmc=333802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers commonly sell TA Cloning "kits" with a wide range of prepared vectors that have already been linearized and tagged with an overhanging thymine.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Given that there is no need for restriction enzymes other than for generating the linearized vector, the procedure is much simpler and faster than traditional [[subcloning]]. There is also no need to add restriction sites when designing primers and thus shorter primers can be used saving time and money. In addition, in instances where there are no viable restriction sites that can be used for traditional cloning, TA cloning is often used as an alternative. The major downside of TA cloning is that directional cloning is not possible, so the gene has a 50% chance of getting cloned in the reverse direction.&lt;ref name="caister" /&gt;

Two hybrid promoters functional in ''Escherichia coli'' were constructed. These hybrid promoters, tacI and tacII, were derived from sequences of the trp and the lac UV5 promoters. In the first hybrid promoter (tacI), the DNA upstream of position –20 with respect to the transcriptional start site was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position –20 was derived from the lac UV5 promoter. In the second hybrid promoter (tacII), the DNA upstream of position –11 at the Hpa I site within the Pribnow box was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position –11 is a 46-base-pair synthetic DNA fragment that specifies part of the hybrid Pribnow box and the entire lac operator. It also specifies a Shine–Dalgarno sequence flanked by two unique restriction sites (portable Shine–Dalgarno sequence).

The tacI and the tacII promoters respectively direct transcription approximately 11 and 7 times more efficiently than the derepressed parental lac UV5 promoter and approximately 3 and 2 times more efficiently than the trp promoter in the absence of the trp repressor. Both hybrid promoters can be repressed by the lac repressor and both can be derepressed with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside. Consequently, these hybrid promoters are useful for the controlled expression of foreign genes at high levels in E. coli. In contrast to the trp and the lac UV5 promoters, the tacI promoter has not only a consensus –35 sequence but also a consensus [[Pribnow box]] sequence. This may explain the higher efficiency of this hybrid promoter with respect to either one of the parental promoters.&lt;ref name="de Boer 21–25"/&gt;

==About==
The tac promoter is used to control and increase the [[Gene expression|expression]] levels of a target gene and is used in the [[over-expression]] of [[recombinant proteins]]. The '''tac''' promoter is named after the two promoters which comprise its sequence: the ''''t'''rp' and the 'l'''ac'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' promoters.

Bacterial [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] consist of two parts, the '–35' region and the '–10' region (the [[Pribnow box]]). These two regions bind the [[sigma factor]] of [[RNA polymerase]], which then initiates [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the downstream gene. The tac promoter consists of the '–35' region of the [[Trp operon|trp promoter]] and the '–10' region of the [[Lac operon|lac promoter]] (and differs from a related trc promoter by 1 bp&lt;ref name="Brosius"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brosius|first=J.|date=1985-03-25|title=Spacing of the –10 and –35 regions in the tac promoter. Effect on its in vivo activity|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=260|issue=6|pages=3539–41|doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(19)83655-4|pmid=2579077|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The tac promoter is, therefore, [[Regulation of gene expression|inducible]] by [[Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside|IPTG]] (Isopropyl β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-1-thiogalactopyranoside), whilst also allowing higher maximum gene expression than either the lac or trp promoters. This makes it suitable for high-efficiency [[protein production]] of a recombinant protein.&lt;ref name="de Boer 21–25"/&gt; The strong repression of expression in the 'off' state is important since foreign proteins can be toxic to the host cell.

260(6):3539-41.

==Applications==
The tac promoter finds various applications. The tac promoter/operator (dubbed ''PTAC'') is one of the most widely used expression systems. Ptac is a strong hybrid promoter composed of the –35 region of the trp promoter and the –10 region of the lacUV5 promoter/operator. The expression of PTAC is repressed by the lacI protein. The lacI&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt; allele is a promoter mutation that increases the intracellular concentration of LacI repressor, resulting in the strong repression of PTAC. The addition of the inducer IPTG inactivates the LacI repressor. Thus, the amount of expression from PTAC is proportional to the concentration of IPTG added: low concentrations of IPTG result in relatively low expression from PTAC and high concentrations of IPTG result in high expression from PTAC. By varying the IPTG concentration the amount of gene product cloned downstream from PTAC can be varied over several orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Maloy, Professor, Dean, College of Sciences, Associate Director, Center for Microbial Sciences, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine. [http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/~smaloy/MicrobialGenetics/topics/in-vitro-genetics/expression-vectors.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=January 2019}} For example, the PTAC system is used for fusion protein expression within the PMAL-C2X expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Talimogene laherparepvec''', sold under the brand name '''Imlygic''', is a [[biopharmaceutical]] medication used to treat [[melanoma]] that cannot be operated on; it is injected directly into a subset of lesions which generates a systemic immune response against the recipient's cancer.&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev/&gt;  The final four year analysis from the pivotal phase 3 study upon which TVEC was approved by the FDA showed a 31.5% response rate with a 16.9% [[remission (medicine) |complete response]] (CR) rate. There was also a substantial and statistically significant survival benefit in patients with earlier metastatic disease (stages IIIb-IVM1a) and in patients who hadn't received prior systemic treatment for melanoma. The earlier stage group had a reduction in the risk of death of approximately 50% with one in four patients appearing to have met, or be close to be reaching, the medical definition of cure.&lt;ref name=Andtbacka2019&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andtbacka RH, Collichio F, Harrington KJ, Middleton MR, Downey G, Öhrling K, Kaufman HL | title = Final analyses of OPTiM: a randomized phase III trial of talimogene laherparepvec versus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in unresectable stage III-IV melanoma | journal = Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 145 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31171039 | pmc = 6554874 | doi = 10.1186/s40425-019-0623-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real world use of talimogene laherparepvec have shown response rates of up to 88.5% with CR rates of up to 61.5%.&lt;ref name="pmid30694555"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franke V, Berger DM, Klop WM, van der Hiel B, van de Wiel BA, Ter Meulen S, Wouters MW, van Houdt WJ, van Akkooi AC | title = High response rates for T-VEC in early metastatic melanoma (stage IIIB/C-IVM1a) | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 145 | issue = 4 | pages = 974–978 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 30694555 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.32172 | s2cid = 59340728 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around half of people treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials experienced fatigue and chills; around 40% had fever, around 35% had nausea, and around 30% had flu-like symptoms as well as pain at the injection site.

Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically engineered herpes virus (an [[oncolytic herpes virus]]). Two genes were removed – one that shuts down an individual cell's defenses, and another that helps the virus evade the immune system – and a gene for human [[GM-CSF]] was added.  The drug works by replicating in cancer cells, causing them to burst; it was also designed to stimulate an immune response against the patient's cancer, which has been demonstrated by multiple pieces of data, including regression of tumors which have not been injected with talimogene laherparepvec.&lt;ref name=Evans2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Around half of people treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials experienced fatigue and chills; around 40% had fever, around 35% had nausea, and around 30% had flu-like symptoms as well as pain at the injection site.  The reactions were mild to moderate in severity; 2% of people had severe reactions and these were generally [[cellulitis]].&lt;ref name=EMAlabel/&gt;

More than 10% of people had [[edema]], headache, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, muscle pain, or joint pain.  Between 1% and 10% developed cold sores, pain or infection in the lesion, [[anemia]], immune mediated events (like vasculitis, pneumonia, worsening psoriasis, glomerulonephritis and [[vitiligo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrington KJ, Michielin O, Malvehy J, Pezzani Grüter I, Grove L, Frauchiger AL, Dummer R | title = A practical guide to the handling and administration of talimogene laherparepvec in Europe | journal = OncoTargets and Therapy | volume = 10 | pages = 3867–3880 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28814886 | pmc = 5546812 | doi = 10.2147/OTT.S133699 | id = 101514322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ), dehydration, confusion, anxiety, depression, dizziness, insomnia, ear pain, [[tachycardia|fast heart beating]], [[deep vein thrombosis]], high blood pressure, flushing, shortness of breath when exercising, sore throat, symptoms of the [[common cold]], stomach pain, back pain, groin pain, weight loss, or oozing from the injection site.&lt;ref name=EMAlabel/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Talimogene laherparepvec is taken up by normal cells and cancer cells like the wild type [[herpes simplex virus]], it is cleared in the same way.&lt;ref name=EMAlabel/&gt;

==Mechanism==
Talimogene laherparepvec directly destroys the cancer cells it infects, inducing a systemic immune response against the patient's cancer.&lt;ref name=Evans2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev/&gt;

The virus invades both cancerous and healthy cells, but it cannot productively replicate in healthy tissue because it lacks [[Infected cell protein 34.5]] (ICP34.5).  When cells are infected with a virus they shut down and die, but ICP34.5 blocks this [[cellular stress response|stress response]], allowing the virus to hijack the cell's [[Translation (biology)|translation]] machinery to replicate itself. A herpesvirus lacking the gene coding for ICP34.5 cannot replicate in normal tissue. However, in many cancer cells the stress response is already disrupted, so a virus lacking ICP34.5 can still replicate in tumors.   After the virus has replicated many times, the cell swells and finally bursts, killing the cell and releasing the copies of the virus, which can then infect nearby cells.&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwalla2012rev&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Agarwalla PK, Aghi MK | title = Oncolytic Viruses | chapter = Oncolytic herpes simplex virus engineering and preparation | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 797 | pages = 1–19 | date = 2012 | pmid = 21948465 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-340-0_1 | isbn = 978-1-61779-339-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While talimogene laherparepvec is using the cell's translation machinery to replicate, it also uses it to make the cell create [[GM-CSF]].  GM-CSF  is secreted or released when the cancer cell bursts, attracting [[dendritic cells]] to the site, which pick up the tumor antigens, process them, and then present them on their surface to [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic (killer) T cells]] which in turn sets off an immune response.&lt;ref name=Evans2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev/&gt;

==Composition==
Talimogene laherparepvec is a [[biopharmaceutical]] drug; it is an [[oncolytic herpes virus]] that was created by [[genetic engineering|genetically engineering]] a strain of [[herpes simplex virus 1]] (HSV-1) taken from a person infected with the virus, rather than a laboratory strain.&lt;ref name=Evans2016rev/&gt;  Both copies of the viral gene coding for [[Infected cell protein 34.5|ICP34.5]] were deleted and replaced with the gene coding for human [[GM-CSF]], and the gene coding for [[Infected cell protein 47|ICP47]] was removed.&lt;ref name=Evans2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fukuhara H, Ino Y, Todo T | title = Oncolytic virus therapy: A new era of cancer treatment at dawn | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 107 | issue = 10 | pages = 1373–1379 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27486853 | pmc = 5084676 | doi = 10.1111/cas.13027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu BL, Robinson M, Han ZQ, Branston RH, English C, Reay P, McGrath Y, Thomas SK, Thornton M, Bullock P, Love CA, Coffin RS | display-authors = 6 | title = ICP34.5 deleted herpes simplex virus with enhanced oncolytic, immune stimulating, and anti-tumour properties | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 292–303 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12595888 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3301885 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In wild herpes virus, ICP47 suppresses the immune response to the virus; it was removed because the drug was designed with the intention of activating the immune system.&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev/&gt;

==History==
The first oncolytic virus to be approved by a regulatory agency was a genetically modified adenovirus named [[H101 virus|H101]] by Shanghai Sunway Biotech. It gained regulatory approval in 2005 from China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid16507823"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garber K | title = China approves world's first oncolytic virus therapy for cancer treatment | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 298–300 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16507823 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djj111 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Talimogene laherparepvec is the world's first approved oncolytic immunotherapy, i.e. it was also designed to provide systemic anti-tumor effects through the induction of an anti-tumor immune response.

      <text bytes="8890" xml:space="preserve">A '''tandem mass tag''' ('''TMT''') is a chemical label that facilitates sample multiplexing in [[mass spectrometry]] (MS)-based quantification and identification of biological [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s, [[peptides]] and [[nucleic acids]]. TMT belongs to a family of reagents referred to as [[isobaric labeling|isobaric mass tags]] which are a set of molecules with the same mass, but yield reporter ions of differing mass after fragmentation. The relative ratio of the measured reporter ions represents the relative abundance of the tagged molecule, although ion suppression has a detrimental effect on accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Brien JJ, O'Connell JD, Paulo JA, Thakurta S, Rose CM, Weekes MP, Huttlin EL, Gygi SP | display-authors = 6 | title = Compositional Proteomics: Effects of Spatial Constraints on Protein Quantification Utilizing Isobaric Tags | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 590–599 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29195270 | pmc = 5806995 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenes A, Hukelmann J, Bensaddek D, Lamond AI | title = Multibatch TMT Reveals False Positives, Batch Effects and Missing Values | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 18 | issue = 10 | pages = 1967–1980 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31332098 | pmc = 6773557 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.RA119.001472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these complications, TMT-based proteomics has been shown to afford higher precision than [[Label-free quantification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connell JD, Paulo JA, O'Brien JJ, Gygi SP | title = Proteome-Wide Evaluation of Two Common Protein Quantification Methods | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 1934–1942 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29635916 | pmc = 5984592 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to aiding in protein quantification, TMT tags can also increase the detection sensitivity of certain highly hydrophilic analytes, such as phosphopeptides, in [[Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography|RPLC]]-MS analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai CF, Smith JS, Krajewski K, Zhao R, Moghieb AM, Nicora CD, Xiong X, Moore RJ, Liu T, Smith RD, Jacobs JM, Rajagopal S, Shi T | display-authors = 6 | title = Tandem Mass Tag Labeling Facilitates Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Hydrophilic Phosphopeptides | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 91 | issue = 18 | pages = 11606–11613 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31418558 | pmc = 7197904 | doi = 10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tags contain four regions, namely a mass reporter region (M), a cleavable linker region (F), a mass normalization region (N) and a protein reactive group (R). The chemical structures of all the tags are identical but each contains [[isotopes]] substituted at various positions, such that the mass reporter and mass normalization regions have different [[molecular mass]]es in each tag. The combined M-F-N-R regions of the tags have the same total molecular weights and structure so that during [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] or [[Gel electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation and in single MS mode, molecules labelled with different tags are indistinguishable. Upon fragmentation in [[Tandem mass spectrometry#Tandem MS (MS/MS)|MS/MS]] mode, sequence information is obtained from fragmentation of the [[Peptide bond|peptide back bone]] and quantification data are simultaneously obtained from fragmentation of the tags, giving rise to mass reporter ions.

== Quantification of labeled peptides ==

The [[Chemical structure|structures]] of TMT tags are publicly available through the unimod database at unimod.org and hence, [[mass spectrometry software]] such as [[Mascot (software)|Mascot]] are able to account for the tag masses. Additionally, as of version 2.2, [[Mascot (software)|Mascot]] has the capability to quantify using TMT and other isobaric mass tags without the use of additional software.  Intuitively, the trust associated with a protein measurement depends on the similarity of ratios from different peptides and the signal level of these measurements. A mathematically rigorous approach called BACIQ, that integrates peptide intensities and peptide-measurement agreement into confidence intervals for protein ratios has emerged.&lt;ref name="Peshkin"&gt;{{cite bioRxiv|last1=Peshkin|first1=L.|last2=Ryazanova|first2=L.|last3=Wuhr|first3=M.|title=Bayesian Confidence Intervals for Multiplexed Proteomics Integrate Ion-Statistics with Peptide Quantification Concordance|date=2017|display-authors=etal|biorxiv=10.1101/210476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TKO standard can be used to assess interference &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paulo JA, O'Connell JD, Gygi SP | title = A Triple Knockout (TKO) Proteomics Standard for Diagnosing Ion Interference in Isobaric Labeling Experiments | journal = Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume = 27 | issue = 10 | pages = 1620–5 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27400695 | pmc = 5018445 | doi = 10.1007/s13361-016-1434-9 | bibcode = 2016JASMS..27.1620P }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=February 2019}}

A '''taphotaxon''' (from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ταφος, ''taphos'' meaning ''burial'' and ταξις, ''taxis'' meaning ''ordering'') is an invalid [[taxon]] based on fossils remains that have been altered in a characteristic way during burial and [[diagenesis]]. The fossils so altered have distinctive characteristics that make them appear to be a new taxon, but these characteristics are spurious and do not reflect any significant taxonomic distinction from an existing fossil taxon. The term was first proposed by [[Spencer G. Lucas]] in 2001, who particularly applied it to spurious [[ichnotaxon]]s,&lt;ref name=Lucas2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lucas |first1=Spencer G. |title=Taphotaxon |journal=Lethaia |date=2001 |volume=34 |page=30 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/002411601300068198 |access-date=19 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marchetti |first1=Lorenzo |last2=Voigt |first2=Sebastian |last3=Lucas |first3=Spencer G. |title=An anatomy-consistent study of the Lopingian eolian tracks of Germany and Scotland reveals the first evidence of the end-Guadalupian mass extinction at low paleolatitudes of Pangea |journal=Gondwana Research |date=September 2019 |volume=73 |pages=32–53 |doi=10.1016/j.gr.2019.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has since been applied to body fossils such as ''Nuia'' (interpreted as cylindrical [[oncolite]]s formed around filamentous [[cyanobacteria]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vachard |first1=Daniel |last2=Clausen |first2=Sébastien |last3=Palafox |first3=Juan José |last4=Buitrón |first4=Blanca Estela |last5=Devaere |first5=Léa |last6=Hayart |first6=Valentin |last7=Régnier |first7=Sylvie |title=Lower Ordovician microfacies and microfossils from Cerro San Pedro (San Pedro de la Cueva, Sonora, Mexico), as a westernmost outcrop of the newly defined Nuia Province |journal=Facies |date=July 2017 |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=18 |doi=10.1007/s10347-017-0497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Ivanovia]]'' (thought to be a taphotaxon of ''[[Anchicondium]] '' or ''[[Eugonophyllum]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corrochano |first1=Diego |last2=Vachard |first2=Daniel |title=Remarks on the Cortical Structure of Late Paleozoic “Phylloid Algae” |journal=Journal of Paleontology |date=September 2014 |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=1019–1030 |doi=10.1017/S0022336000057620}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[conulariid]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Some Middle Paleozoic conulariids (Cnidaria) as possible examples of taphonomic artifacts |first1=Marcello |last1=Simoes

In his original definition of the term, Lucas emphasized that he was not seeking to create a new field of taphotaxonomy. The term is intended simply as a useful description of a particular type of invalid taxon.&lt;ref name=Lucas2001/&gt; It should not be used indiscriminately, particularly with ichnotaxons, where the fact that an ichnotaxon derives part of its morphology from taphonomic processes may not always render it an invalid ichnotaxon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macnaughton |first1=Robert B. |last2=Pickerill |first2=Ron K. |title=Taphonomy and the taxonomy of trace fossils: a commentary |journal=Lethaia |date=2003 |volume=36 |pages=66-70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alpine vegetation of Tasmania|vegetation in Tasmania's alpine environments]] is predominately woody and shrub-like.

== Distribution ==
These coniferous shrub species are restricted to subalpine and alpine heathlands in western Tasmania, with the exception of ''Podocarpus lawrencei'' which lives on the mainland.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The alpine environments where these conifers occur have high levels of conifer [[endemism]], which is an ecologically habitat for coniferous shrub species.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/conservation/flora-of-tasmania/native-plant-species/native-conifers-of-western-tasmania|title=Native Conifers of Western Tasmania|date=26 September 2016|website=Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coniferous shrub species can be observed in [[Mount Field National Park]] in Tasmania's south west along the Tarn Shelf. All species can be observed in rocky environments with shallow soil above {{cvt|1000|meter}}.

== Ecology ==
Both the alpine environment and the harsh [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; have the pressures and limitations of wind exposure and ice abrasion for the woody and shrub-like habit of coniferous shrubbery. The lack of protective snow cover on Tasmanian mountains means that vegetation must be mechanically resistant to these elements, hence an ecologically habitat for coniferous shrub species. This is contrasted to alps of mainland Australia or New Zealand, where the presence of prolonged snow lie lead to the development of a grassland-herbland vegetation community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Low productivity of the environment is indicated through the slow growth habit of the conifers, and the effects of fire are detrimental to the species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As well as this, physiological drought intolerance in conifers could influence the growth of vegetation considering the changing climate.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Fitzgerald, N. (2011). ''Establishment Report for Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Climate Change Monitoring Program: Montane Conifers.'' Resource Management and Conservation Division, DPIPWE, Hobart, Nature Conservation Report Series 11/06&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic pattern of distribution is due to both fire history and the influence of precipitation and temperature.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The exceptionally high species richness in subalpine vegetation is caused by this mosaic of vegetation communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Paleoendemism ==
The alpine vegetation of western Tasmania is associated with paleoendemic species, i.e. species that are old and geographically confined. ''Microchachry''s'','' ''Pherosphaera'' and ''Diselma'' are paleoendemic coniferous shrub clades of alpine western Tasmania. These clades were found on other southern hemisphere continents according to fossil, and they are restricted in their distribution. The environment they inhabit currently is not productive with infrequent fire, which is evident through the short and open canopy structure of the vegetation. Distribution of paleoendemic species gives insight into the similarities to environments in which ancestral lineages occurred and the current environmental characteristics allowing the species survival. Persistence of these species is due to natural selection, not dispersal limitation. The conservation of certain ecological characteristics promotes survival. The table below shows clade ages and scores of paleoendemism, which are calculated by dividing the age of the clade by the square root of the area of current occupancy. Scores of &gt;500 m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; are considered high.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Threats==
Tasmania is one of 5 global hotspots for conifer diversity, with one of the highest rates of endemism in conifer flora in the world. The threats of climate change to Tasmanian coniferous shrubbery exist. Physical intolerance to drought and fire sensitivity are characteristic of the conifers and potential for distribution and recolonization is limited by ways of seed dispersal and slow growth rates.

In Tasmania, climate change is a rise in mean annual temperature, changed rainfall seasonality and weather events such as drought and fire. Dry lightning and drier soil conditions in western Tasmania pose a threat to coniferous shrubbery and other alpine vegetation types. The probability that extreme weather events cause that the extinction of species is higher than the effects of rise in temperature or rainfall.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Conservation  ==
For conservation of the Tasmanian coniferous shrubbery species, monitoring and prediction of climate events and refugia are fundamental. Field surveys and aerial photograph monitoring is in place in order to collect the required information.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In order to reduce the risk of fire, 'fuel stove only areas' have been implemented in the [http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=391 Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area], where the majority of Tasmanian coniferous shrubbery is located. These measures have been introduced in the hope of preventing the loss of conifer populations in both rainforest and alpine communities and to promote their survival into the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; That happens when rapid evolution makes a new species appear so radically different from the ancestral group that it is not (initially) recognised as belonging to the parent [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] group, which is left as an [[evolutionary grade]].

While the term is from bacteriology, parallel examples are found throughout the [[tree of life (science)|tree of life]]. For example, [[tetrapoda|four-footed animals]] have evolved from piscine ancestors but since they are not generally considered [[fish]], they can be said to be "fish in disguise".

In many cases, the paraphyly can be resolved by reclassifying the taxon in question under the parent group. However, in bacteriology, since renaming groups may have serious consequences since by causing confusion over the identity of [[pathogen]]s, it is generally avoided for some groups.

==Examples==

=== ''Shigella'' ===

The bacterial genus ''[[Shigella]]'' is the cause of [[shigellosis|bacillary dysentery]], a potentially-severe infection that kills over a million people every year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060326210705/http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index6.html World Health Organization. Shigellosis.]&lt;/ref&gt; The genus (''[[Shigella dysenteriae|S. dysenteriae]]'', ''[[Shigella flexneri|S. flexneri]]'', ''[[Shigella boydii|S. boydii]]'', ''[[Shigella sonnei|S. sonnei]]'') have evolved from the common intestinal bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', which renders that species paraphyletic. ''E. coli'' itself can also cause serious dysentery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tauschek M, Gorrell R, Robins-Browne RM |title=Identification of a protein secretory pathway for the secretion of heat-labile enterotoxin by an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli | journal=PNAS | volume=99 |pages=7066–71 | pmid = 12011463 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.092152899 | issue=10 | pmc=124529 | date=May 2002|bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7066T |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; but differences in genetic makeup between ''E. coli'' and ''Shigella'' cause different medical conditions and symptoms.&lt;ref name="shigella"/&gt;

''Escherichia coli'' is a badly-classified species since some strains share only 20% of their genome. It is so diverse that it should be given a higher taxonomic ranking. However, medical conditions associated with ''E. coli'' itself and ''Shigella'' make the current classification not to be changed to avoid confusion in medical context. ''Shigella'' will thus remain "''E. coli'' in disguise".

=== ''B. cereus''-group ===

Similarly, the ''[[Bacillus]]'' species of the ''B. cereus''-group (''[[Bacillus anthracis|B. anthracis]]'', ''[[Bacillus cereus|B. cereus]]'', ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis|B . thuringiensis]]'', ''[[Bacillus mycoides|B. mycoides]]'', ''[[Bacillus pseudomycoides|B. pseudomycoides]]'', ''[[Bacillus weihenstephanensis|B. weihenstephanensis]]'' and ''[[Bacillus medusa|B. medusa]]'') have 99-100% similar 16S rRNA sequence (97% is a commonly-cited adequate species limit) and should be considered a single species.&lt;ref name=Bacillus&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Elephants in Kenya.jpg|thumb|270px|[[African elephant]]s form the [[genus]] ''Loxodonta'', a widely accepted taxon.]]

In [[biology]], a '''taxon''' ([[back-formation]] from ''[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]''; plural '''taxa''') is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular [[Taxonomic rank|ranking]], especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is very common, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal [[scientific name]], its use is then governed by one of the [[nomenclature codes]] specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.

Initial attempts at classifying and ordering organisms (plants and animals) were set forth in [[Carl Linnaeus]]'s [[Linnaean taxonomy|system]] in ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th edition (1758),&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Quammen |first=David |title=A Passion for Order |publisher=National Geographic Magazine |date=June 2007 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2007/06/linnaeus-name-giver/david-quammen-text |access-date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ENDRef--&gt; as well as an unpublished work by [[Bernard de Jussieu|Bernard]] and [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]].  The idea of a unit-based system of biological classification was first made widely available in 1805 in the introduction of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''Flore françoise'', and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]]'s ''Principes élémentaires de botanique''. Lamarck set out a system for the "natural classification" of plants. Since then, [[Systematics|systematists]] continue to construct accurate classifications encompassing the diversity of life; today, a "good" or "useful" taxon is commonly taken to be one that reflects [[Phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]].{{NoteTag|This is not considered as mandatory, however, as indicated by terms for non-[[Monophyly|monophyletic]] groupings ("invertebrates", "conifers", "fish", etc).}}

Many modern systematists, such as advocates of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], use [[Cladistics|cladistic]] methods that require taxa to be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] (all descendants of some ancestor). Their basic unit, therefore, the [[clade]] is equivalent to the taxon, assuming that taxa should reflect evolutionary relationships. Similarly, among those contemporary taxonomists working with the traditional Linnean (binomial) nomenclature, few propose taxa they know to be [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Phylogeny as a Central Principle in Taxonomy: Phylogenetic Definitions of Taxon Names |author=de Queiroz, K &amp; J Gauthier |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=39 |issue=4 |year=1990 |pages=307–322 |url=http://vertebrates.si.edu/herps/herps_pdfs/deQueiroz_pdfs/1990deQ_GauSZ.pdf |doi=10.2307/2992353 |jstor=2992353}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a long-established taxon that is not also a clade is the [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Reptile|Reptilia]], the reptiles; birds and mammals are the descendants of animals traditionally classed as reptiles, but neither are included in the Reptilia (birds are traditionally placed in the class [[Bird|Aves]], and mammals in the class [[Mammal|Mammalia]]).&lt;ref name=Romer&gt;{{cite book |last=Romer |first=A.

== History ==
The term ''taxon'' was first used in 1926 by [[:de:Adolf Meyer-Abich|Adolf Meyer-Abich]] for animal groups, as a back-formation from the word [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; the word ''taxonomy'' had been coined a century before from the Greek components ''[[wiktionary:τάξις|τάξις]]'' (''taxis'', meaning arrangement) and ''[[wiktionary:νόμος|-νομία]]'' ([[:wikt:-nomy|''-nomia'']] meaning [[Scientific method|method]]).&lt;ref name="AdnetSenut2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sylvain Adnet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUz8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 |title=Principes de paléontologie |author2=[[Brigitte Senut]] |author3=Thierry Tortosa |author4=Romain Amiot, Julien Claude, Sébastien Clausen, Anne-Laure Decombeix, Vincent Fernandez, Grégoire Métais, Brigitte Meyer-Berthaud, Serge Muller |date=25 September 2013 |publisher=Dunod |isbn=978-2-10-070313-5 |pages=122 |quote=La taxinomie s'enrichit avec l'invenition du mot «taxon» par Adolf Meyer-Abich, naturaliste allemand, dans sa Logik der morphologie, im Rahmen einer Logik der gesamten Biologie (1926) [Translation: Taxonomy is enriched by the invention of the word "taxon" by Adolf Meyer-Abich, German naturalist, in his Logik der morphologie, im Rahmen einer Logik der gesamten Biologie (1926).]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer-Abich|first=Adolf|title=Logik der Morphologie im Rahmen einer Logik der gesamten Biologie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8miBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|year=1926|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-642-50733-5|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; For plants, it was proposed by [[Herman Johannes Lam]] in 1948, and it was adopted at the VII [[International Botanical Congress]], held in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Naik, V.

A taxon encompasses all included taxa of lower rank (q.v.) and individual organisms. [...]"

== Ranks ==
{{Biological classification}}

A taxon can be assigned a [[taxonomic rank]], usually (but not necessarily) when it is given a formal name.

"[[Phylum]]" applies formally to any biological [[domain (biology)|domain]], but traditionally it was always used for animals, whereas "division" was traditionally often used for [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], etc.

A prefix is used to indicate a ranking of lesser importance. The prefix ''super-'' indicates a rank above, the prefix ''sub-'' indicates a rank below. In [[zoology]], the prefix ''infra-'' indicates a rank below ''sub-''.  For instance, among the additional ranks of [[Class (biology)|class]] are superclass, subclass and infraclass.

Rank is relative, and restricted to a particular systematic schema. For example, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]] have been grouped, in various systems of classification, as a family, order, class, or division (phylum). The use of a narrow set of ranks is challenged by users of [[cladistics]]; for example, the mere 10 ranks traditionally used between animal families (governed by the [[Special:WhatLinksHere/International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN)) and animal phyla (usually the highest relevant rank in taxonomic work) often cannot adequately represent the evolutionary history as more about a lineage's [[phylogeny]] becomes known.

In addition, the class rank is quite often not an evolutionary but a [[phenetic]] or [[paraphyletic]] group and as opposed to those ranks governed by the ICZN (family-level, genus-level and [[species]]-level taxa), can usually not be made monophyletic by exchanging the taxa contained therein. This has given rise to [[phylogenetic taxonomy]] and the ongoing development of the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', which has been proposed as a new alternative to replace Linnean classification and govern the application of names to [[clade]]s.  Many cladists do not see any need to depart from traditional nomenclature as governed by the ICZN, [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], etc.

The term '''boundary paradox''' refers to the conflict between traditional, [[Taxonomic rank|rank-based]] classification of life and evolutionary thinking. In the hierarchy of ranked categories it is implicitly assumed that the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] gap is growing along with increasing ranks: two [[species]] from the same [[genus]] are more similar than other two species from different genera in the same [[Family (biology)|family]], these latter two species are more similar than any two species from different families of the same [[Order (biology)|order]], and so on. However, this requirement may only satisfy for the classification of contemporary organisms; difficulties arise if we wish to classify descendants together with their ancestors. Theoretically, such a classification necessarily involves segmentation of the spatio-temporal continuum of populations into groups with crisp boundaries. However, the problem is not only that many parent populations would separate at species level from their offspring. The truly paradoxical situation is that some between-species boundaries would necessarily coincide with between-genus boundaries, and a few between-genus boundaries with borders between families, and so on.&lt;ref name="taxonpaper"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Podani | first = János | year = 2009 | title = Taxonomy versus evolution | journal = Taxon | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 1049–1053 | doi = 10.1002/tax.584001 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SynHung"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Podani | first = János | year = 2010 | title = Taxonomy in evolutionary perspective.

==Historical background==
[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], in ''[[Philosophie zoologique]]'' (1809), was the first who questioned the objectivity of rank-based classification of life, by saying:
{{Quote | text = …classes, orders, families, genera and nomenclatures are weapons of our own invention. We could not do without them, but we must use them with discretion. …among her productions nature has not really formed either classes, orders, families, genera or constant species, but only individuals who succeed one another and resemble those from which they sprung. | author = J. B. Lamarck &lt;ref name = "PhilZool"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Lamarck | first1 = Jean-Baptiste | title = Zoological Philosophy. Translated by H. Elliot. | location = Chicago | publisher = Univ. Chicago Press | date = 1984 | pages = 20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Half a century later, [[Charles Darwin]] explained that sharp separation of groups of organisms observed at present becomes less obvious if we go back into the past:
{{Quote | text = The most common case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a dozen characters, the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that period made some small approach to each other. | author=C.R. Darwin &lt;ref name = "Origin"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Darwin | first1 = Charles | title = The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | location = London | publisher = John Murray |  date = 1859 | page = 230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In his book on [[orchid]]s, Darwin also warned that the system of ranks would not work if we knew more details about past life:
{{Quote | text = To make a perfect gradation, all the extinct forms which have ever existed, along many lines of descent converging to the common progenitor of the order, would have to be called into life. It is due to their absence, and to the consequent wide gaps in the series, that we are enabled to divide the existing species into definable groups, such as genera, families, and tribes.| author=C.R. Darwin &lt;ref name = "Orchids"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Darwin | first1 = Charles | title = On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing.  | location = London | publisher = John Murray | date = 1862 | pages = 330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Finally, [[Richard Dawkins]] has argued recently that{{Quote | text = If we assume, as almost every anthropologist today accepts, that all members of the genus Homo are descended from ancestors belonging to the genus we call Australopithecus, it necessarily follows that, somewhere along the chain of descent from one species to the other, there must have been at least one individual who sat exactly on the borderline. }}
and
{{Quote | text = Indeed, on the evolutionary view, the conferring of discrete names should actually become impossible if only the fossil record were more complete. In one way, it is fortunate that fossils are so rare. If we had a continuous and unbroken fossil record, the granting of distinct names to species and genera would become impossible, or at least very problematical. }}
with the following conclusion:
{{Quote | text = The [Linnaean] system works, as long as we don’t try to classify the dead antecedents. But as soon as we include our hypothetically complete fossil record, all the neat separations break down. | author= R. Dawkins &lt;ref name = "Show"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Dawkins | first1 = Richard | title = The Greatest Show on Earth. The Evidence for Evolution.  | location = New York | publisher = Free Press | date = 2009 | pages = 192–195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Illustrative models== 
The paradox may be best illustrated by model diagrams similar to Darwin’s single [[evolutionary tree]] in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Origin" /&gt; In these [[tree graph]]s, dots represent populations and edges correspond to parent-offspring relations. The trees are placed into a [[coordinate system]] which is one-dimensional (time) for a single lineage, and two-dimensional (differentiation vs. time) for [[cladogenesis]] or evolution with divergence.
[[File:BParaSingleLineage.jpg|thumb|Boundary paradox: [[chronospecies]] replace each other in time for a single lineage, with hypothetical genera and families superimposed.]] 
In the single lineage model we now consider a sequence of populations along an extremely long time axis, say several hundred million years, with the last dot representing an extant population. In the figure there is space for a few dots even though edges between adjacent populations are hidden. We could use a second axis to express differentiation, but it is not necessary for our purposes. Here we assume that there is no extinction and all branching events are disregarded (if there were no branches at all, then the changes would correspond to a typical [[anagenesis]]. Classification of organisms along this sequence into species is shown by small ellipses. If the differences between certain species are judged to be large enough to justify classification into distinct genera, then generic separators must each coincide with a between-species boundary. If differences reach family-level differentiation, which is easy to imagine over the very long time we consider here, the consequence is that a family-level border must overlap with a between-genus and, in turn, a between-species border (gray arrow in the figure). One cannot imagine, however, that a parent and its offspring are so distinct that they should be classified to different families, or even genera – that would be paradoxical. This illustrates Dawkins’ above argumentation on human ancestry at the level of genera, ''[[Homo]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus]]''.
[[File:BParaDivergence.jpg|thumb|Boundary paradox: evolutionary divergence breaks up Linnaean ranks. Gray curly brackets indicate morphological ranges for each genus.]] 
Darwin placed emphasis on divergence, that is, when a parent population splits and these offspring populations diverge gradually, each following their own anagenetic sequence potentially with further divergence events. In this case, evolutionary (say morphological) divergence is expressed on a new, horizontal, axis and time becomes the vertical axis. At time point 1 an imaginary taxonomist judges populations A and B to belong to different species, but within the same genus. Their respective descendants, C and D are observed at time 2, and considered to represent two separate genera because their morphological difference is large. The paradox is that while A and C, as well as B and D remain within generic limits but C and D do not, so that ancestors cannot be classified together with their descendants meaningfully in a Linnaean system. This figure illustrates the problem Darwin has discussed in the [[fish]] and [[reptile]] example.
[[File:GapsInFossilRecord.jpg |thumb| Gaps in fossil record allow separation of known species into separate [[taxa]]. Full knowledge of extant organisms would reveal continuity of populations.]]  
Let us consider a hypothetical evolutionary tree with four recent species, A to D, classified into two genera that are fairly distant from each other morphologically. We assume, further, that from the [[fossil record]] we only know their common ancestor, E, representing yet another genus for a taxonomist because it takes “intermediate” position between the other two – yet considerably different from both. All other forms went extinct; therefore we have classification of these five species into three genera, which would be illogical if more fossils were known. This illustrates Darwin’s and Dawkins’ examples on the role of gaps in the fossil record in classification – and nomenclature.

==Resolution==
[[File:CladesSingleLineage.jpg |thumb|Groups that may be delineated in the single lineage model form a fully nested system.]]
[[File:CladesDivergence.jpg |thumb|Groups delineated in the divergence model correspond to sister groups within a larger clade, with populations A and B representing stem species on the lineage leading to each.]]
As demonstrated, given a [[Darwinian evolution]]ary model, descendants and their ancestors cannot be classified together within the system of Linnean ranks. Solution is provided by cladistic classification in which each group is composed of an ancestor and all of its descendant populations, a condition called [[monophyly]]. In the above models [[monophyletic]] groups may be obtained by cutting a branch (subtree) from the tree at places where, for instance, new [[apomorphic]] (evolutionary derived) characters appear. For these groups there is no need to consider how much change occurred between members of one group as compared to those of the other.

[[File:Taxonomic Rank Graph.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.7|The major ranks: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species, applied to the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes''.]]
{{Biological classification}}
In [[biological classification]], '''taxonomic rank''' is the relative level of a group of organisms (a [[taxon]]) in an ancestral or hereditary [[hierarchy]]. A common system consists of [[species]], [[genus]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[class (biology)|class]] ([[clade]]), [[phylum (biology)|phylum]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[domain (biology)|domain]]. The study of taxonomy is also called [[cladistics]].

A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] or features from common ancestors. The rank of any ''species'' and the description of its ''genus'' is ''basic''; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art2 |at=Articles 2 and 3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |year=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a particular species, the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes'': the [[Species|specific name or specific epithet]] ''vulpes'' (small ''v'') identifies a particular species in the genus ''Vulpes'' (capital ''V'') which comprises all the "true" foxes. Their close relatives are all in the family [[Canidae]], which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher major rank, the order [[Carnivora]], includes [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and [[Feliformia|feliforms]] (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class [[Mammalia]], which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum [[Chordata]], and with them among all animals in the kingdom [[Animalia]]. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing [[cell nuclei]] in the domain [[Eukarya]].

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' defines ''rank'' as: "The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a [[taxon]] in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily)."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Fourth Edition |publisher=International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |url=http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main ranks ==
In his landmark publications, such as the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', [[Carl Linnaeus]] used a ranking scale limited to kingdom, class, order, genus, species, and one rank below species. Today, the nomenclature is regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. There are seven main taxonomic ranks: kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus, and species. In addition, ''domain'' (proposed by [[Carl Woese]]) is now widely used as a fundamental rank, although it is not mentioned in any of the nomenclature codes, and is a synonym for dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974.&lt;ref name=Moore1974&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=R.

A taxon is usually assigned a rank when it is given its formal name. The basic ranks are species and genus. When an organism is given a species name it is assigned to a genus, and the genus name is part of the species name.

The species name is also called a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]], that is, a two-term name. For example, the zoological name for the human species is ''Homo sapiens''. This is usually italicized in print or underlined when italics are not available. In this case, ''Homo'' is the generic name and it is capitalized; ''sapiens'' indicates the species and it is not capitalized.

==Ranks in zoology==
There are definitions of the following taxonomic ranks in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]: superfamily, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, subgenus, species, subspecies.

The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature divides names into "family-group names", "genus-group names" and "species-group names". The Code explicitly mentions the following ranks for these categories:

----
:Superfamily

''[[Family (biology)|Family]]''
:[[Subfamily]]
:[[Tribe (biology)|Tribe]]
:[[Subtribe]]

----

''[[Genus]]''
:[[Subgenus]]

----
''[[Species]]''
:[[Subspecies]]

----

The rules in the Code apply to the ranks of superfamily to subspecies, and only to some extent to those above the rank of superfamily. Among "genus-group names" and "species-group names" no further ranks are officially allowed. Zoologists sometimes use additional terms such as ''species group'', ''species subgroup'', ''species complex'' and ''superspecies'' for convenience as extra, but unofficial, ranks between the subgenus and species levels in [[taxa]] with many species, e.g. the genus ''[[Drosophila]]''. (Note the potentially confusing use of "species group" as both a category of ranks as well as an unofficial rank itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}})

At higher ranks (family and above) a lower level may be denoted by adding the prefix "''infra''", meaning ''lower'', to the rank.  For example, ''infra''order (below suborder) or ''infra''family (below subfamily).

===Names of zoological taxa===
* A taxon above the rank of species has a scientific name in one part (a uninominal name).
* A species has a name composed of two parts (a binomial name or [[binomen]]): [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] + [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus''.
* A subspecies has a name composed of three parts (a trinomial name or [[trinomen]]): generic name + specific name + [[subspecific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus italicus''. As there is only one possible rank below that of species, no connecting term to indicate rank is needed or used.

==Ranks in botany==
According to Art 3.1 of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) the most important ranks of taxa are: kingdom, division or phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. According to Art 4.1 the secondary ranks of taxa are tribe, section, series, variety and form. There is an indeterminate number of ranks. The ICN explicitly mentions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Articles 3 and 4 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |year=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
'''''primary ranks'''''
:'''''secondary ranks'''''
::'''''further ranks'''''

----
'''''kingdom''''' (''regnum'')
::''subregnum''

'''''division''''' or '''phylum''' (''divisio'', ''phylum'')
::''subdivisio'' or ''subphylum''

'''''class''''' (''classis'')
::''subclassis''

'''''order''''' (''ordo'')
::''subordo''

----

::''subseries''

'''''species''''' (''species'')
::''subspecies''
:'''variety''' (''varietas'')
::''subvarietas''
:'''form''' (''forma'')
::''subforma''

----

There are definitions of the following taxonomic categories in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]: [[cultivar group]], [[cultivar]], [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]].

The rules in the ICN apply primarily to the ranks of family and below, and only to some extent to those above the rank of family. Also see [[descriptive botanical name]].

===Names of botanical taxa===&lt;!-- [[Nothotaxon]] redirects here --&gt;
Taxa at the rank of genus and above have a [[botanical name]] in one part (unitary name); those at the rank of species and above (but below genus) have a botanical name in two parts ([[binary name]]); all taxa below the rank of species have a botanical name in three parts (an [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]]). To indicate the rank of the infraspecific name, a "connecting term" is needed. Thus ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'', where "subsp." is an abbreviation for "subspecies", is the name of a subspecies of ''[[Poa secunda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art4 |at=Articles 4.2 and 24.1 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |year=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids can be specified either by a "hybrid formula" that specifies the parentage, or may be given a name. For hybrids receiving a [[hybrid name (botany)|hybrid name]], the same ranks apply, prefixed with ''notho'' (Greek: 'bastard'), with nothogenus as the highest permitted rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Article 3.2, and Appendix 1, Articles H.1–3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |year=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Cohort (taxonomy)}}

==== Outdated names for botanical ranks ====
If a different term for the rank was used in an old publication, but the intention is clear, botanical nomenclature specifies certain substitutions:{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* If names were "intended as names of orders, but published with their rank denoted by a term such as": "cohors" [Latin for "cohort";&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W.T. 1992. ''Botanical Latin: History, grammar, syntax, terminology and vocabulary, Fourth edition''. David and Charles.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cohort (taxonomy) redirects here, so...--&gt;see also [[cohort study]] for the use of the term in ecology], "nixus", "alliance", or "Reihe" instead of "order" (Article 17.2), they are treated as names of orders.
* "Family" is substituted for "order" (ordo) or "natural order" (ordo naturalis) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "order" was not intended. (Article 18.2)
* "Subfamily is substituted for "suborder" (subordo) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "suborder" was not intended. (Article 19.2)
* In a publication prior to 1 January 1890, if only one infraspecific rank is used, it is considered to be that of variety. (Article 37.4) This commonly applies to publications that labelled infraspecific taxa with Greek letters, α, β, γ, ...

==Examples==
Classifications of five species follow: the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] familiar in genetics laboratories (''Drosophila melanogaster''), [[human]]s (''Homo sapiens''), the [[pea]]s used by [[Gregor Mendel]] in his discovery of [[genetics]] (''Pisum sativum''), the "fly agaric" mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', and the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. The eight major ranks are given in bold; a selection of minor ranks are given as well.

;Table notes
*In order to keep the table compact and avoid disputed technicalities, some common and uncommon intermediate ranks are omitted. For example, the [[mammals]] of Europe, Africa, and upper North America{{efn|The [[Virginia opossum]] is an exception.}} are in class [[Mammalia]], legion [[Cladotheria]], sublegion [[Zatheria]], infralegion [[Tribosphenida]], subclass [[Theria]], clade [[Eutheria]], clade [[Placentalia]] – but only Mammalia and Theria are in the table. Legitimate arguments might arise if the commonly used clades Eutheria and Placentalia were both included, over which is the rank "infraclass" and what the other's rank should be, or whether the two names are synonyms.
*The ranks of higher taxa, especially intermediate ranks, are prone to revision as new information about relationships is discovered. For example, the [[flowering plant]]s have been downgraded from a division (Magnoliophyta) to a subclass (Magnoliidae), and the superorder has become the rank that distinguishes the major groups of flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Chase, M.W. |author2=Reveal, J.L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional classification of primates (class Mammalia, subclass Theria, infraclass Eutheria, order Primates) has been modified by new classifications such as McKenna and Bell (class Mammalia, subclass Theriformes, infraclass Holotheria) with Theria and Eutheria assigned lower ranks between infraclass and the order Primates. See [[mammal classification]] for a discussion. These differences arise because there are few available ranks and many branching points in the fossil record.
*Within species further units may be recognised. Animals may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Homo sapiens sapiens'', modern humans) or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]]s (for example ''Corvus corax varius'' morpha ''leucophaeus'', the pied raven). Plants may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' subsp. ''sativum'', the garden pea) or varieties (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'', snow pea), with cultivated plants getting a [[cultivar]] name (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'' 'Snowbird'). Bacteria may be classified by [[strain (biology)|strains]] (for example [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]], a strain that can cause [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]).

==Terminations of names==
[[Taxa]] above the genus level are often given names based on the [[type genus]], with a standard termination. The terminations used in forming these names depend on the kingdom (and sometimes the phylum and class) as set out in the table below.

Pronunciations given are the [[Traditional English pronunciation of Latin|most Anglicized]]. More Latinate pronunciations are also common, particularly {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} rather than {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} for stressed ''a''.

;Table notes:
* In botany and mycology names at the rank of family and below are based on the name of a genus, sometimes called the [[type genus]] of that taxon, with a standard ending. For example, the rose family, [[Rosaceae]], is named after the genus ''Rosa'', with the standard ending "-aceae" for a family. Names above the rank of family are also formed from a generic name, or are descriptive (like [[Gymnosperm]]ae or [[Fungus|Fungi]]).
* For animals, there are standard suffixes for taxa only up to the rank of superfamily.&lt;ref&gt;ICZN article 29.2&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform suffix has been suggested (but not recommended) in [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]&lt;ref&gt;Pearse, A.S. (1936) ''[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6258024 Zoological names. A list of phyla, classes, and orders, prepared for section F, American Association for the Advancement of Science.]'' American Association for the Advancement of Science, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; as ''-ida'' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|d|ə}} for orders, for example; protozoologists seem to adopt this system. Many metazoan (higher animals) orders also have such suffix, e.g. [[Hyolithida]] and [[Naraoiida|Nectaspida (Naraoiida)]].
* Forming a name based on a generic name may be not straightforward. For example, the {{lang|la|homo}} has the genitive {{lang|la|hominis}}, thus the genus ''Homo'' (human) is in the [[Great ape|Hominidae]], not "Homidae".
* The ranks of epifamily, infrafamily and infratribe (in animals) are used where the complexities of phyletic branching require finer-than-usual distinctions. Although they fall below the rank of superfamily, they are not regulated under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and hence do not have formal standard endings. The suffixes listed here are regular, but informal.&lt;ref&gt;As supplied by Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In virology, the formal endings for taxa of [[viroid]]s and of [[satellite (biology)|satellite nucleic acids]] are similar to viruses, only -vir- is replaced by -viroid-, -satellit-.&lt;ref name=ICTV_2018/&gt;

==All ranks== 
There is an indeterminate number of ranks, as a taxonomist may invent a new rank at will, at any time, if they feel this is necessary. In doing so, there are some restrictions, which will vary with the [[Nomenclature codes|nomenclature code]] which applies.

The following is an artificial synthesis, solely for purposes of demonstration of relative rank (but see notes), from most general to most specific:&lt;ref&gt;For the general usage and coordination of zoological ranks between the phylum and family levels, including many intercalary ranks, see Carroll (1988). For additional intercalary ranks in zoology, see especially Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988); McKenna &amp; Bell (1997); Milner (1988); Novacek (1986, cit. in Carroll 1988: 499, 629); and [[Paul Sereno]]'s 1986 classification of [[ornithischia]]n dinosaurs as reported in Lambert (1990: 149, 159). For botanical ranks, including many intercalary ranks, see Willis &amp; McElwain (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear from the sources how these two sequences are to be coordinated (or interwoven) within a unitary zoological hierarchy of ranks.

== Significance and problems ==
Ranks are assigned based on subjective dissimilarity, and do not fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists.&lt;ref name="Gingerich1987"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gingerich | first1 = P. D. | doi = 10.1139/z87-169 | title = Evolution and the fossil record: patterns, rates, and processes | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1060 | year = 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some groups have many described species not because they are more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other groups.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Of these many ranks, the most basic is species. However, this is not to say that a taxon at any other rank may not be sharply defined, or that any species is guaranteed to be sharply defined. It varies from case to case. Ideally, a taxon is intended to represent a [[clade]], that is, the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of the organisms under discussion, but this is not a requirement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A classification in which all taxa have formal ranks cannot adequately reflect knowledge about phylogeny. Since taxon names are dependent on ranks in traditional Linnaean systems of classification, taxa without ranks cannot be given names. Alternative approaches, such as using [[circumscriptional name]]s, avoid this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kluge|first1= N.J.|date= 1999|title= A system of alternative nomenclatures of supra-species taxa. Linnaean and post-Linnaean principles of systematics|journal= Entomological Review|volume= 79|issue=2|pages= 133–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kluge |first1=N.J. |title=Circumscriptional names of higher taxa in Hexapoda |journal=Bionomina |date=2010 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15–55 |doi=10.11646/bionomina.1.1.3|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical difficulty with superimposing taxonomic ranks over evolutionary trees is manifested as the [[Taxonomic boundary paradox|boundary paradox]] which may be illustrated by Darwinian evolutionary models.

There are no rules for how many species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a category above the species level).&lt;ref&gt;Stuessy, T.F. (2009). ''Plant Taxonomy: The Systematic Evaluation of Comparative Data.'' 2nd ed. Columbia University Press, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brusca"&gt;Brusca, R.C. &amp; Brusca, G.J. (2003). ''Invertebrates''. 2nd ed. Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-[[polyphyletic]]), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks).&lt;ref name="Brusca" /&gt; For animals, at least the [[phylum]] rank is usually associated with a certain [[body plan]], which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Mnemonic==
There are several acronyms intended to help memorise the taxonomic hierarchy, such as "King Phillip came over for great spaghetti". See [[taxonomy mnemonic]]. In Season 3, episode 16 ("Virtual Systems Analysis" ) of the NBC comedy [[Community]] the character Hawthorne Pierce (Chevy Chase) refers to the mnemonic variant "Kevin, Please Come Over for Gay Sex."

{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]], '''taxonomy''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wikt:τάξις|τάξις]]'' ([[taxis]])|arrangement||''[[wikt:νόμος|-νομία]]'' ([[:wikt:-nomy|-nomia]])|[[Scientific method|method]]}}) is the [[science|scientific]] study of naming, defining ([[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribing]]) and classifying groups of biological [[organism]]s based on shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped into [[taxon|taxa]] (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a [[taxonomic rank]]; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a more inclusive group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]] (''division'' is sometimes used in botany in place of ''phylum''), [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]]. The Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] is regarded as the founder of the current system of taxonomy, as he developed a ranked system known as [[Linnaean taxonomy]] for categorizing organisms and [[binomial nomenclature]] for naming organisms.

With advances in the theory, data and analytical technology of biological systematics, the Linnaean system has transformed into a system of modern biological classification intended to reflect the [[evolution]]ary relationships among organisms, both living and extinct.

== Definition ==
The exact definition of taxonomy varies from source to source, but the core of the discipline remains: the conception, naming, and classification of groups of organisms.&lt;ref name="Wilkins2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |title=What is systematics and what is taxonomy? |last=Wilkins |first=J.S. |date=5 February 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827124330/http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |archive-date=27 August 2016 |access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As points of reference, recent definitions of taxonomy are presented below:

# "Systematics studies [[phylogeny]] to provide a pattern that can be translated into the classification and names of the more inclusive field of taxonomy" (listed as a desirable but unusual definition)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Taxonomy for the twenty-first century |last=Wheeler |first=Quentin D. |date=2004 |work=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |editor-last=H.C.J.

Wheeler |issue=1444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The varied definitions either place taxonomy as a sub-area of systematics (definition 2), invert that relationship (definition 6), or appear to consider the two terms synonymous. There is some disagreement as to whether [[biological nomenclature]] is considered a part of taxonomy (definitions 1 and 2), or a part of systematics outside taxonomy.&lt;ref name="Herbarium"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nomenclature, Names, and Taxonomy|url=http://herbarium.usu.edu:80/teaching/4420/botnom.htm|year=2005|website=Intermountain Herbarium – USU|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123030604/http://herbarium.usu.edu/teaching/4420/botnom.htm|archive-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, definition 6 is paired with the following definition of systematics that places nomenclature outside taxonomy:&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;
* ''Systematics'': "The study of the identification, taxonomy, and nomenclature of organisms, including the classification of living things with regard to their natural relationships and the study of variation and the evolution of taxa".

In 1970 Michener ''et al.'' defined "systematic biology" and "taxonomy" (terms that are often confused and used interchangeably) in relationship to one another as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Michener, Charles D., John O. Corliss, Richard S. Cowan, Peter H. Raven, Curtis W. Sabrosky, Donald S. Squires, and G. W. Wharton (1970). ''Systematics In Support of Biological Research''. Division of Biology and Agriculture, National Research Council. Washington, D.C. 25 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is the field that (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations. This is a field with a long history that in recent years has experienced a notable renaissance, principally with respect to theoretical content. Part of the theoretical material has to do with evolutionary areas (topics e and f above), the rest relates especially to the problem of classification. Taxonomy is that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A whole set of terms including taxonomy, systematic biology, systematics, biosystematics, scientific classification, biological classification, and [[phylogenetics]] have at times had overlapping meanings – sometimes the same, sometimes slightly different, but always related and intersecting.&lt;ref name=Wilkins2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Small1989"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Small |first=Ernest |year=1989 |title=Systematics of Biological Systematics (Or, Taxonomy of Taxonomy) |journal=Taxon |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=335–356 |doi=10.2307/1222265 |jstor=1222265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadest meaning of "taxonomy" is used here. The term itself was introduced in 1813 by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|de Candolle]], in his ''Théorie élémentaire de la botanique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Plant systematics: An integrated approach |last=Singh |first=Gurcharan |date=2004 |publisher=Science Publishers |isbn=978-1-57808-351-0 |page=20 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lindley]] provided an early definition of systematics in 1830, although he wrote of "systematic botany" rather than using the term "systematics".&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, J. S. ''[http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ What is systematics and what is taxonomy?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827124330/http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |date=27 August 2016 }}''. Available on http://evolvingthoughts.net&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans tend to use the terms "systematics" and "biosystematics" for the study of biodiversity as a whole, whereas North Americans tend to use "taxonomy" more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Brusca, R. C., &amp; Brusca, G. J. (2003). Invertebrates (2nd ed.). Sunderland, Mass. : Sinauer Associates, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; However, taxonomy, and in particular [[alpha taxonomy]], is more specifically the identification, description, and naming (i.e. nomenclature) of organisms,&lt;ref name="Fortey"&gt;{{Citation |last= Fortey |first= Richard |author-link= Richard Fortey

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
while "classification" focuses on placing organisms within hierarchical groups that show their relationships to other organisms.

=== Monograph and taxonomic revision ===
A '''taxonomic revision''' or '''taxonomic review''' is a novel analysis of the variation patterns in a particular [[taxon]]. This analysis may be executed on the basis of any combination of the various available kinds of characters, such as morphological, anatomical, palynological, biochemical and genetic. A [[Monograph#In biology|monograph]] or complete revision is a revision that is comprehensive for a taxon for the information given at a particular time, and for the entire world. Other (partial) revisions may be restricted in the sense that they may only use some of the available character sets or have a limited spatial scope. A revision results in a conformation of or new insights in the relationships between the subtaxa within the taxon under study, which may lead to a change in the classification of these subtaxa, the identification of new subtaxa, or the merger of previous subtaxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Maxted |first=Nigel |year=1992 |title=Towards Defining a Taxonomic Revision Methodology |journal=Taxon |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=653–660 |doi=10.2307/1222391 |jstor=1222391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomic characters ===
Taxonomic characters are the taxonomic attributes that can be used to provide the evidence from which relationships (the [[phylogeny]]) between taxa  are inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1991). Principles of Systematic Zoology. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinds of taxonomic characters include:&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1991), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''alpha taxonomy'''" is primarily used today to refer to the discipline of finding, describing, and naming [[taxon|taxa]], particularly species.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; In earlier literature, the term had a different meaning, referring to morphological taxonomy, and the products of research through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rosselló-Mora |first1=Ramon |last2=Amann |first2=Rudolf |date=1 January 2001 |title=The species concept for prokaryotes |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=39–67 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2001.tb00571.x |issn=1574-6976 |pmid=11152940|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Bertram Turrill]] introduced the term "alpha taxonomy" in a series of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy.{{sfn|Turrill|1938}}&lt;blockquote&gt; ... there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetics colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable ... Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated "alpha", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which "place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an "omega" taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a "beta" taxonomy.{{sfn|Turrill|1938}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turrill thus explicitly excludes from alpha taxonomy various areas of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy.{{sfn|Turrill|1938|pp=365–366}}

Later authors have used the term in a different sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Steyskal |first=G.C. |year=1965 |title=Trend curves of the rate of species description in zoology |journal=Science |volume=149 |issue=3686 |pages=880–882 |bibcode=1965Sci...149..880S |doi=10.1126/science.149.3686.880 |pmid=17737388|s2cid=36277653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; Thus, [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1968 defined "'''beta taxonomy'''" as the classification of ranks higher than species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |title=The Role of Systematics in Biology: The study of all aspects of the diversity of life is one of the most important concerns in biology |date=9 February 1968 |journal=Science |volume=159 |issue=3815 |pages=595–599 |bibcode=1968Sci...159..595M |doi=10.1126/science.159.3815.595 |pmid=4886900 |author-link=Ernst Mayr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species is even more important for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as "beta taxonomy".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Microtaxonomy and macrotaxonomy ===
{{Main|Species problem}}
How species should be defined in a particular group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that are referred to as the [[species problem]]. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |date=1982 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-36446-2 |chapter=Chapter 6: Microtaxonomy, the science of species |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHThtE2R0UQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1508 |title=Result of Your Query |website=biological-concepts.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170414/http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1508 |archive-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/taxonomy/taxonomy-meaning-levels-periods-and-role/32373 |title=Taxonomy: Meaning, Levels, Periods and Role |date=27 May 2016 |work=Biology Discussion |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073645/http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/taxonomy/taxonomy-meaning-levels-periods-and-role/32373 |archive-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at the higher [[taxonomic rank]]s subgenus and above.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt;

== History ==
While some descriptions of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms did not occur until the 18th century. Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. There are a number of stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called "artificial systems", including [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s system of sexual classification for plants (Linnaeus's 1735 classification of animals was entitled "[[Systema Naturae]]" ("the System of Nature"), implying that he, at least, believed that it was more than an "artificial system"). Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as "natural systems", such as those of [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), de Candolle (1813) and [[Bentham and Hooker]] (1862–1863). These classifications described empirical patterns and were pre-[[evolution]]ary in thinking. The publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) led to a new explanation for classifications, based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of [[phyletic]] systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of [[August Eichler|Eichler]] (1883) and [[Adolf Engler|Engler]] (1886–1892). The advent of [[cladistic]] methodology in the 1970s led to classifications based on the sole criterion of [[monophyly]], supported by the presence of [[synapomorphies]]. Since then, the evidentiary basis has been expanded with data from [[molecular genetics]] that for the most part complements traditional [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]].{{sfn|Datta|1988}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}{{sfn|Stace|1989}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}{{sfn|Stuessy|2009}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}

=== Pre-Linnaean ===

==== Early taxonomists ====
Naming and classifying human surroundings likely begun with the onset of language. Distinguishing poisonous plants from edible plants is integral to the survival of human communities. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.&lt;ref name="Manktelow"&gt;Manktelow, M.

Organisms were first classified by [[Aristotle]] ([[Greece]], 384–322 BC) during his stay on the [[Lesbos|Island of Lesbos]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, E. (1982) ''The Growth of Biological Thought''. Belknap P. of Harvard U.P., Cambridge (Mass.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palaeos"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://palaeos.com/taxonomy/history.html |title=Palaeos : Taxonomy |website=palaeos.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331022648/http://palaeos.com/taxonomy/history.html |archive-date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica – Taxonomy" /&gt; He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms ''attributes'', such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied.&lt;ref name="Roanoke"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/genomics_course/roanoke/bio101ch20.htm |title=Biology 101, Ch 20 |date=23 March 1998 |website=cbs.dtu.dk |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628023508/http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/genomics_course/roanoke/bio101ch20.htm |archive-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; Some of his groups of animals, such as ''Anhaima'' (animals without blood, translated as [[invertebrate]]s) and ''Enhaima'' (animals with blood, roughly the [[vertebrate]]s), as well as groups like the [[shark]]s and [[cetacean]]s, are still commonly used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |title-link=Aristotle's Lagoon |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |date=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=384–395 |author-link=Armand Marie Leroi}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student [[Theophrastus]] (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]''. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized can be traced back to Theophrastus, such as ''[[Cornus (genus)|Cornus]]'', ''[[Crocus]]'', and ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]''.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;

==== Medieval ====
Taxonomy in the [[Middle Ages]] was largely based on the [[Aristotelian system]],&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; with additions concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the [[great chain of being]] in the Western [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition,&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. The Aristotelian system did not classify plants or [[fungi]], due to the lack of microscopes at the time,&lt;ref name="Britannica – Taxonomy" /&gt; as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the ''scala naturae'' (the Natural Ladder).&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; This, as well, was taken into consideration in the great chain of being.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; Advances were made by scholars such as [[Procopius]], [[Timotheos of Gaza]], [[Demetrios Pepagomenos]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;

==== Renaissance and early modern ====

During the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], categorizing organisms became more prevalent,&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;
and taxonomic works became ambitious enough to replace the ancient texts. This is sometimes credited to the development of sophisticated optical lenses, which allowed the morphology of organisms to be studied in much greater detail. One of the earliest authors to take advantage of this leap in technology was the Italian physician [[Andrea Cesalpino]] (1519–1603), who has been called "the first taxonomist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino |title=Andrea Cesalpino {{!}} Italian physician, philosopher, and botanist |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075220/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino |archive-date=5 April 2017 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''De Plantis'' came out in 1583, and described more than 1500 plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/deplantislibrixv00cesa |title=De plantis libri XVI |last1=Cesalpino |first1=Andrea |last2=Marescotti |first2=Giorgio |date=1583 |publisher=Apud Georgium Marescottum |location=Florence |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino#ref130098 |title=Andrea Cesalpino {{!}} Italian physician, philosopher, and botanist |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075220/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino#ref130098 |archive-date=5 April 2017 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two large plant families that he first recognized are still in use today: the [[Asteraceae]] and [[Brassicaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=International Edition Vegetables I: Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae (Handbook of Plant Breeding) |last=Jaime |first=Prohens |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4419-2474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the 17th century [[John Ray]] ([[England]], 1627–1705) wrote many important taxonomic works.&lt;ref name="Britannica – Taxonomy"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy |title=taxonomy {{!}} biology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075451/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy |archive-date=5 April 2017 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably his greatest accomplishment was ''Methodus Plantarum Nova'' (1682),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=John |first=Ray |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/84226#page/7/mode/1up |title=Methodus plantarum nova |publisher=impensis Henrici Faithorne &amp; Joannis Kersey, ad insigne Rofæ Coemeterio D.

At the time, his classifications were perhaps the most complex yet produced by any taxonomist, as he based his taxa on many combined characters. The next major taxonomic works were produced by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] (France, 1656–1708).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Pitton-de-Tournefort |title=Joseph Pitton de Tournefort {{!}} French botanist and physician |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075951/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Pitton-de-Tournefort |archive-date=5 April 2017 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work from 1700, ''Institutiones Rei Herbariae'', included more than 9000 species in 698 genera, which directly influenced Linnaeus, as it was the text he used as a young student.&lt;ref name=Manktelow /&gt;

=== Linnaean era ===
{{Main|Linnaean taxonomy}}
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', Leiden, 1735]]
The Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778)&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; ushered in a new era of taxonomy. With his major works ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' 1st Edition in 1735,&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1735) ''Systema naturae, sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species''. Haak, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753,&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1753) ''Species Plantarum''. Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|''Systema Naturae'' 10th Edition]],&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1758) ''Systema naturae, sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species'', 10th Edition. Haak, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species,&lt;ref name="Britannica – Linnaean"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/The-Linnaean-system |title=taxonomy – The Linnaean system {{!}} biology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405074215/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/The-Linnaean-system |archive-date=5 April 2017 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, and&amp;nbsp;species, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower.&lt;ref name="Britannica – Linnaean" /&gt; Thus the [[Linnaean system]] was born, and is still used in essentially the same way today as it was in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Britannica – Linnaean" /&gt; Currently, plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus' work as the "starting point" for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Donk |first=M.A. |date=December 1957 |title=Typification and later starting-points |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop018-019.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Taxon |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=245–256 |doi=10.2307/1217493 |jstor=1217493 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091529/http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop018-019.pdf |archive-date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Names published before these dates are referred to as "pre-Linnaean", and not considered valid (with the exception of spiders published in ''[[Svenska Spindlar]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Carl |first1=Clerck |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209583#page/7/mode/1up |title=Svenska spindlar |last2=Carl |first2=Bergquist |last3=Eric |first3=Borg |last4=L. |first4=Gottman |last5=Lars |first5=Salvius |publisher=Literis Laur.

Even taxonomic names published by Linnaeus himself before these dates are considered pre-Linnaean.&lt;ref name=Manktelow /&gt;

A pattern of groups nested within groups was specified by Linnaeus' classifications of plants and animals, and these patterns began to be represented as [[dendrograms]] of the animal and plant [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] toward the end of the 18th century, well before Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'' was published.&lt;ref name="Britannica – Taxonomy" /&gt; The pattern of the "Natural System" did not entail a generating process, such as evolution, but may have implied it, inspiring early transmutationist thinkers. Among early works exploring the idea of a [[transmutation of species]] were [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s (Charles Darwin's grandfather's) 1796 ''[[Zoonomia|Zoönomia]]'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' of 1809.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; The idea was popularized in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', published anonymously by [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14098.ctl |title=Victorian Sensation: The Extraordinary Publication, Reception, and Secret Authorship of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation |last=Secord |first=James A. |date=2000 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=978-0-226-74410-0 |author-link=James A.

With Darwin's theory, a general acceptance quickly appeared that a classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of [[common descent]].&lt;ref name="Britannica – since Linnaeus"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Classification-since-Linnaeus |title=taxonomy – Classification since Linnaeus {{!}} biology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075916/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Classification-since-Linnaeus |archive-date=5 April 2017 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tree of life (science)|Tree of life]] representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated.

=== Kingdoms and domains ===
[[File:Biological classification L Pengo vflip.svg|thumb|upright|The basic scheme of modern classification. Many other levels can be used; domain, the highest level within life, is both new and disputed.]]
{{Main|Kingdom (biology)}}

Well before discovery of Carl Linnaeus (Botanist) plants and animals were considered separate Kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/biology/kingdom-classification-of-living-organism/5542 |title=Kingdom Classification of Living Organism |date=2 December 2014 |work=Biology Discussion |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073641/http://www.biologydiscussion.com/biology/kingdom-classification-of-living-organism/5542 |archive-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} Linnaeus used this as the top rank, dividing the physical world into the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdoms. As advances in microscopy made the classification of microorganisms possible, the number of kingdoms increased, five- and six-kingdom systems being the most common.

[[Domain (biology)|Domains]] are a relatively new grouping. First proposed in 1977, [[Carl Woese]]'s [[three-domain system]] was not generally accepted until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.igb.illinois.edu/about/archaea |title=Carl Woese {{!}} Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology |website=www.igb.Illinois.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428163950/http://www.igb.illinois.edu/about/archaea |archive-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called [[Monera]]),&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification" /&gt; with the [[Eukaryota]] for all organisms whose cells contain a [[Nucleus (biology)|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Cracraft|Cracraft, Joel]] and Donaghue, Michael J.

Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517234-5}}. pp. 45, 78, 555&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification" /&gt;

[[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], who published extensively on the classification of [[protist]]s, in 2002&lt;ref name="pmid11931142"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith T |title=The phagotrophic origin of eukaryotes and phylogenetic classification of Protozoa |journal=Int.

His 2004 classification treated the [[archaeobacteria]] as part of a subkingdom of the kingdom Bacteria, i.e., he rejected the three-domain system entirely.&lt;ref name="CavalierSmith2004" /&gt; Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five "dominion" system, adding [[Prion]]obiota ([[Non-cellular life|acellular]] and without [[nucleic acid]]) and [[Virus]]obiota (acellular but ''with'' nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains.&lt;ref name="Luketa2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Luketa |first=S. |year=2012 |title=New views on the megaclassification of life |url=http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num7_4/luketa_protistology_7-4.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Protistology |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=218–237 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150257/http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num7_4/luketa_protistology_7-4.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Biological taxonomy is a sub-discipline of [[biology]], and is generally practiced by biologists known as "taxonomists", though enthusiastic [[Natural history|naturalists]] are also frequently involved in the publication of new taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-big-ugly-problem-heart-of-taxonomy-180964629/ |title=A Few Bad Scientists Are Threatening to Topple Taxonomy |website=Smithsonian |language=en |access-date=24 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because taxonomy aims to describe and organize [[life]], the work conducted by taxonomists is essential for the study of [[biodiversity]] and the resulting field of [[conservation biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/taxonomy-systematics/what-is-taxonomy/index.html |title=What is taxonomy? |publisher=Natural History Museum |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001152618/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/taxonomy-systematics/what-is-taxonomy/index.html |archive-date=1 October 2013 |access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McNeely |first=Jeffrey A. |year=2002 |title=The role of taxonomy in conserving biodiversity |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b06/e3d09692ef9f2b464fbfb7807ff32a35ce47.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=J.

=== Classifying organisms ===
{{Main|Taxonomic rank}}

Biological classification is a critical component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): [[Domain (biology)|Domain]], [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]], [[Phylum]], [[Class (biology)|Class]], [[Order (biology)|Order]], [[Family (biology)|Family]], [[Genus]], [[Species]], and [[Strain (biology)|Strain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.mnemonic-device.com/biology/taxonomy/domain-kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species/ |title=Mnemonic taxonomy / biology: Kingdom Phylum Class Order... |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606171902/https://www.mnemonic-device.com/biology/taxonomy/domain-kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species/ |archive-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{NoteTag|This ranking system, except for "Strain," can be remembered by the mnemonic "Do Kings Play Chess On Fine Glass Sets?"}}

=== Taxonomic descriptions ===
{{See also|Species description}}
[[File:Nepenthes smilesii type specimen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Type (biology)|Type]] specimen for ''[[Nepenthes smilesii]]'', a tropical [[pitcher plant]]]]

The "definition" of a taxon is encapsulated by its description or its diagnosis or by both combined. There are no set rules governing the definition of taxa, but the naming and publication of new taxa is governed by sets of rules.&lt;ref name="Herbarium" /&gt; In [[zoology]], the [[nomenclature]] for the more commonly used ranks ([[Superfamily (taxonomy)|superfamily]] to [[subspecies]]), is regulated by the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN Code'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/loadcachedpage?url=animalbase-code.html |title=ICZN Code |website=animalbase.uni-goettingen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[phycology]], [[mycology]], and [[botany]], the naming of taxa is governed by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICN'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php|website=[[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111104255/http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php|archive-date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial description of a taxon involves five main requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=How can I describe new species?|url=http://iczn.org/content/how-can-i-describe-new-species|publisher=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306133052/http://iczn.org/content/how-can-i-describe-new-species|archive-date=6 March 2012|access-date=21 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The taxon must be given a name based on the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet (a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] for new species, or uninomial for other ranks).
# The name must be unique (i.e. not a [[homonym (biology)|homonym]]).
# The description must be based on at least one name-bearing [[Type species|type specimen]].
# It should include statements about appropriate attributes either to describe (define) the taxon or to differentiate it from other taxa (the diagnosis, ''ICZN Code'', Article 13.1.1, ''ICN'', Article 38, which may or may not be based on morphology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lawley |first1=Jonathan W. |last2=Gamero-Mora |first2=Edgar |last3=Maronna |first3=Maximiliano M. |last4=Chiaverano |first4=Luciano M. |last5=Stampar |first5=Sérgio N. |last6=Hopcroft |first6=Russell R. |last7=Collins |first7=Allen G. |last8=Morandini |first8=André C. |date=2022-09-29 |title=Morphology is not always useful for diagnosis, and that's ok: Species hypotheses should not be bound to a class of data.

Both codes deliberately separate defining the content of a taxon (its [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]) from defining its name.
# These first four requirements must be published in a work that is obtainable in numerous identical copies, as a permanent scientific record.

However, often much more information is included, like the geographic range of the taxon, ecological notes, chemistry, behavior, etc. How researchers arrive at their taxa varies: depending on the available data, and resources, methods vary from simple [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] comparisons of striking features, to elaborate computer analyses of large amounts of [[DNA sequence]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Taxonomy – Evaluating taxonomic characters|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Evaluating-taxonomic-characters|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422143927/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Evaluating-taxonomic-characters|archive-date=22 April 2019|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Author citation ===
{{Main|Author citation (botany)|Author citation (zoology)}}
An "authority" may be placed after a scientific name.&lt;ref name="AJE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aje.com/en/arc/editing-tip-scientific-names-species/ |title=Editing Tip: Scientific Names of Species {{!}} AJE {{!}} American Journal Experts |website=www.aje.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409021714/http://www.aje.com/en/arc/editing-tip-scientific-names-species/ |archive-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority is the name of the scientist or scientists who first validly published the name.&lt;ref name="AJE" /&gt; For example, in 1758 Linnaeus gave the [[Asian elephant]] the scientific name ''Elephas maximus'', so the name is sometimes written as "''Elephas maximus'' Linnaeus, 1758".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/carolus-linnaeus-classification-taxonomy-contributions-to-biology.html |title=Carolus Linnaeus: Classification, Taxonomy &amp; Contributions to Biology – Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com |website=Study.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409021600/http://study.com/academy/lesson/carolus-linnaeus-classification-taxonomy-contributions-to-biology.html |archive-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of authors are frequently abbreviated: the abbreviation ''L.'', for ''Linnaeus,'' is commonly used.

== Phenetics ==
[[File:Phylogenetics.svg|thumb|300px|A comparison of phylogenetic and phenetic (character-based) concepts]]
{{Main|Phenetics}}
In phenetics, also known as taximetrics, or numerical taxonomy, organisms are classified based on overall similarity, regardless of their phylogeny or evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; It results in a measure of hypergeometric "distance" between taxa. Phenetic methods have become relatively rare in modern times, largely superseded by [[Cladistics|cladistic]] analyses, as phenetic methods do not distinguish shared ancestral (or [[plesiomorph]]ic) traits from shared derived (or [[apomorphic]]) traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Classification|url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/classification/classification16.htm|publisher=[[North Carolina State University]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414163250/https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/classification/classification16.htm|archive-date=14 April 2017|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain phenetic methods, such as [[neighbor joining]], have persisted, as rapid estimators of relationship when more advanced methods (such as [[Bayesian inference]]) are too computationally expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Molecular Marker Glossary|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/molmark/mcdgloss.html|last=McDonald|first=David|date=Fall 2008|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610123503/http://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/molmark/McDGloss.html|archive-date=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Taxonomy of ''Drosera''}}
The genus ''[[Drosera]]'' was divided in 1994 by Seine &amp; Barthlott into three [[subgenus|subgenera]] and 11 [[section (botany)|sections]] on the basis of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.

Discovery and description of new species has been occurring since the 10th century, and as recently as the 1940s barely more than 80 species were known. In recent years, Australian [[Allen Lowrie]] has done extensive work in the genus, particularly in describing numerous new species from [[Australia]]. His classification of the genus was replaced by Jan Schlauer's work in 1996, although the correct classification is still disputed.

'''(Benzothiazol-2-ylthio)methyl thiocyanate'''  ('''TCMTB''') is a [[chemical compound]] classified as a [[benzothiazole]].

== Properties ==
TCMTB is an oily, flammable, red to brown liquid with a pungent odor that is very slightly soluble in water. It decomposes on heating producing [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[sulfur oxides]], and [[nitrogen oxide]]s.&lt;ref name = "GESTIS" /&gt; The degradation products are [[2-mercaptobenzothiazole]] (2-MBT) and [[2-benzothiazolesulfonic acid]].&lt;ref name = "EPA" /&gt;

== Uses ==
TCMTB is used as [[microbicidal|wideband microbicide]], [[fungicide|paint fungicide]], and [[algicide|paint gallicide]].&lt;ref name = "GESTIS" /&gt; The active substance approved in 1980 in the United States.&lt;ref name = "EPA"&gt;EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/reregistration/REDs/tcmtb_red.pdf Reregistration Eligibility Decision for 2- (thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazoles (TCMTB)] (PDF; 2.7&amp;nbsp;MB), August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used, for example, in leather preservation,&lt;ref name = "Engin Bagda"&gt;{{cite book| author = Engin Bagda | title = Biocides in Building Coatings | publisher = expert publisher | isbn = 3-81691861-1 | year = 2000 | url = {{Google books | BookID = KSqv_sFSj20C | Page = 59 |plainurl=yes}} | pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the protection of paper products, in wood preservatives, and against germs in industrial water.&lt;ref name = "EPA" /&gt;

In the US, TCMTB is used as a fungicide for [[seed dressing]] in cereals, [[safflower]], cotton and sugar beet.

It is also used when dealing with fungal problems when extracting hydrocarbons via fracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levant |first=Ezra  |date=2014 |title=Groundswell: The Case for Fracking |publisher= McClelland &amp; Stewart |page=192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approval ==
TCMTB is not an authorized plant protection product in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 of 20 November 2002. EUR-Lex Act 319, pp. 3&amp;ndash;11 (PDF) "On the extension of the deadline laid down in Article 8 (2) of Council Directive 91/414 / EEC and on the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to this Directive and the withdrawal of the Authorizations for plant protection products containing these active substances"&lt;/ref&gt;
In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, no plant protection products containing this active substance are authorized.&lt;ref name = "PSM"&gt;PSM-del, EU- 2- (dithiocyanomethylthio) -benzothiazole | CH = DB | A = DB | D = DB | 8 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

TCMTB contributes to health problems in tannery workers as it is a potential [[carcinogen]], and is a [[hepatotoxin]]. It is also a skin sensitizer, and may cause [[contact dermatitis]] in those exposed to the poisonous compound. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://haz-map.com/Agents/7407 | title=TCMTB - Hazardous Agents &amp;#124; Haz-Map }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is mainly used in developing countries.

The '''Teacher Institute for Evolutionary Science''' ('''TIES''') is a project of the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] and a program of the [[Center for Inquiry]] which provides free workshops and materials to [[Elementary school (United States)|elementary]],  [[middle school]], and,  more recently, [[Secondary school|high school]] science teachers to enable them to effectively teach [[evolution]] based on the [[Next Generation Science Standards]].{{R|"RDF"}}{{R|"TIES"}}{{R|"CFI"}}

==History==

In 2013, [[Bertha Vazquez]], TIES director and middle school science teacher in [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools|Miami]], met [[Richard Dawkins]] at the [[University of Miami]] and discussed evolution education with him and a number of science professors. The discussion surrounded the issue of teachers feeling unprepared to teach evolution. This encounter and the understanding that teachers learn the most from each other inspired her to conduct workshops on evolution for her fellow teachers. After hearing about Vazquez's work Dawkins followed up with a visit to Vazquez's school in 2014 to speak to teachers from the Miami-Dade County school district. Dawkins eventually asked Vazquez if she would be willing to take her workshop project nationwide. With the encouragement of Dawkins and funding from his [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|foundation]], and also with encouragement from [[Robyn Blumner]] of the Center for Inquiry, the Teacher Institute for Evolutionary Science began offering workshops in 2015. {{R|"Nerdy"}}{{R|"SCIAM"}}

==Activity==

The first TIES workshop was in April 2015 in collaboration with the [[Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science|Miami Science Museum]]. A total of ten workshops took place in 2015. Since then, the program has expanded, as of 2020, to over 200 workshops in all 50 states. While Bertha Vazquez presented many of the workshops earlier on, over 80 presenters are now active in the nationwide program. Presenters are usually high school or college biology educators{{R|"SI"}} in the states in which their workshops take place, and workshops take into account the given state's evolution education standards. Workshops vary in length, and in cases of longer workshops or webinars, scientists and other relevant guests are also invited to present. Some of these have included [[Nathan Lents]] and [[Jonathan Tweet]].{{R|"Nerdy"}}{{R|"Everyone"}}

In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], TIES moved its workshops online and produced guided lessons in English and Spanish that students can work through on their own.{{R|"Everyone"}}

Vazquez sees TIES as not only about evolution education but also about empowering teachers to be leaders in their educational communities.{{R|"POI"}}

'''Teleology in biology''' is the use of the language of goal-directedness in accounts of [[evolution]]ary [[adaptation]], which some [[biologist]]s and [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] find problematic. The term [[teleonomy]] has also been proposed. Before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], organisms were seen as existing because God had [[creationism|designed and created]] them; their features such as eyes were taken by [[natural theology]] to have been made to enable them to carry out their [[function (biology)|functions]], such as seeing. [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply [[natural selection]] rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed ([[orthogenesis]]), and in [[Vitalism|vitalist]] versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by [[natural selection]] acting on [[Genetic variation|inherited variation]], the use of [[teleology]] in biology has attracted criticism, and attempts have been made to teach students to avoid teleological language.

Nevertheless, biologists still often write about evolution as if organisms had goals, and some [[philosophy of biology|philosophers of biology]] such as [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] and biologists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] consider that teleological language is unavoidable in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Context==
===Teleology===

[[Teleology]], from  [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:τέλος|τέλος]], ''telos'' "end, purpose"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Eric |author-link=Eric Partridge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xA9dxrhfa5kC |title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English |publisher=Routledge |year=1977 |page=4187|isbn=9780415050777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], ''logia'', "a branch of learning", was coined by the philosopher [[Christian von Wolff]] in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolff |first=Christian von |author-link1=Christian Wolff (philosopher)|date=1732 |title=Philosophia Rationalis Sive Logica: Methodo Scientifica Pertractata Et Ad Usum Scientiarum Atque Vitae Aptata |publisher=Prostat in officina libraria Rengeriana |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YFxIAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept derives from the ancient Greek philosophy of [[Aristotle]], where the [[final cause]] (the purpose) of a thing is its [[function (biology)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presuppositions of Aristotle's Politics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-politics/supplement2.html |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Aristotle's biology]] does not envisage [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |author-link=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |title-link=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=272–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases used by biologists like "a function of&amp;nbsp;... is to&amp;nbsp;..." or "is designed for" are teleological at least in language. The presence of real or apparent teleology in explanations of natural selection is a controversial aspect of the [[philosophy of biology]], not least for its echoes of natural theology.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |author-link=Douglas J.

===Natural theology===
{{main|Natural theology}}

Before Darwin, [[natural theology]] both assumed the existence of God and used the appearance of function in nature to argue for the existence of God.&lt;ref name=Ayala/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; The English [[parson-naturalist]] [[John Ray]] stated that his intention was "to illustrate the glory of God in the knowledge of the works of nature or creation".&lt;ref name=Armstrong2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=Patrick |title=The English Parson-Naturalist |publisher=Gracewing |year=2000 |page=46 |isbn=978-0-85244-516-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural theology presented forms of the [[teleological argument]] or argument from design, namely that organs functioned well for their apparent purpose, so they were well-designed, so they must have been designed by a benevolent creator. For example, the eye had the function of seeing, and contained features like the [[iris (eye)|iris]] and [[lens (eye)|lens]] that assisted with seeing; therefore, ran the argument, it had been designed for that purpose.&lt;ref name=Ayala&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ayala |first=Francisco J. |author-link=Francisco J.

===Goal-directed evolution===
{{main|Orthogenesis|Vitalism}}

Religious thinkers and biologists have repeatedly supposed that evolution was driven by some kind of life force, a philosophy known as [[vitalism]], and have often supposed that it had some kind of goal or direction (towards which the life force was striving, if they also believed in that), known as [[orthogenesis]] or evolutionary progress. Such goal-directedness implies a long-term teleological force; some supporters of orthogenesis considered it to be a spiritual force, while others held that it was purely biological. For example, the [[embryologist]] [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] believed in a teleological force in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, Marcello. (2013). ''Biosemiotics: Information, Codes and Signs in Living Systems''. Nova Science Publishers. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-1-60021-612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Eric Paul. (2005).

Peter Lang. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualist philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]] linked orthogenesis with [[vitalism]], arguing for a creative force in evolution known as ''[[élan vital]]'' in his book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (1907).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J]]. (1992). ''The Eclipse of Darwinism: Anti-Darwinian Evolution Theories in the Decades around 1900''. The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 116–117. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-4391-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[biophysicist]] [[Pierre Lecomte du Noüy]] and the botanist [[Edmund Ware Sinnott]] developed vitalist evolutionary philosophies known as ''[[telefinalism]]'' and ''[[telism]]'' respectively. Their views were heavily criticized as non-scientific;&lt;ref name="Koch 1957"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koch |first1=Leo Francis |year=1957 |title=Vitalistic-Mechanistic Controversy |journal=[[The Scientific Monthly]] |volume=85 |issue=5|pages=245–255 |bibcode=1957SciMo..85..245K }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[palaeontologist]] [[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued that Du Noüy and Sinnott were promoting religious versions of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord. (1964). ''Evolutionary Theology: The New Mysticism''. In ''This View of Life: The World of an Evolutionist''. Harcourt, Brace &amp; World. pp. 213–233&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jesuit]] [[paleontologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] argued that evolution was aiming for a supposed spiritual "[[Omega Point]]" in what he called "directed additivity".&lt;ref name="Lane 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=David H. |year=1996 |title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age |publisher=Mercer University Press |pages=60–64 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Chardin, Pierre Teilhard.

{{main|Natural selection|Evolution}}

[[Natural selection]], introduced in 1859 as the central mechanism{{efn|Darwin also introduced a second mechanism, [[sexual selection]], to explain traits such as the colourful "tail" train of the [[peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |author-link=Charles Darwin |date=1859 |title=On the Origin of Species |edition=1st |page=89 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} of [[evolution]] by [[Charles Darwin]], is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in [[phenotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmer |first1=Carl |author-link1=Carl Zimmer |last2=Emlen |first2=Douglas J. |author-link2=Douglas Emlen |year=2013 |title=Evolution: Making Sense of Life |edition=1st |publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers |isbn=978-1-936221-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism directly implies evolution, a change in [[Heredity|heritable]] [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] of a [[population]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strickberger's Evolution |edition=4th |author1=Hall, Brian K. |author2=Hallgrímsson, Benedikt |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |date=2008 |pages=4–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrDD3cyA09kC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=978-1-4496-4722-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation===
[[File:Sinornithosaurus IVPP V12811.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--aspect for low image--&gt;|Feathers today serve the function of [[bird flight|flight]], but they were co-opted rather than [[adaptation|adapted]] for this task, having evolved for an earlier purpose in [[theropods]] like ''[[Sinornithosaurus|Sinornithosaurus millenii]]'', perhaps [[Thermal insulation|insulation]].]]
{{main|Adaptation|Function (biology)}}

A trait which persists in a population is often assumed by biologists to have been selected for in the course of evolution, raising the question of how the trait achieves this. Biologists call any such mechanism the function of the trait, using phrases like "A [[Function (biology)|function]] of [[stotting]] by antelopes is to [[signalling theory|communicate to predators]] that they have been detected",&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web |title=Teleological Notions in Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=28 July 2016 |date=18 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "The [[primate]] [[hand]] is designed (by natural selection) for grasping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primates - marmosets, monkeys, apes, lemurs, humans|url=http://www.nhptv.org/wild/primates.asp |publisher=NHPTV |access-date=28 July 2016 |quote=The hands and feet of all primates, except for humans, are designed for grasping. Humans have hands designed for grasping, but not feet! Humans have opposable thumbs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[adaptation]] is an observable structure or other feature of an organism (for example, an [[enzyme]]) generated by natural selection to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the [[hypothesis]] that [[feather]]s are adaptations for [[bird flight]]. That would require three things: that the trait of having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living [[birds]]. However, there is also a historical question, namely, did the trait arise at the same time as bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: [[theropod]] [[feathered dinosaur|dinosaurs had feathers]], but many of them did not fly.&lt;ref name=Berkeley&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Evolution: Qualifying as an adaptation |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/side_0_0/qualifying_01 |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |access-date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brusatte, Stephen L.|author2=Lloyd, Graeme T.|author3=Wang, Steve C.|author4=Norell, Mark A. |year=2014 |title=Gradual assembly of avian body plan culminated in rapid rates of evolution across the dinosaur-bird transition |journal=Current Biology |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=2386–2392  |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.034 |pmid=25264248|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers can be described as an [[exaptation]], having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as [[Thermal insulation|insulation]].

Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] argued, that biologists agree with [[Voltaire]]'s [[Doctor Pangloss]] in his 1759 satire ''[[Candide]]'' that this is "the best of all possible worlds", in other words that every trait is perfectly suited to its functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gould, Stephen J. |author1-link=Stephen J.

[[File:Louis George Meistergraveurin 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Watchmaker analogy]] argues that the presence of a complex mechanism like a watch implies the existence of a conscious designer.]]

Secondly, teleology is linked to the pre-Darwinian idea of [[natural theology]], that the natural world gives evidence of the [[intelligent design|conscious design]] and beneficent intentions of a creator, as in the writings of John Ray.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;  [[William Derham]] continued Ray's tradition with books such as his 1713 ''Physico-Theology'' and his 1714 ''[[Astro-Theology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weber, A. S. |title=Nineteenth-Century Science: An Anthology |publisher=Broadview Press |date=2000 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They in turn influenced [[William Paley]] who wrote a detailed [[teleological argument]] for God in 1802, ''[[Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paley |first=William |author-link=William Paley |title=Natural Theology |date=2006 |orig-year=1802 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the [[Watchmaker analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology |date=2013 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[creationism]], along with a vitalist life-force and directed orthogenetic evolution, has been rejected by most biologists.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

Thirdly, attributing purposes to adaptations risks confusion with popular forms of [[Lamarckism]] where animals in particular have been supposed to influence their own evolution through their intentions, though Lamarck himself spoke rather of habits of use, and the belief that his thinking was teleological has been challenged.&lt;ref name=Mayr1992/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkhardt2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burkhardt |first1=Richard W. |title=Lamarck, Evolution, and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters |journal=Genetics |volume=194 |issue=4 |year=2013 |pages=793–805 |doi=10.1534/genetics.113.151852|pmid=23908372 |pmc=3730912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bednarczyk 2009 pp. 31–98"&gt;{{citation |last=Bednarczyk |first=A |title=&amp;#91;Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829). A dispute on the mechanism of evolution. On the bicentenary of the publication of Philosophie Zoologique (1809)&amp;#93;|journal=Kwartalnik Historii Nauki I Techniki |volume=54 |issue=3–4 |year=2009 |issn=0023-589X |pmid=20481104 |language=pl |pages=31–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourthly, the teleological explanation of adaptation is uncomfortable because it seems to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; because it seems to attribute the action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test [[Empirical evidence|empirically]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

A fifth reason concerns students rather than researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then the use of teleological language by scientists may act as an obstacle to students when [[Teaching evolution|learning about natural selection]]. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gonzalez Galli |first1=Leonardo Martin |last2=Meinardi |first2=Elsa N. |title=The Role of Teleological Thinking in Learning the Darwinian Model of Evolution |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=145–152 |doi=10.1007/s12052-010-0272-7|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removable teleological shorthand===

Statements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something "in order to" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology, even though that is not their intention.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite book |author=Reiss, John O. |date=2009 |title=Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker |publisher=University of California Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent teleology by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection;&lt;ref name=Reiss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Depew |first1=David J. |title= Is Evolutionary Biology Infected with Invalid Teleological Reasoning?|journal= Philosophy and Theory in Biology|date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=20160629 |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0002.005|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |date=1987 |title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design |url=https://archive.org/details/blindwatchmaker00rich |url-access=registration |publisher=W W Norton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers of biology such as [[James G. Lennox]] have argued that Darwin was a teleologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=James G. Lennox |author=Lennox, James G. |date=1993 |title=Darwin was a Teleologist |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=409–421 |doi=10.1007/bf00857687|s2cid=170767015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others like [[Michael Ghiselin]] described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions, and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and actually being teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00850377 |last1=Ghiselin |first1=Michael T. |author-link=Michael Ghiselin |s2cid=170997321 |year=1994 |title=Darwin's language may seem teleological, but his thinking is another matter |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=489–492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Heads, on the other hand, describes a change in Darwin's thinking about evolution that can be traced from the first volume of ''On the Origin of Species'' to later volumes.  For Heads, Darwin was originally a far more teleological thinker, but over time, "learned to avoid teleology."  Heads cites a letter Darwin wrote in 1872, in which he downplayed the role of natural selection as a causal force on its own in explaining biological adaptation, and instead gave more weight to "laws of growth," that operate [without the aid of natural selection].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heads|first=Michael|date=June 2009|title=Darwin's changing views on evolution: from centres of origin and teleology to vicariance and incomplete lineage sorting|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1018–1026|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02127.x|issn=0305-0270|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Askland, from the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] claims that unlike [[transhumanism]], an ideology that aims to improve the [[human condition]], which he asserts is "wholly teleological", Darwinian evolution is not teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://web.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf |author=Askland, Andrew |title=The Misnomer of Transhumanism as Directed Evolution |journal=International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=2011 |pages=71–78 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422034847/https://web.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf |archive-date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of [[shorthand]] for describing any function which offers an evolutionary advantage through natural selection. For example, the zoologist S. H. P. Madrell wrote that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madrell, S.H.P. |date=1998 |title=Why are there no insects in the open sea? |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=201 |issue=17 |pages=2461–2464|doi=10.1242/jeb.201.17.2461 |pmid=9698580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irreducible teleology===

Other philosophers of biology argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of rewording. Francisco Ayala specified three separate situations in which teleological explanations are appropriate. First, if the agent consciously anticipates the goal of their own action; for example the behavior of picking up a pen can be explained by reference to the agent's desire to write. Ayala extends this type of teleological explanation to non-human animals by noting that A deer running away from a mountain lion. . . has at least the appearance of purposeful behavior."&lt;ref name="Ayala 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ayala |first=Francisco J. |date=March 1970 |title=Teleological Explanations in Evolutionary Biology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1086/288276 |s2cid=84638701 |issn=0031-8248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, teleological explanations are useful for systems that have a mechanism for self-regulation despite fluctuations in environment; for example, the self-regulation of body temperature in animals. Finally, they are appropriate "in reference to structures anatomically and physiologically designed to perform a certain function. "&lt;ref name="Ayala 1970"/&gt;

Ayala, relying on work done by the philosopher [[Ernest Nagel]], also rejects the idea that teleological arguments are inadmissible because they cannot be causal. For Nagel, teleological arguments must be consistent because they can always be reformulated as non-teleological arguments. The difference between the two is, for Ayala, merely one of emphasis. Nagel writes that while teleological arguments focus on "the consequences for a given system of a constituent part or process," the equivalent non-teleological arguments focus on ""some of the conditions ... under which the system persists in its characteristic organization and activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The structure of science: Problems in the logic of scientific explanation |last=Nagel |first=Ernest |author-link=Ernest Nagel |date=1961 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World |oclc=874878031}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] argued that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of.&lt;ref name="Ayala1977"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayala |first=Francisco J. |author-link=Francisco J. Ayala |date=1977 |title=Teleological explanations |editor=Dobzhansky, T. |editor-link=Theodosius Dobzhansky |work=Evolution |publisher=W.H. Freeman |pages=497–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayala |first=Francisco |author-link=Francisco J. Ayala |year=1998 |title=Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology |editor=Allen, Colin |editor2=Bekoff, Marc |work=Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0262510974}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Neander]] similarly argued that the modern concept of [[function (biology)|biological 'function']] depends on [[natural selection]]. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. We decide whether an [[appendage]] has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Neander, Karen (1998). "Functions as Selected Effects: The Conceptual Analyst's Defense," in C. Allen, M. Bekoff &amp; G. Lauder (Eds.), ''Nature's Purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology'' (pp. 313–333). The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] likewise stated that "adaptedness&amp;nbsp;... is an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' goal-seeking."&lt;ref name="Mayr1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Ernst W. |author-link=Ernst Mayr |date=1992 |title=The idea of teleology |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=117–135 |doi=10.2307/2709913 |jstor=2709913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angela Breitenbach, looking at the question of teleology in biology from a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] perspective, argues that teleology is important as "a [[heuristic]] in the search for causal explanations of nature and&amp;nbsp;... an inevitable [[analogy|analogical]] perspective on living beings." In her view of Kant, teleology implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breitenbach |first=Angela |title=Teleology in Biology : A Kantian Perspective |date=2009 |pages=31–56 |url=http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/breitenbach/breitenbach-teleologybiology.pdf |journal=[[Kant Yearbook]] |volume=2009 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/9783110196672.31 |s2cid=171216322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Pittendrigh]] coined the similar term '[[teleonomy]]' for apparently goal-directed biological phenomena. For Pittendrigh, the notion of 'adaptation' in biology, however it is defined, necessarily "connote that aura of design, purpose, or end-directedness, which has, since the time of Aristotle, seemed to characterize the living thing" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angel |first=J. Lawrence |date=June 1961 |title=Behavior and evolution. By Anne Roe and George G. Simpson, eds. vii + 557 pp. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1958 |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=218–219 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330190215 |issn=0002-9483}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association with Aristotle, however, is problematic, because it meant that the study of adaptation would inevitably be bound up with teleological explanations. Pittendrigh sought to preserve the aspect of design and purpose in biological systems, while denying that this design can be understood as a causal principle. The confusion, he says, would be removed if we described these systems "by some other term, like 'teleonomic,' in order to emphasize that the recognition and description of end-directedness does not carry a commitment to Aristotelian teleology as an efficient causal principle."&lt;ref name=Pittendrigh&gt;{{cite book |last=Pittendrigh |first=Colin S. |author-link=Colin Pittendrigh |title=Adaptation, natural selection, and behavior |work=Behavior and Evolution |editor1=Roe, A. |editor2=Simpson, George Gaylord |editor2-link=George Gaylord Simpson |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1958 |pages=390–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] criticised Pittendrigh's confusion of Aristotle's [[four causes]], arguing that evolution only involved the material and formal but not the efficient cause.{{efn |Both Pittendrigh and Mayr endorsed teleology in biology as an inherent part of evolutionary thinking.&lt;ref name=Pittendrigh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr/&gt;}} Mayr proposed to use the term only for "systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information."&lt;ref name=Mayr&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |author-link=Ernst Mayr |chapter=Cause and effect in biology |editor=Lerner, D. |title=Cause and effect |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/causeeffect00lern |chapter-url-access=registration |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |date=1965 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/causeeffect00lern/page/33 33–50]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William C. Wimsatt]] affirmed that the teleologicality of the language of biology and other fields derives from the logical structure of their background theories, and not merely from the use of teleological locutions such as "function" and "in order to". He stated that "To replace talk about function by talk about selection [...] is not to eliminate teleology but to rephrase it". However, Wimsatt argues that this thought does not mean an appeal to [[backwards causation]], [[vitalism]], [[entelechy]], or [[Antireductionism|anti-reductionist]] sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wimsatt |first=William C. |author-link=William C.

The biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] observed that "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hull |first=D. |title=Philosophy of Biological Science |url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofbiol0000hull |url-access=registration |publisher=Prentice-Hall |date=1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1974) Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Volume XIV, pages 91–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telescoping generations''' can occur in [[parthenogenetic]] species, such as [[aphid]]s or other life forms that have the ability to reproduce without ovum fertilization. This occurrence is characterized by a [[viviparous]] female having a daughter growing inside her that is also parthenogenetically pregnant with a daughter cell.

This pattern of reproduction can also occur in certain [[mite]]s that are not parthenogenetic, e.g. ''[[Adactylidium]]'', in which the young hatch and mate within the mother, eating her from the inside and then escaping; in some species the males never escape, and in others they die shortly afterwards. However, the resulting inbreeding has consequences much like those of parthenogenesis, and the females are not actually pregnant on hatching but become pregnant before emerging into free living.

'''Temperature-sensitive mutants''' are variants of genes that allow normal function of the organism at low temperatures, but altered function at higher temperatures.  Cold sensitive mutants are variants of [[gene]]s that allow normal function of the organism at higher temperatures, but altered function at low temperatures.

==Mechanism==
Most temperature-sensitive mutations affect [[protein]]s, and cause loss of [[protein function]] at the non-permissive temperature. The permissive temperature is one at which the protein typically can [[Protein folding|fold]] properly, or remain properly folded. At higher temperatures, the protein is unstable and ceases to function properly. These mutations are usually [[recessive]] in [[diploid]] organisms. Temperature sensitive mutants arrange a reversible mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Varadarajan|first1=R.|last2=Nagarajaram|first2=H. A.|last3=Ramakrishnan|first3=C.|date=1996-11-26|title=A procedure for the prediction of temperature-sensitive mutants of a globular protein based solely on the amino acid sequence|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=93|issue=24|pages=13908–13913|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.24.13908|issn=0027-8424|pmid=8943034|pmc=19465|bibcode=1996PNAS...9313908V|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are able to reduce particular gene products at varying stages of growth and are easily done by changing the temperature of growth.

==Permissive temperature==
The permissive temperature is the temperature at which a temperature-sensitive mutant [[gene product]] takes on a normal, functional [[phenotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Permissive_temperature|title=Permissive temperature|publisher=Biology-Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a temperature-sensitive mutant is grown in a permissive condition, the [[mutant|mutated]] gene product behaves normally (meaning that the phenotype is not observed), even if there is a mutant [[allele]] present. This results in the survival of the cell or organism, as if it were a [[wild type]] strain. In contrast, the nonpermissive temperature or restrictive temperature is the temperature at which the mutant phenotype is observed.

Temperature sensitive mutations are usually missense mutations, which then will harbor the function of a specified necessary gene at the standard, permissive, low temperature. It will alternatively lack the function at a rather high, non-permissive, temperature and display a hypomorphic (partial loss of gene function) and a middle, semi-permissive, temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ben-Aroya|first1=Shay|last2=Pan|first2=Xuewen|last3=Boeke|first3=Jef D.|last4=Hieter|first4=Philip|date=2010|title=Making temperature-sensitive mutants|journal=Methods in Enzymology|volume=470|pages=181–204|doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(10)70008-2|issn=0076-6879|pmc=2957654|pmid=20946811|isbn=9780123751720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in research ==
Temperature-sensitive mutants are useful in biological research. They allow the study of essential processes required for the survival of the cell or organism.  Mutations to essential genes are generally lethal and hence temperature-sensitive mutants enable researchers to induce the phenotype at the restrictive temperatures and study the effects. The temperature-sensitive phenotype could be expressed during a specific developmental stage to study the effects.

=== Examples ===
In the late 1970s, the [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|budding yeast]] [[secretory pathway]], essential for viability of the cell and for growth of new buds, was dissected using temperature-sensitive mutants, resulting in the identification of twenty-three essential genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Novick|first1=P.|last2=Field|first2=C.|last3=Schekman|first3=R.|date=August 1980|title=Identification of 23 complementation groups required for post-translational events in the yeast secretory pathway|journal=Cell|volume=21|issue=1|pages=205–215|issn=0092-8674|pmid=6996832|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(80)90128-2|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, several temperature-sensitive mutant genes were identified in the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]], such as ''shibire&lt;sup&gt;ts&lt;/sup&gt;'', which led to the first genetic dissection of synaptic function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Yoshihara M, Ito K|date=2012|title=Acute Genetic Manipulation of Neuronal Activity for the Functional Dissection of Neural Circuits — A Dream Come True for the Pioneers of Behavioral Genetics|journal=Journal of Neurogenetics|type=Review|publisher=Informa Healthcare USA|volume=26|issue=1|pages=43&amp;ndash;52|doi=10.3109/01677063.2012.663429|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online|pmc=3357893|pmid=22420407}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s, the [[Heat shock response|heat shock]] [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] [[hsp70]] was used in temperature-modulated gene expression in the fruit fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Brand M, Jarman AP, Jan LY, Jan YN|date=1993|title=''asense'' is a ''Drosophila'' neural precursor gene and is capable of initiating sense organ formation|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/119/1/1.full.pdf|journal=Development|volume=119|issue=1|pages=1&amp;ndash;17|doi=10.1242/dev.119.1.1|pmid=8565817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteriophage===

An infection of an ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' host cell by a [[Escherichia virus T4|bacteriophage (phage) T4]] temperature sensitive (ts) conditionally [[Lethal alleles|lethal mutant]] at a high restrictive temperature generally leads to no phage growth.  However, a co-infection under restrictive conditions with two ''ts'' mutants defective in different genes generally leads to robust growth because of intergenic [[complementation (genetics)|complementation]].  The discovery of ''ts'' mutants of phage T4, and the employment of such mutants in complementation tests contributed to the identification of many of the genes in this organism.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar RS, Epstein RH. The genetics of a bacterial virus. Sci Am. 1965 Feb;212:70-8. doi: 10.1038/scientificamerican0265-70. {{PMID|14272117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because multiple copies of a polypeptide specified by a gene often form multimers, mixed infections with two different ''ts'' mutants defective in the same gene often leads to mixed multimers and partial restoration of function, a phenomenon referred to as intragenic complementation.  Intragenic complementation of ''ts'' mutants defective in the same gene can provide information on the structural organization of the multimer.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Edgar RS, Denhardt GH. Intragenic complementation among temperature sensitive mutants of bacteriophage T4D.  Genetics. 1965 Jun;51(6):987-1002. {{PMID|14337770}}; PMCID: PMC1210828.&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth of phage ''ts'' mutants under partially restrictive conditions has been used to identify the functions of genes.  Thus genes employed in the [[DNA repair|repair of DNA damages]] were identified,&lt;ref&gt;Baldy MW. The UV sensitivity of some early-function temperature-sensitive mutants of phage T4. Virology. 1970 Feb;40(2):272-87. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(70)90403-4. {{PMID|4909413}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldy MW, Strom B, Bernstein H. Repair of alkylated bacteriophage T4 deoxyribonucleic acid by a mechanism involving polynucleotide ligase. J Virol. 1971 Mar;7(3):407-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.7.3.407-408.1971. {{PMID|4927528}}; PMCID: PMC356131.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as genes affecting [[genetic recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H. The effect on recombination of mutational defects in the DNA-polymerase and deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase of phage T4D. Genetics. 1967 Aug;56(4):755-69. {{PMID|6061665}}; PMCID: PMC1211652.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H. Repair and recombination in phage T4. I. Genes affecting recombination. Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 1968;33:325-331. doi:10.1101/sqb.1968.033.01.037&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, growing a ''ts'' DNA repair mutant at an intermediate temperature will allow some progeny phage to be produced.  However, if that ''ts'' mutant is irradiated with UV light, its survival will be more strongly reduced compared the reduction of survival of irradiated wild-type phage T4.

Conditional lethal mutants able to grow at high temperatures, but unable to grow at low temperatures, were also isolated in phage T4.&lt;ref&gt;Scotti PD. A new class of temperature conditional lethal mutants of bacteriophage T4D. Mutat Res. 1968 Jul-Aug;6(1):1-14. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(68)90098-5. {{PMID|4885498}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These cold sensitive mutants defined a discrete set of genes, some of which had been previously identified by other types of conditional lethal mutants.

'''Temporins''' are a family of [[peptide]]s isolated originally from the skin secretion of the European red frog, ''[[Rana temporaria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Eur J Biochem  |date=Dec 15, 1996 |volume=242 |issue=3 |pages=788–792 |title=Temporins, antimicrobial peptides from the European red frog Rana temporaria |author1=Simmaco M |author2=Mignogna G |author3=Canofeni S |author4=Miele R |author5=Mangoni ML |author6=Barra D |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0788r.x|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peptides belonging to the '''temporin''' family have been isolated also from closely related North American frogs, such as ''Rana sphenocephala''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holden|first1=Whitney|last2=Reinert|first2=Laura K|last3=Hanlon|first3=Shane M|last4=Parris|first4=Matthew J|last5=Rollins-Smith|first5=Louise A|date=January 2015|title=Development of antimicrobial peptide defenses of southern leopard frogs, Rana sphenocephala, against the pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X14002286|journal=Developmental &amp; Comparative Immunology|volume=48|issue=1|page=65-75|doi=10.1016/j.dci.2014.09.003|pmid=25218643|access-date=16 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[elephant]]s, temporin is secreted by [[temporal bone|temporal]] [[exocrine gland|glands]] during the period of [[musth]].  It contains [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s (notably [[cholesterol]]), [[phenol]]s, [[cresol]]s and [[sesquiterpene]]s (notably [[farnesol]] and its derivatives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The living elephants: evolutionary ecology, behavior, and conservation |last=Sukumar |first=R |year=2003 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780195107784 |page=[https://archive.org/details/livingelephantse00suku_0/page/155 155] |url= https://archive.org/details/livingelephantse00suku_0 |url-access=registration |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not related to temporins that are antimicrobial peptides.

In old Sanskrit texts, it is referred to as [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] fluid ({{lang|sa-Latn|dāna}}, or {{lang|sa-Latn|mada}}) and is considered to be a symbol of potency and vigour:&lt;ref&gt;Bana, ''Kadambari''. Transl. P. Rajappa, Penguin Books 2010, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the point of view of ancient Indian elephant science ({{lang|sa-Latn|gajaśāstra}}), temporin is not a direct symptom of rut.&lt;ref name="NilakanthaEdgerton1931"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nilakantha|author2=Franklin Edgerton|author2-link=Franklin Edgerton|title=The Elephant-lore of the Hindus: The Elephant-sport (Matanga-lila) of Nilakantha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6-41berm3IC|year=1931|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0005-2}}, pp. 29-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JenB Marking Territory.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A male [[South China tiger]] scent-marking his territory]]

In [[ethology]], '''territory''' is the sociographical area that an [[animal]] consistently defends against [[conspecificity|conspecific]] [[competition (biology)|competition]] (or, occasionally, against animals of other [[species]]) using [[agonistic behavior]]s or (less commonly) real physical [[aggression]].  Animals that actively defend territories in this way are referred to as being '''territorial''' or displaying '''territorialism'''.

Territoriality is only shown by a minority of species. More commonly, an individual or a group of animals occupies an area that it habitually uses but does not necessarily defend; this is called its [[home range]]. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, and in these overlap areas the groups tend to avoid each other rather than seeking to confront and expel each other.  Within the home range there may be a ''core area'' that no other individual group uses, but, again, this is as a result of avoidance.

==Function==
The ultimate function of animals inhabiting and defending a territory is to increase the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals expressing the behaviour. Fitness in this biological sense relates to the ability of an animal to survive and raise young. The proximate functions of territory defense vary. For some animals, the reason for such protective behaviour is to acquire and protect food sources, nesting sites, mating areas, or to attract a mate.

==Types and size==
Among birds, territories have been classified as six types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdterritories.html|author=Anon.|title=Ornithology: territoriality and coloniality|access-date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Type A: An 'all-purpose territory' in which all activities occur, e.g. courtship, mating, nesting and foraging
*Type B: A mating and nesting territory, not including most of the area used for foraging.
*Type C: A nesting territory which includes the nest plus a small area around it. Common in colonial waterbirds.
*Type D: A pairing and mating territory. The type of territory defended by males in lekking species.
*Type E: Roosting territory. 
*Type F: Winter territory which typically includes foraging areas and roost sites. May be equivalent (in terms of location) to the Type A territory, or for a migratory species, may be on the wintering grounds.

Reports of territory size can be confused by a lack of distinction between home range and the defended territory. The size and shape of a territory can vary according to its purpose, season, the amount and quality of resources it contains, or the geography. The size is usually a compromise of resource needs, defense costs, predation pressure and reproductive needs.

Some species of [[squirrels]] may claim as much as {{convert|10|ha}} of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/squirrel-behavior-territory-4745.html|title=Squirrel behaviour and territory|author=Turpin, K.|access-date=June 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615123759/http://animals.pawnation.com/squirrel-behavior-territory-4745.html|archive-date=June 15, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For [[European badger]]s, a home range may be as small as {{convert|30|ha}} in a good rural habitat, but as large as {{convert|300|ha}} in a poor habitat. On average, a territory may be approximately {{convert|50|ha}}, with main setts normally at least {{convert|500|m}} apart. In urban areas, territories can be as small as {{convert|5|ha}}, if they can obtain enough food from bird tables, [[food waste]] or artificial feeding in suburban gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badgerland.co.uk/animals/family/territories.html|title=Territories|author=Anon.|publisher=www.badgerland.co.uk|access-date=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'') have highly variable territory sizes, ranging from less than {{convert|4000|ha}} in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area|Ngorongoro Crater]] to over {{convert|100000|ha}} in the [[Kalahari Desert|Kalahari]].&lt;ref&gt;Kruuk, H., (1972). ''The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour''. University of California Press, {{ISBN|0226455084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, [[golden eagles]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') have territories of {{convert|9000|ha}}, [[least flycatcher]]s' (''Empidonax minimus'') territories are about {{convert|600|m2}} and [[gulls]] have territories of only a few square centimetres in the immediate vicinity of the nest.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Territoriality.html|title=Territoriality|author=Ehrlich, P.R., Dobkin, D.S. and Wheye, D.|year=1998|access-date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Territories can be linear. [[Sanderling]]s (''Calidris alba'') forage on beaches and sandflats. When on beaches, they feed either in flocks or individual territories of 10 to 120 metres of shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Connors | first2 = P.G. | last3 = Pitelka | first3 = F.A. | year = 1979 | title = Territory size in wintering Sanderlings: the effects of prey abundance and intruder density | url =https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v096n03/p0551-p0561.pdf | journal = Auk | volume = 96 | pages = 551–561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time to develop territories varies between animals. The [[marine iguana]] (''Amblyrhynchus cristatus'') is a [[Lek mating|lekking]] reptile. Males start to establish small display territories two months ahead of the mating season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Partecke | first1 = J. | last2 = von Haeseler | first2 = A. | last3 = Wikelski | first3 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Territory establishment in lekking marine iguanas, Amblyrhynchus cristatus: support for the hotshot mechanism | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 51| issue = 6| pages = 579–587| doi = 10.1007/s00265-002-0469-z | s2cid = 2132629 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retaining a territory==
Rather than retaining a territory simply by fighting, for some animals this can be a 3-stage process. Many animals create "sign-posts" to advertise their territory. Sometimes these sign-posts are on the boundary thereby demarcating the territory, or, may be scattered throughout the territory. These communicate to other animals that the territory is occupied and may also communicate additional information such as the sex, reproductive status or [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] status of the territory-holder. Sign-posts may communicate information by [[olfactory]], auditory, or visual means, or a combination of these. If an intruder progresses further into the territory beyond the sign-posts and encounters the territory-holder, both animals may begin [[ritualized aggression]] toward each other. This is a series of stylised postures, vocalisations, displays, etc. which function to solve the territory dispute without actual fighting as this could injure either or both animals. Ritualized aggression often ends by one of the animals fleeing (generally the intruder). If this does not happen, the territory may be defended by actual fighting, although this is generally a last resort.

====Scent marking====
{{Commons category|Scent marking}}

Territorial scent marking may involve behaviours specific to this activity.

This posture is exclusive to alpha wolves of either sex, although the alpha male does this most often. The alpha female usually urinates on a scent post that her breeding partner has just urinated on, although during the mating season, the female may first urinate on the ground.

Visual sign-posts may be a short-term or long-term mode of advertising a territory. Short-term communication includes the colouration or behaviour of the animal, which can only be communicated when the resident is present. Other animals may use more long-term visual signals such as faecal deposits, or marks on the vegetation or ground. Visual marking of territory is often combined with other modes of animal communication.

Some animals have prominent "badges" or visual displays to advertise their territory, often in combination with scent marking or auditory signals. Male [[European robins]] are noted for their highly aggressive territorial behaviour. They attack other males that stray into their territories, and have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation. Such attacks sometimes lead to fatalities, accounting for up to 10% of adult robin deaths in some areas.&lt;ref name=RSPBterr&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/r/robin/territory.asp |title= The RSPB-Robin:Territory|access-date=2008-05-17|work=RSPB website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red breast of the bird (i.e. badge) is highly visible when it sings (vocal marking) at the boundary of its territory. The ring-tailed lemur (''Lemur catta'') advertises its territory with urine scent marks. When it is urinating for marking purposes, it holds its extremely distinctive tail high in the air adding a visual component to the advertisement; when it is urinating for eliminative purposes, its tail is only slightly raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palagi | first1 = E. | last2 = Dapporto | first2 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Urine marking and urination in Lemur catta: a comparison of design features | url = http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf43/anzf43-280.pdf | journal = Ann.

There may be 20 to 30 of these piles to alert passing rhinoceroses that it is occupied territory. Other males may deposit dung over the piles of another and subsequently the sign-post grows larger and larger. Such a dung heap can become up to five metres wide and one metre high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/species_of_rhino/greater_one-horned_rhinos/factfile_greater_one-horned_rhino|title=Factfile:Greater one horned rhino|author=von Houwald, F.|access-date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defecating, [[Indian rhinoceros|greater one-horned rhino]]s scratch their hind feet in the dung. By continuing to walk, they “transport” their own smell around the paths, thus establishing a scent-marked trail. Another method of visually marking their territory is wiping their horns on bushes or the ground and scraping with the feet, although this is likely combined with the smell of the marking animal. The territorial male scrape-marks every {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} or so around its territory boundary.

After leaving a urination mark, some animals scrape or dig the ground nearby, thereby leaving a visual advertisement of the territory. This includes domestic [[dog]]s.

Several species scratch or chew trees leaving a visual mark of their territory. This is sometimes combined with rubbing on the tree which may leave tufts of fur. These include the [[Canada lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/nwep3d.htm|title=chemical communication|publisher=NatureWorks|access-date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bear-tracker.com/blackbearscentmarkingttrees.html|title=Black Bear Marking Trees|author= Cabrera, K.A.|year=2013|access-date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burst, T.L. and Pelton, M.R., ( ).

Bear Res. and Manage., 5: 45-53 [http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_5/Burst___Pelton_Vol_5.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Many animals have scent glands in their paws or deposit fur during tree-marking, so tree-marking may be a combination of both visual and olfactory advertising of the territory. The male ring-tailed lemur has a specialised adaptation to assist in leaving visual/olfactory territorial marks. On their inner forearm (antebrachial) is a scent gland which is covered by a [[Spur (zoology)|spur]]. In a behaviour called "spur marking", they grasp the substrate, usually a small sapling, and drag the spur over it, cutting into the wood and spreading the gland's secretions. When on the ground, ring-tailed lemurs preferentially mark small saplings and when high in the trees, they usually mark small vertical branches.&lt;ref name="Cawthon Lang" /&gt;

[[European wildcat]]s (''Felis silvestris'') deposit their faecal marks on plants with high visual conspicuousness that enhances the visual effectiveness of the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Piñeiro | first1 = A. | last2 = Barja | first2 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The plant physical features selected by wildcats as signal posts: an economic approach to fecal marking | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 99 | issue = 10| pages = 801–809 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-012-0962-9 | pmid=22926138| s2cid = 2309455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals use vocalisations to advertise their territory. These are short-term signals transmitted only when the animal is present, but can travel long distances and over varied habitats. Examples of animals which use auditory signals include birds, frogs and canids.

===Ritualized aggression===
{{Main|Ritualized aggression}}
[[File:Catch cats 3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Two domestic cats posturing during ritualized aggression over a territory]]
Animals use a range of behaviours to intimidate intruders and defend their territories, but without engaging in fights which are expensive in terms of energy and the risk of injury. This is [[ritualized aggression]]. Such defense frequently involves a graded series of behaviours or displays that include threatening gestures (such as vocalizations, spreading of wings or gill covers, lifting and presentation of claws, head bobbing, tail and body beating) and finally, direct attack.

===Defense===
Territories may be held by an individual, a [[mated pair|mated]] or unmated pair, or a group. Territoriality is not always a fixed behavioural characteristic of a species. For example, red foxes (''Vulpes vulpes'') either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with [[no fixed abode]].&lt;ref name="mac117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1987|p=117}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Which book or paper is intended here? Ref does not point anywhere--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Territories may vary with time (season), for example, [[European robin]]s defend territories as pairs during the breeding season but as individuals during the winter. Resource availability may cause changes in territoriality, for example, some [[nectarivore]]s defend territories only during the mornings when plants are richest in nectar. In species that do not form pair bonds, male and female territories are often independent, i.e. males defend territories only against other males and females only against other females. In this case, if the species is [[polygyny|polygynous]], one male territory probably contains several female territories, while in some [[polyandry|polyandrous]] species such as the [[northern jacana]], this situation is reversed.

==Strategies==
Animals may use several strategies to defend their territories.

The first [[Game theory#Biology|game theory model]] of fighting is known as the ''[[Chicken (game)|hawk-dove game]]''. This model pits a hawk strategy (always try to injure your opponent and only withdraw from the contest if an injury is received) against a dove strategy (always use a non-injurious display if the rival is another dove and always withdraw if the rival is a hawk).

Another strategy used in territory defence is the [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]]. In this model of aggression, two contestants compete for a resource by persisting while constantly accumulating costs over the time that the contest lasts. Strategically, the game is an auction in which the prize goes to the player with the highest bid, and each player pays the loser's low bid.

Some animals use a strategy termed the ''[[dear enemy effect]]'' in which two neighbouring territorial animals become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established and they are familiar to each other, but aggression toward unfamiliar animals remains unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, J., {1954}. Evolution and bird sociality. In: ''Evolution As a Process'' (Huxley, J., Hardy, A. and Ford, E., eds). London, Allen and Unwin. pp. 71-83&lt;/ref&gt; The converse of this is the ''[[nasty neighbour effect]]'' in which a territory-holder shows heightened aggression toward neighbouring territory-holders but unaffected aggression to unfamiliar animals or distant territory-holders. These contrasting strategies depend on which intruder (familiar or unfamiliar) poses the greatest threat to the resident territory-holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Müller | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Manser | first2 = M.B. | year = 2007 | title = 'Nasty neighbours' rather than 'dear enemies' in a social carnivore | journal = Proc. R. Soc. B | volume = 274 | issue = 1612| pages = 959–965 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0222| pmid = 17251103 | pmc = 2141673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In territory defence by groups of animals, ''[[reciprocal altruism]]'' can operate whereby the cost to the benefactor in helping defend the territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary.

==Resources defended==
An animal chooses its territory by deciding what part of its home range it will defend. In selecting a territory, the size and quality play crucial roles in determining an animal's habitat. Territory size generally tends to be no larger than the organism requires to survive, because defending a larger territory incurs greater energy, time and risk of injury costs. For some animals, the territory size is not the most important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of the defended territory.

Behavioural ecologists have argued that food distribution determines whether a species is territorial or not, however, this may be too narrow a perspective. Several other type of resource may be defended including partners, potential mates, offspring, nests or lairs, display areas or [[lek (animal behavior)|leks]]. Territoriality emerges where there is a focused resource that provides enough for the individual or group, within a boundary that is small enough to be defended without the expenditure of excessive effort. Territoriality is often most strong towards [[conspecifics]], as shown in the case of [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nursall|first=J.R.|title=Territoriality in Redlip blennies (Ophioblennius atlanticus-Pisces: Blenniidae)|journal=Journal of Zoology|year=1977|volume=182|issue=2|series=2|pages=205–223|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04156.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the conspecifics share exactly the same set of resources.

Several types of resource in a territory may be defended.
[[File:Vanellus vanellus mobbing Circus aeruginosus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A western marsh harrier is mobbed by a northern lapwing. The marsh harrier, a male, had been quartering the ground in which lapwing and redshank were nesting.]]

'''Food:''' Large solitary (or paired) carnivores, such as [[bear]]s and the bigger [[Bird of prey|raptors]] require an extensive protected area to guarantee their food supply. This territoriality only breaks down when there is a glut of food, for example when [[grizzly bear]]s are attracted to migrating [[salmon]].

Food related territoriality is least likely with insectivorous birds, where the food supply is plentiful but unpredictably distributed. [[Swift (bird)|Swift]]s rarely defend an area larger than the nest. Conversely, other insectivorous birds that occupy more constrained territories, such as the ground-nesting [[blacksmith lapwing]] may be very territorial, especially in the breeding season during which they not only threaten or attack many kinds of intruders, but have stereotyped display behaviour to deter conspecifics sharing neighbouring nesting spots.

The [[owl limpet]] (''Lottia gigantea'') is a large (up to 8&amp;nbsp;cm in length) limpet. It lives in association with an approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;cm^2 area of algal film in which its grazing marks can be seen, whereas the remainder of the rock surface is usually free of any visible film. These areas of algal film represent the territories of the Lottia; within them the animals do all their grazing. They keep their territories free of other organisms by shoving off any intruders: other Lottia, grazing limpets of the genus Acmaea, predatory snails, and sessile organisms such as anemones and barnacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1933604 | last1 = Stimson | first1 = J. |name-list-style=vanc | year = 1969 | title = Territoriality of the owl limpet ''Lottia gigantea'' | jstor = 1933604| journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 113–118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nests and offspring:''' Many birds, particularly seabirds, nest in dense communities but are nonetheless territorial in defending their nesting site to within the distance they can reach while brooding. This is necessary to prevent attacks on their own chicks or nesting material from neighbours. Commonly the resulting superimposition of the short-range repulsion onto the long-range attraction characteristically leads to the well-known roughly hexagonal spacing of nests. One gets a similar hexagonal spacing resulting from the territorial behaviour of gardening limpets such as species of [[Scutellastra]].&lt;ref&gt;Branch, G.M., Griffiths, C., Beckley, L.E., Branch, M.L.; Two Oceans. Pub. Struik, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-77007-772-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They vigorously defend their gardens of particular species of algae, that extend for perhaps 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm around the periphery of their shells.

The desert grass spider, ''[[Agelenopsis aperta]],'' often engages in fights over its territory and the most combative spiders have the largest territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Riechert|first1=Susan E.|author1-link= Susan Riechert |last2=Hedrick|first2=Ann V.|date=October 1993|title=A test for correlations among fitness-linked behavioural traits in the spider Agelenopsis aperta (Araneae, Agelenidae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1993.1243|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=46|issue=4|pages=669–675|doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1243|s2cid=53201859|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of penguin defend their nests from intruders trying to steal the pebbles from which the nest is constructed.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich" /&gt;

'''Mating opportunities:''' The striped mouse (''[[Rhabdomys]] pumilio'') is group living with one single breeding male and up to 4 communally breeding females per group. Groups typically contain several [[philopatric]] adult sons (and daughters) that are believed not to breed in their natal group and all group members participate in territorial defence. Males defend their territory using a nasty neignbour strategy. Group-living male breeders are nearly five times more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards strangers, leading to the prediction that neighbours are the most important competitors for paternity. Using a molecular parentage analysis it has been shown that 28% of offspring are sired by neighbouring males and only 7% by strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schradin | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = C. | last3 = Lindholm | first3 = A.K. | year = 2010 | title = The nasty neighbour in the striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) steals paternity and elicits aggression | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 7 | page = 19 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-7-19 | pmid = 20573184 | pmc = 2908079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain species of butterflies, such as the [[Australian painted lady]] butterfly and the [[Speckled wood (butterfly)|speckled wood butterfly]], the male defends territories that receptive females are likely to fly through such as sunny hilltops and sunspots on a forest's floor.&lt;ref name="Alcock and Gwynne, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alcock|first=John|author2=Gwynne Daryl |title=The mating system of Vanessa kershawi: Males defend landmark territories as mate encounter sites|journal=Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera|year=1988|volume=26|issue=1–4|pages=116–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=N.B.|title=Territorial defense in the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria): The resident always wins|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=1978|volume=26|pages=138–147|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(78)90013-1|citeseerx=10.1.1.513.4639|s2cid=7445027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Territory defence in male variegated pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon]] variegatus'') is dependent on the presence of females.

The responses of territorial male variegated pupfish, Cyprinodon variegatus, to neighbours, strangers and heterospecifics | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5479a743f87fa3a9ca4336f5da1567e1d1e14ed2| journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 453–462 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2087| s2cid = 53166315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Skylark]] (''Alauda arvensis''), playbacks of neighbour and stranger songs at three periods of the breeding season show that neighbours are dear enemies in the middle of the season, when territories are stable, but not at the beginning of the breeding season, during settlement and pair formation, nor at the end, when bird density increases due to the presence of young birds becoming independent. Thus, this dear enemy territoriality relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briefer | first1 = E. | last2 = Rybak | first2 = F. | last3 = Aubin | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis | url = https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=acwp_ena| journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 76 | issue = 4| pages = 1319–1325 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.06.017| s2cid = 21703019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of bees also exhibit territoriality to defend mating sites. For example, in ''[[Euglossa imperialis]],'' a non-social bee species, males have been observed to occasionally form aggregations of fragrance-rich territories, considered to be leks. These leks serve only a facultative purpose for this species, in which the more fragrance-rich sites there are, the greater the number of habitable territories. Since these territories are aggregated, females have a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate within the aggregation, giving females the power of [[mate choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimsey | first1 = Lynn Siri | year = 1980 | title = The behaviour of male orchid bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera, Insecta) and the question of leks | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 996–1004 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(80)80088-1| s2cid = 53161684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar behaviour is also observed in the ''[[Eulaema meriana]]'' orchid bee. Males in this species of bee show alternative behaviours of territoriality and transiency. Transient male bees did not defend territories, but instead flew from one territory to the other. They also did not engage in physical contact with the territorial males. On the other hand, territorial males patrolled an area around a tree and used the same territory for up to 49 days. It also appeared that they gave up territories to new males without violence. Males defend territories solely for mating, and no other resources such as fragrances, nests, nest construction materials, nectar, or pollen are found at these territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Male Territoriality and Alternative Male Behaviors in the Euglossine Bee, Eulaema meriana (Hymenoptera: Apidae)|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1991-10-01|pages = 421–437|volume = 64|issue = 4|first = David L.|last = Stern|jstor=25085309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single resource territories===
Although most territories contain multiple (potential) resources, some territories are defended for only one purpose. [[Common blackbird|European blackbirds]] may defend feeding territories that are distant from their nest sites, and in some species that form leks, for example in the [[Kob|Uganda kob]] (a [[grazing antelope]]) and the marine iguana, males defend the lek site which is used only for mating.

==Polyterritoriality==
Many species demonstrate polyterritoriality, referring to the act of claiming or defending more than one territory. In the [[European pied flycatcher]] (''Ficedula hypoleuca''), researchers assert that males exhibit polyterritoriality to deceive females of the species into entering into polygynous relationships. This hypothesis, named the [[Deception in animals|deception]] hypothesis, claims that males have territories at distances sufficiently great that females are unable to discern already-mated males. The observation that males travelled long distances, ranging from 200m to 3.5&amp;nbsp;km, to find a second mate supports this argument.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Alatalo | first= Rauno V. |author2=Carlson, Allan |author3=Lundberg, Arne |author4=Ulfstrand, Staffan | year= 1981| title= The Conflict Between Male Polygamy and Female Monogamy: The Case of the Pied Flycatcher ''Ficedula hypoleuca'' | journal= The American Naturalist | volume= 117 | issue = 5 | pages= 738–753 | doi =10.1086/283756 | s2cid= 85184225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about polyterritoriality in this species may initiate research about the evolution and reasons for polyterritoriality in other unrelated species.

      <text bytes="3812" xml:space="preserve">In [[astronomy]], a '''thalassogen''' denotes a substance capable of forming a planetary [[ocean]].&lt;ref name="Freitas"&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization, First Edition, Xenology Research Institute, Sacramento, CA, 1979; http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thalassogens are not necessarily life sustaining, although most interest has been in the context of [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council. The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems. National Academies Press (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Isaac Asimov]] in his essay "The Thalassogens", later published in his 1972 collection ''[[The Left Hand of the Electron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Asimov, The Thalassogens, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, December 1970, ed. Edward L. Ferman, publ. Mercury Press, Inc., $0.60,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Asimov, The Left Hand of the Electron, Doubleday, 0-385-04345-7, 225pp, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements making up thalassogens have to be relatively abundant, the substance must be chemically stable in its environment, and must remain liquid under the conditions found on some planets. Freitas gives the following table,&lt;ref name="Freitas"/&gt; noting that the liquid range typically increases with increasing pressure:

The critical temperature and pressure represents the point where the distinction between gas and liquid vanishes, a possible upper limit for life (though life in [[supercritical fluid]]s has been discussed both in science&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; and fiction, such as in ''[[Close to Critical]]'' by [[Hal Clement]]).

Later authors have also suggested [[sulfuric acid]], [[ethane]], and water/ammonia mixtures as possible thalassogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bains |first=William |title=Many chemistries could be used to build living systems |journal=Astrobiology |date=June 2004 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=137–67 |doi=10.1089/153110704323175124 |pmid=15253836|bibcode=2004AsBio...4..137B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of possible subsurface oceans on moons such as [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] also extends the range of possible environments.

== Background ==
By the 1960s, anthropologists such as [[Frank B. Livingstone]] had concluded that "there are no races, there are only clines" – smooth gradients of genetic variation in a species across its [[Marginal distribution (biology)|geographic range]]. Lewontin's mentor [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] challenged this, arguing that there are human discrete [[population]]s that can be distinguished by differences in the frequency of genetic traits, which he called races.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Jonathan Michael |last2=Winther |first2=Rasmus Grønfeldt |title=Realism, Antirealism, and Conventionalism about Race |journal=Philosophy of Science |date=December 2014 |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=1039–1052 |doi=10.1086/678314 |s2cid=55148854 |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/678314 |issn=0031-8248}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the debate was largely semantic, stemming from their different ideas about what race is and how it would be manifested in humans genetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Jonathan Michael |last2=Winther |first2=Rasmus Grønfeldt |date=2013 |title=Prisoners of Abstraction?

{{Blockquote|
And so I thought, 'Well, we've got enough of this data, let's see what it tells us about the differences between human groups'. And so I just looked into the literature, and that literature was in books and so on. [...] One day I was going to give a lecture, I think it was in Carbondale, Illinois, or somewhere south. I was working in Chicago at the time. So I took a couple of these books with me and a pad of paper, and a table of logarithms which I needed for this purpose, and a little hand calculator, and I sat on this bus trip for three or four hours looking at the books, picking out the data, looking it up in the table of logarithms, doing a calculation, and writing it down in tables. And when I got back after the round trip I had all the data I needed to write the paper about how much human genetic variation there was, and so I did it.

Lewontin had been interested in using [[Quantitative biology|quantitative methods]] to assess taxonomic categories for some time before 1972. Over a decade earlier, palaeontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] had invited him to co-author a second edition of his textbook ''Quantitative Zoology'' (1960), and Lewontin added a chapter on the [[analysis of variance]]. In it, he illustrated how this approach could be used distinguish geographically distinct races with the example of ''[[Drosophila persimilis]]'', a species of fruit fly. Though the method was similar to that he would later apply to human genetic variation, he reached the opposite conclusion: there was much greater genetic variance between geographic populations than between individual fruit flies, so there was a reasonable basis for distinguishing taxonomic races.&lt;ref name="Novembre2022"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Novembre |first=John |date=2022-06-06 |title=The background and legacy of Lewontin's apportionment of human genetic diversity |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=377 |issue=1852 |pages=20200406 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2020.0406|pmid=35430890 |pmc=9014184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreshadowing his later work on human genetic variation, he also emphasised that, because there will always be measurable differences between any two populations, it is the degree of difference compared to other axes of variation that will determine whether a grouping is biologically significant.&lt;ref name="Novembre2022" /&gt; "The Apportionment of Human Diversity" was published in an volume dedicated to Simpson, perhaps prompting Lewontin to recall this previous work.&lt;ref name="Novembre2022" /&gt;

== Findings ==
Lewontin performed a statistical analysis of the [[fixation index]] (''F''&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) in populations drawn from seven classically-defined "races" (Caucasian, African, Mongoloid, South Asian Aborigines, Amerinds, Oceanians, and Australian Aborigines). At that time, direct sequence data from the human [[genome]] was not sufficiently available, so he instead used 17 indirect markers, including blood group proteins. Lewontin found that the majority of the total genetic variation between humans (i.e., of the 0.1% of DNA that varies between individuals), 85.4%, is found within populations, 8.3% of the variation is found between populations within a "race", and only 6.3% was found to account for the racial classification. Numerous later studies have confirmed his findings.&lt;ref name="Ramachandran"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Vogel and Motulsky's Human Genetics: Problems and Approaches |editor1-last = Speicher |editor1-first = M.

Fifty years after its publication, the paper was found to be frequently referenced in [[social media]].&lt;ref name="CarlsonHarris2022"/&gt; In particular, [[Twitter]] users associated with [[far-right politics]] commonly used the term "Lewontin's fallacy" (referencing [[A. W. F. Edwards]]' 2003 critique of Lewontin, "[[Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy]]") as a rhetorical device to dismiss scientific arguments against biological race.&lt;ref name="CarlsonHarris2022"/&gt; Commenting on the enduring significance afforded to Lewontin's paper in far-right and [[white nationalist]] discourse, geneticists Jedidiah Carlson and Kelley Harris proposed that "rejection of Lewontin's interpretation has become a tenet of white nationalist ideology".&lt;ref name="CarlsonHarris2022"/&gt;

[[File:Giant Pufferfish skin pattern detail.jpg|thumb|Turing's paper explained how natural patterns, such as stripes, spots, and spirals, like those of the [[giant pufferfish]], may arise.]]

"'''The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis'''" is an article that the English mathematician [[Alan Turing]] wrote in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Turing | first1 = Alan | author-link = Alan Turing| title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 237 | issue = 641 | pages = 37–72 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | url = http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf| jstor = 92463| date = 1952 | bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T| s2cid = 120437796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes how [[patterns in nature]], such as stripes and spirals, can arise naturally from a homogeneous, uniform state. The theory, which can be called a [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion]] theory of [[morphogenesis]], has become a basic model in [[theoretical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, L.G. (1993). ''Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern''. [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Such patterns have come to be known as [[Turing pattern]]s. For example, it has been postulated that the protein [[Vascular endothelial growth factor C|VEGFC]] can form Turing patterns to govern [[lymphangiogenesis|the formation of lymphatic vessels]] in the [[zebrafish]] embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wertheim |first1=Kenneth |title=Can VEGFC form turing patterns in the Zebrafish embryo? |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |year=2019 |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=1201–1237 |doi=10.1007/s11538-018-00560-2 |pmid=30607882 |pmc=6397306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction–diffusion systems==
{{main|Reaction–diffusion system}}

[[Reaction–diffusion system]]s have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. Patterns such as fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and [[dissipative soliton]]s are found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. Such patterns have been dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Wooley, T. E., [[Ruth Baker|Baker, R. E.]], [[Philip Maini|Maini, P. K.]], Chapter 34, ''Turing's theory of morphogenesis''.

'''''The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA''''' is an autobiographical account of the discovery of the [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] written by [[James D. Watson]] and published in 1968. It has earned both critical and public praise, along with continuing controversy about credit for the Nobel award and attitudes towards female scientists at the time of the discovery.

==Significance==
Watson is a U.S. molecular biologist,&amp;nbsp;geneticist&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of&amp;nbsp;DNA&amp;nbsp;in 1953 with&amp;nbsp;[[Francis Crick]].

In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] placed ''The Double Helix'' at number 7 on its list of [[Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction|the 100 best nonfiction books of the 20th century]]. In 2012, ''The Double Helix'' was named as one of the 88 "Books That Shaped America" by the Library of Congress.

Though an important book about an immensely important subject, it was and remains a controversial account. Though it was originally slated to be published by [[Harvard University Press]], Watson's home university, Harvard dropped the arrangement after protestations from [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]],&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt; co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and it was published instead by [[Atheneum Press|Atheneum]] in the United States and [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] in the UK.

The intimate first-person memoir about scientific discovery was unusual for its time. The book has been hailed for its highly personal view of scientific work, though has been criticised as caring only about the glory of priority and the author is claimed to be willing to appropriate data from others surreptitiously in order to obtain it. It has also been criticized as being disagreeably sexist towards [[Rosalind Franklin]], another participant in the discovery, who was deceased by the time Watson's book was written.

The events described in the book were dramatized in a BBC television program ''[[Life Story (TV film)|Life Story]]'' (known as ''The Race for the Double Helix'' in the U.S.).

}}
A 1980 [[Norton Critical Edition]] of ''The Double Helix'' edited by [[Gunther Stent]], analyzed the events surrounding its initial publication. It presents a selection of both positive and negative reviews of the book, by such figures as [[Philip Morrison]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Jacob Bronowski]], and more in-depth analyses by [[Peter Medawar]], [[Robert K. Merton]], and [[Andre Lwoff]]. [[Erwin Chargaff]] declined permission to reprint his unsympathetic review from the March 29, 1968, issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', but letters in response from [[Max Perutz]], Maurice Wilkins, and Watson are printed.  Also included are retrospectives from a 1974 edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' written by Francis Crick and [[Linus Pauling]], and an analysis of Franklin's work by her student [[Aaron Klug]]. The Norton edition concludes with the 1953 papers on DNA structure as published in ''Nature''.

In the book ''[[Rosalind Franklin and DNA]]'', author [[Anne Sayre]] is very critical of Watson's account. She claims that Watson's book did not give a balanced description of [[Rosalind Franklin]] and the nature of her interactions with Maurice Wilkins at King's College, London. Sayre's book raises doubts about the ethics of how Watson and Crick used some of Franklin's results and whether adequate credit was given to her. Watson had very limited contact with Franklin during the time she worked on DNA. By providing more information about Franklin's life than was included in Watson's book, it was possible for Sayre to provide a different perspective on the role Franklin played in Watson and Crick's discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. (See: [[King's College (London) DNA Controversy]])

In the book's preface, Watson explains that he is describing his impressions at the time of the events, and not at the time he wrote the book. In the epilogue Watson writes; "Since my initial impressions about [Franklin], both scientific and personal (as recorded in the early pages of this book) were often wrong I want to say something here about her achievements." He goes on to describe her superb work, and, despite this, the enormous barriers she faced as a woman in the field of science. He also acknowledged that it took years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate Franklin's generosity and integrity.

== An annotated and illustrated edition ==

An annotated and illustrated version of the book, edited by Alex Gann and Jan Witkowski, was published in November 2012 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in association with [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press]]. The new edition coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the 1962 [[Nobel Prize]] for physiology or medicine to [[Francis Crick]], [[James D. Watson]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]]. It contains over three hundred annotations on the events and characters portrayed, with facsimile letters and contemporary photographs, many previously unpublished. Their sources include newly discovered correspondence from Crick, the papers of Franklin, Pauling, and Wilkins, and they include a chapter dropped from the original edition that described Watson's holiday in the Italian Alps in 1952. The edition was favorably reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by [[Nicholas Wade]] who commented, "anyone seeking to understand modern biology and genomics could do much worse than start with the discovery of the structure of DNA, on which almost everything else is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/science/the-double-helix-review-twists-in-the-tale-of-the-great-dna-discovery.html|title=Twists in the Tale of the Great DNA Discovery|date=2012-11-12|access-date=2020-10-08|website=[[The New York Times]]|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition includes several appendices, including letters by Crick and Watson giving the first account of the discovery, a previously unpublished chapter, an account of the controversy surrounding the publication, and the unsympathetic review by the late [[Erwin Chargaff]] from the March 29, 1968, issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', which he previously declined permission to reprint in the 1980 [[Norton Critical Edition]] of ''The Double Helix'' edited by [[Gunther Stent]].

The book does not include the four press cuttings from the ''[[News Chronicle]], [[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' (2) of May and June 1953 regarding the discovery of the structure of DNA, and [https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/101584582X137 Crick's letter of 13th April 1967] is incomplete.

==Film adaptation==
In 1987, the memoir was adapted as a 107-minute television docudrama called ''[[Life Story (film)|Life Story]]'' for the BBC, airing on ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'', the long-running British documentary television series on [[BBC Two]] that covers science and philosophy. The script was written by [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]], and it was produced and directed by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]]. [[Jeff Goldblum]] starred as Watson, with [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as [[Francis Crick]], [[Juliet Stevenson]] as [[Rosalind Franklin]], and [[Alan Howard (actor)|Alan Howard]] as [[Maurice Wilkins]].

The film won several awards in the UK and U.S., including the 1988 [[BAFTA]] TV Award as the Best Single Drama.

'''''The Growth of Biological Thought''''' (992 pages, [[Belknap Press]], {{ISBN|0674364465}}) is a book written by [[Ernst Mayr]], first published in [[1982 in literature|1982]].  It is subtitled '''Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance''', and is as much a book of [[philosophy]] and [[history]] as it is of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674364462|title=The Growth of Biological Thought — Ernst Mayr|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a sweeping, academic study of the first 2,400 years of the [[science]] of [[biology]].  It focuses largely on how the philosophical assumptions of biologists influenced and limited their understanding.  It includes many important general observations about the role of philosophy in scientific inquiry and the place of biology amongst the sciences.

Koshland]] in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/biology/2002-03-29-life-pillars.htm |title=Usatoday.Com |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2002-07-22 |accessdate=2022-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying [[artificial life|artificial]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.

== The Seven Pillars ==

=== Program ===
Koshland defines "Program" as an "organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt; In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of [[nucleic acids]] and [[amino acids]], but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.

=== Improvisation ===
"Improvisation" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is [[natural selection]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
"Compartmentalization" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.

=== Energy ===
Because living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through [[entropy]], [[energy]] is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in [[chemosynthesis]].

=== Regeneration ===
"Regeneration" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in [[ageing]]. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.

=== Adaptability ===
"Adaptability" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through [[feedback]] and [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.

=== Seclusion ===
"Seclusion" is the separation of chemical pathways and the specificity of the effect of molecules, so that processes can function separately within the living system. In organisms on Earth, [[proteins]] aid in seclusion because of their individualized structure that are specific for their function, so that they can efficiently act without affecting separate functions.

== Criticism ==
Y. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of [[primordial life]] and, though calling the concept "elegant," point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuravlev, Y. N. and V. A. Avetisov."The definition of life in the context of its origin"''[[Biogeosciences]]'', 2006-07-10. Retrieved on 2008-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="13216" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Analysis of material by examining how it responds to heat}}
'''Thermal analysis''' is a branch of [[materials science]] where the properties of materials are studied as they change with  [[temperature]]. Several methods are commonly used – these are distinguished from one another by the property which is measured:

* [[Dielectric thermal analysis]]: dielectric permittivity and loss factor 
* [[Differential thermal analysis]]: temperature difference versus temperature or time
* [[Differential scanning calorimetry]]: heat flow changes versus temperature or time
* [[Dilatometer|Dilatometry]]: volume changes with temperature change
* [[Dynamic mechanical analysis]]: measures storage modulus (stiffness) and loss modulus (damping) versus temperature, time and frequency 
* [[Evolved gas analysis]]: analysis of gases evolved during heating of a material, usually decomposition products
* [[Isothermal titration calorimetry]]
* [[Isothermal microcalorimetry]]
* [[Laser flash analysis]]: thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity
* [[Thermogravimetric analysis]]: mass change versus temperature or time
* [[Thermomechanical analysis]]: dimensional changes versus temperature or time
* [[Thermo-optical analysis]]: optical properties
* [[Derivatography]]: A complex method in thermal analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18960022 | volume=13 | issue=10 | title=Derivatography: A complex method in thermal analysis | year=1966 | journal=Talanta | pages=1405–30 | last1 = Paulik | first1 = F | last2 = Paulik | first2 = J | last3 = Erdey | first3 = L | doi=10.1016/0039-9140(66)80083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Simultaneous thermal analysis generally refers to the simultaneous application of [[thermogravimetry]] and [[differential scanning calorimetry]] to one and the same sample in a single instrument. The test conditions are perfectly identical for the thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry signals (same atmosphere, gas flow rate, vapor pressure of the sample, heating rate, thermal contact to the sample crucible and sensor, radiation effect, etc.). The information gathered can even be enhanced by coupling the simultaneous thermal analysis instrument to an Evolved Gas Analyzer like [[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] or [[mass spectrometry]].

Other, less common, methods measure the sound or light emission from a sample, or the electrical discharge from a dielectric material, or the mechanical relaxation in a stressed specimen. The essence of all these techniques is that the sample's response is recorded as a function of temperature (and time).

It is usual to control the temperature in a predetermined way – either by a continuous increase or decrease in temperature at a constant rate (linear heating/cooling) or by carrying out a series of determinations at different temperatures (stepwise isothermal measurements). More advanced temperature profiles have been developed which use an oscillating (usually sine or square wave) heating rate (Modulated Temperature Thermal Analysis) or modify the heating rate in response to changes in the system's properties (Sample Controlled Thermal Analysis).

In addition to controlling the temperature of the sample, it is also important to control its environment (e.g. atmosphere). Measurements may be carried out in air or under an inert gas (e.g. nitrogen or helium). Reducing or reactive atmospheres have also been used and measurements are even carried out with the sample surrounded by water or other liquids. [[Inverse gas chromatography]] is a technique which studies the interaction of gases and vapours with a surface - measurements are often made at different temperatures so that these experiments can be considered to come under the auspices of Thermal Analysis.

[[Atomic force microscope|Atomic force microscopy]] uses a fine stylus to map the topography and mechanical properties of surfaces to high spatial resolution. By controlling the temperature of the heated tip and/or the sample a form of spatially resolved thermal analysis can be carried out.

''Thermal analysis'' is also often used as a term for the study of [[heat transfer]] through structures. Many of the basic engineering data for modelling such systems comes from measurements of [[Specific heat capacity|heat capacity]] and [[thermal conductivity]].

==Polymers==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
Polymers represent another large area in which thermal analysis finds strong applications. Thermoplastic polymers are commonly found in everyday [[packaging]] and household items, but for the analysis of the raw materials, effects of the many additive used (including stabilisers and colours) and fine-tuning of the moulding or extrusion processing used  can be achieved by using differential scanning calorimetry. An example is oxidation induction time by differential scanning calorimetry which can determine the amount of oxidation stabiliser present in a thermoplastic (usually a polyolefin) polymer material. Compositional analysis is often made using thermogravimetric analysis, which can separate fillers, polymer resin and other additives. Thermogravimetric analysis can also give an indication of thermal stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants

Thermal analysis of composite materials, such as carbon fibre composites or glass epoxy composites are often carried out using dynamic mechanical analysis, which can measure the stiffness of materials by determining the modulus and damping (energy absorbing) properties of the material. Aerospace companies often employ these analysers in routine quality control to ensure that products being manufactured meet the required strength specifications. Formula 1 racing car manufacturers also have similar requirements. Differential scanning calorimetry is used to determine the curing properties of the resins used in composite materials, and can also confirm whether a resin can be cured and how much heat is evolved during that process. Application of predictive kinetics analysis can help to fine-tune manufacturing processes. Another example is that thermogravimetric analysis can be used to measure the fibre content of composites by heating a sample to remove the resin by application of heat and then determining the mass remaining.

==Metals==
Production of many metals ([[cast iron]], [[grey iron]], [[ductile iron]], [[compacted graphite iron]], [[aluminium alloy#Wrought alloys|3000 series aluminium alloys]], [[copper alloys]], [[silver]], and complex [[steel]]s) are aided by a production technique also referred to as thermal analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emadi|first=D|author2=L. V. Whiting |author3=S. Nafisi |author4=R. Ghomashchi |journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry|year=2005|volume=81|issue=1|pages=235–242|doi=10.1007/s10973-005-0772-9|title=Applications of thermal analysis in quality control of solidification processes|s2cid=96442065}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of liquid metal is removed from the furnace or ladle and poured into a sample cup with a thermocouple embedded in it. The temperature is then monitored, and the phase diagram arrests ([[liquidus]], [[eutectic]], and [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]]) are noted. From this information chemical composition based on the phase diagram can be calculated, or the crystalline structure of the cast sample can be estimated especially for silicon morphology in hypo-eutectic Al-Si cast alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farahany|first=Saeed|author2=Ali Ourdjini |author3=Mohd Hasbullah Idris |title=The usage of computer-aided cooling curve thermal analysis to optimise eutectic refiner and modifier in Al–Si alloys|journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry|year=2012|volume=109|issue=1|pages=105–111|doi=10.1007/s10973-011-1708-1|s2cid=138476636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strictly speaking these measurements are ''cooling curves'' and a form of sample controlled thermal analysis whereby the cooling rate of the sample is dependent on the cup material (usually bonded sand) and sample volume which is normally a constant due to the use of standard sized sample cups. To detect phase evolution and corresponding characteristic temperatures, cooling curve and its first derivative curve should be considered simultaneously. Examination of cooling and derivative curves is done by using appropriate data analysis software.  The process consists of plotting, smoothing and curve fitting as well as identifying the reaction points and characteristic parameters. This procedure is known as Computer-Aided Cooling Curve Thermal Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10973-013-3005-7 | volume=114 | issue = 2 | title=Computer-aided cooling curve thermal analysis of near eutectic Al–Si–Cu–Fe alloy | journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry | pages=705–717| date = November 2013 | last1 = Shabestari | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Idris | first2 = M. H. | last3 = Ourdjini | first3 = A. | last4 = Farahany | first4 = S. | s2cid=94656052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced techniques use differential curves to locate endothermic inflection points such as gas holes, and shrinkage, or exothermic phases such as carbides, beta crystals, inter crystalline copper, magnesium silicide, iron phosphide's and other phases as they solidify. Detection limits seem to be around 0.01% to 0.03% of volume.

In addition, integration of the area between the zero curve and the first derivative is a measure of the specific heat of that part of the solidification which can lead to rough estimates of the percent volume of a phase. (Something has to be either known or assumed about the specific heat of the phase versus the overall specific heat.) In spite of this limitation, this method is better than estimates from two dimensional micro analysis, and a lot faster than chemical dissolution.

==Foods==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
Most foods are subjected to variations in their temperature during production, transport, storage, preparation and consumption, e.g., [[pasteurization]], [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], [[evaporation]], [[cooking]], [[freezing]], chilling, etc. Temperature changes cause alterations in the physical and chemical properties of food components which influence the overall properties of the final product, e.g., taste, appearance, texture and stability. Chemical reactions such as [[hydrolysis]], [[oxidation]] or [[redox|reduction]] may be promoted, or physical changes, such as evaporation, [[melting]], [[crystallization]], aggregation or gelation may occur. A better understanding of the influence of temperature on the properties of foods enables food manufacturers to optimize processing conditions and improve product quality. It is therefore important for food scientists to have analytical techniques to monitor the changes that occur in foods when their temperature varies. These techniques are often grouped under the general heading of thermal analysis. In principle, most analytical techniques can be used, or easily adapted, to monitor the temperature-dependent properties of foods, e.g., spectroscopic ([[nuclear magnetic resonance]], [[UV]]-visible, [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[fluorescence]]), scattering ([[light]], [[X-ray]]s, [[neutron]]s), physical (mass, density, [[rheology]], [[heat capacity]]) etc. Nevertheless, at present the term thermal analysis is usually reserved for a narrow range of techniques that measure changes in the physical properties of foods with temperature (TG/DTG,{{clarify|What does this abbreviation mean?|date=August 2019}} differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and transition temperature).

==Printed circuit boards==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
Power dissipation is an important issue in present-day PCB{{clarify|What does this abbreviation mean?|date=August 2019}} design. Power dissipation will result in temperature difference and pose a thermal problem to a chip. In addition to the issue of reliability, excess heat will also negatively affect electrical performance and safety. The working temperature of an IC should therefore be kept below the maximum allowable limit of the worst case. In general, the temperatures of junction and ambient are 125&amp;nbsp;°C and 55&amp;nbsp;°C, respectively.
The ever-shrinking chip size causes the heat to concentrate within a small area and leads to high power density. Furthermore, denser transistors gathering in a monolithic chip and higher operating frequency cause a worsening of the power dissipation. Removing the heat effectively becomes the critical issue to be resolved.

      <text bytes="3314" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Sensory illusion}}
The '''thermal grill illusion''' is a sensory [[illusion]] originally demonstrated in 1896 by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[physician]] [[Torsten Thunberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thunberg T|title=Förnimmelserne vid till samma ställe lokaliserad, samtidigt pågående köld-och värmeretning|journal=Uppsala Läkfören Förh|year=1896|issue=1|pages=489–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thunberg |first1=Torsten |title=Co-localized sensations resulting from simultaneous cold and warm stimulation (English Translation) |year=2016 |doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.2392.4728 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305700685}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illusion is created by an interlaced [[Barbecue grill|grill]] of warm (e.g., 40°C/104°F) and cool (20°C/68°F) bars. When someone presses a hand against the grill, they experience the illusion of burning heat. But if the person presses against only a cool bar, only coolness is experienced; if the person presses against only a warm bar, only warmth is experienced.

Researchers have used the illusion to demonstrate that burning [[pain]] sensation is in fact a mixture of both cold and heat pain and that it is only the inhibition of the cold pain "channel" that reveals the heat component.

The illusion is demonstrated by positioning the middle finger in cold water and the ring and index fingers in warm water. Due to shortcomings in the body map - multisensory representation of the body - and this particular sensory input configuration, for some people the brain is tricked into thinking the middle finger is in the warm water and the index and ring fingers in cold water.

In an [[fMRI]] experiment of the illusion, researchers recently observed an activation of the [[thalamus]] not seen for [[Control experiment|control]] stimuli. Also, activity in a portion of the right mid/anterior [[Insular cortex|insula]] correlated with the perceived unpleasantness of the illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ingvar|first1=Martin|last2=Fransson|first2=Peter|last3=Kosek|first3=Eva|last4=Martinsen|first4=Sofia|last5=Johansson|first5=Bo|last6=Lindstedt|first6=Fredrik|date=2011-11-11|title=Evidence for Thalamic Involvement in the Thermal Grill Illusion: An fMRI Study|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=11|pages=e27075|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0027075|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3214046|pmid=22096519|bibcode=2011PLoSO...627075L|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thermoreg}}
'''Thermolabile''' refers to a substance which is subject to destruction, [[chemical decomposition|decomposition]], or change in response to [[heat]]. This term is often used to describe [[biochemical]] substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~cwallis/482/visualsystem/lexicon.html|title=Thermolabile|website=web.csulb.edu|access-date=2018-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many bacterial [[exotoxin]]s are thermolabile and can be easily inactivated by the application of moderate heat. 
[[Enzyme]]s are also thermolabile and lose their activity when the temperature rises.
Loss of activity in such toxins and enzymes is likely due to change in the three-dimensional structure of the toxin [[protein]] during exposure to heat.
In [[pharmaceutical]] compounds, heat generated during grinding may lead to degradation of thermolabile compounds.

This is of particular use in testing [[gene]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=G|last2=Chen|first2=M|last3=Foote|first3=C|last4=Tan|first4=C|title=Temperature-sensitive mutations made easy: generating conditional mutations by using temperature-sensitive inteins that function within different temperature ranges.|journal=Genetics|date=September 2009|volume=183|issue=1|pages=13–22|pmid=19596904|doi=10.1534/genetics.109.104794|pmc=2746138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by intentionally creating [[mutant]]s which are thermolabile. Growth below the [[permissive temperature]] allows normal protein function, while increasing the temperature above the permissive temperature ablates activity, likely by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] the protein.

Thermolabile [[enzymes]] are also studied for their applications in [[DNA replication]] techniques, such as [[PCR]], where [[thermostable]] enzymes are necessary for proper DNA replication. Enzyme function at higher temperatures may be enhanced with [[trehalose]], which opens up the possibility of using normally thermolabile enzymes in DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermostabilization and thermoactivation of thermolabile enzymes by trehalose and its application for the synthesis of full length cDNA|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=95|pages=520–524|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.2.520|date=January 1998|first1=PIERO |last1=CARNINCI|issue=2|display-authors=etal|pmc=18452|pmid=9435224|bibcode=1998PNAS...95..520C|s2cid=43521603|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6067" xml:space="preserve">[[File:A032, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, hot springs, 2001.jpg|thumb|Hot-springs with [[bacteria]], [[cyanobacteria]],  and [[algae]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]
'''Thermophyte''' ([[ancient Greek|Greek]] ''thérmos'' = warmth, heat + ''phyton'' = plant)  is an [[organism]] which is tolerant or thriving  at high temperatures. These organisms are categorized according to [[ecological valence]]s at high temperatures, including biological extremely. Such organisms included the hot-spring [[taxon|taxa]] also.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite book|editor= Lawrence E.|year=1999|title=Henderson's Dictionary of biological terms|publisher=Longman Group Ltd.|place= London|isbn=  0-582-22708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Međedović"&gt;{{cite book|author=Međedović S., Maslić E., Hadžiselimović R.|year=2002|title=Biologija 2. |publisher=Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large amount of thermophytes are algae, more specifically blue-green algae, also referred to as cyanobacteria. This type of algae thrives in hot conditions ranging anywhere from 50 to 70 degrees Celsius,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-09-16|title=Algae: Definition, Occurrence and Affinities|url=https://www.biologydiscussion.com/algae/algae-definition-occurrence-and-affinities/53530|access-date=2021-12-10|website=Biology Discussion|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Algae|url=http://www.vpscience.org/materials/Algae.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which other plants and organisms cannot survive in. Thermophytes are able to survive extreme temperatures as their cells contain an “unorganized nucleus”.

As the name suggests, thermophytes are found in high temperatures. They can be found in abundance in and around places like freshwater hot springs, such as YellowStone National park and in the Lassen Volcanic National park.

== Mutualism in Thermophytes ==
[[File:Yellow Stone Hot Spring.jpg|thumb|Image of Yellowstone National Park hot spring surrounded by thermophytic plants taken in July 2021.]]
There are instances in which a fungus and plant become thermophytes by forming a symbiotic relationship with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Semenkov|first=I. N.|last2=Klink|first2=G.

Mutualists like the panic grass and its fungal partner cannot survive individually, but thrive when they are in the symbiotic relationship. This means the fungus, plant, and virus function together to survive in such extreme conditions by benefiting from each other. The fungi typically dwells in the intracellular spaces between the plant's cells.

In a study performed at Washington State, it was discovered that panic grass living near the hot springs in Yellowstone National park thrive due to their relationship with the fungus Curvularia protuberata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Can a Fungus Save Plants from Global Warming|url=https://www.biointeractive.org/sites/default/files/media/file/2019-08/savedbyfungus-transcript-animatedshort.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Yellowstone plant reveals secret for tolerating high temperatures|url=http://www.montana.edu/news/629/yellowstone-plant-reveals-secret-for-tolerating-high-temperatures|access-date=2021-12-10|website=Montana State University|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither organism can survive on their own at such high temperatures. The mycoviruses infect the fungi that live within these plants and algae. These mycoviruses prevent the fungi from having a pathogenic effect on the plants, thus preventing the fungus from harming the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Susan|date=March 2007|title=Three pieces in the puzzle|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro1627|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=169–169|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1627|issn=1740-1534}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengyella|first=Louis|last2=Iftikhar|first2=Sehrish|last3=Nawaz|first3=Kiran|last4=Fonmboh|first4=Dobgima J.|last5=Yekwa|first5=Elsie L.|last6=Jones|first6=Robinson C.|last7=Njanu|first7=Yiboh M.

The study at Washington State has led to the discovery of a way to use these relationships between fungi and plants to make crops more thermo-tolerant, allowing them to resist damage by heat.

The most famous of these ecological groups of organisms are:
*[[Deinococcota]], including ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', a species of [[bacteria]].
*''[[Cyanobacteria]]'',  blue-green algae.
*[[Oscillatoria]] terebriformis
*[[Oscillatoria brevis]] 
*Heterohormogonium (motile cell filaments formed by [[cyanobacteria]])
*[[Synechococcus elongatus]]
*[[Scytonema]]
*[[Panicum|Panic grass]] (panic grass with a fungal association with [[Curvularia]])

[[Heat shock response|Heat Stress Response]] in Plants

The various heat stress response pathways enhance thermotolerance. The heat stress response in plants is mediated by heat shock transcription factors ([[Heat shock factor|HSF]]) and is well conserved across eukaryotes. HSFs are essential in plants’ ability to both sense and respond to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Hsiang-chin |last2=Charng |first2=Yee-yung |date=2012-05-01 |title=Acquired thermotolerance independent of heat shock factor A1 (HsfA1), the master regulator of the heat stress response |url=https://doi.org/10.4161/psb.19803 |journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=547–550 |doi=10.4161/psb.19803 |pmc=3419016 |pmid=22516818}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HSFs, which are divided into three families (A, B, and C), encode the expression of heat shock proteins ([[Heat shock protein|HSP]]). Past studies have found that transcriptional activators HsfA1 and HsfB1 are the main positive regulators of heat stress response genes in [[Arabidopsis thaliana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Yoshida |first1=Takumi |last2=Ohama |first2=Naohiko |last3=Nakajima |first3=Jun |last4=Kidokoro |first4=Satoshi |last5=Mizoi |first5=Junya |last6=Nakashima |first6=Kazuo |last7=Maruyama |first7=Kyonoshin |last8=Kim |first8=Jong-Myong |last9=Seki |first9=Motoaki |last10=Todaka |first10=Daisuke |last11=Osakabe |first11=Yuriko |date=2011-12-01 |title=Arabidopsis HsfA1 transcription factors function as the main positive regulators in heat shock-responsive gene expression |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00438-011-0647-7 |journal=Molecular Genetics and Genomics |language=en |volume=286 |issue=5 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1007/s00438-011-0647-7 |pmid=21931939 |s2cid=8284912 |issn=1617-4623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general pathway to thermotolerance is characterized by sensing of heat stress, activation of HSFs, upregulation of heat response, and return to the non-stressed state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bäurle |first=Isabel |date=2016 |title=Plant Heat Adaptation: priming in response to heat stress |journal=F1000Research |volume=5 |pages=F1000 Faculty Rev–694 |doi=10.12688/f1000research.7526.1 |issn=2046-1402 |pmc=4837978 |pmid=27134736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, while studying heat stress ''A. thaliana'', Ikeda et al. concluded that the early response is regulated by HsfA1 and the extended response is regulated by HsfA2. They used RT-PCR to analyze the expression of HS-inducible genes of mutant (ectopic and nonfunctional HsfB1) and wild type plants. Plants with mutant HsfB1 had lower acquired thermotolerance, based on both lower expression of heat stress genes and visibly altered phenotypes. With these results they concluded that class A HSFs positively regulated the heat stress response while class B HSFs repressed the expression of HSF genes. Therefore, both were necessary for plants to return to non-stressed conditions and acquired thermotolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ikeda |first1=Miho |last2=Mitsuda |first2=Nobutaka |last3=Ohme-Takagi |first3=Masaru |date=2011-11-01 |title=Arabidopsis HsfB1 and HsfB2b Act as Repressors of the Expression of Heat-Inducible Hsfs But Positively Regulate the Acquired Thermotolerance |url=https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.179036 |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=157 |issue=3 |pages=1243–1254 |doi=10.1104/pp.111.179036 |issn=0032-0889 |pmc=3252156 |pmid=21908690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce substantially longer reads than [[Massive parallel sequencing|second generation sequencing]], also known as next-generation sequencing.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bleidorn|first=Christoph|date=2016-01-02|title=Third generation sequencing: technology and its potential impact on evolutionary biodiversity research|journal=Systematics and Biodiversity|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/14772000.2015.1099575|s2cid=85991118|issn=1477-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an advantage has critical implications for both genome science and the study of biology in general. However, third generation sequencing data have much higher error rates than previous technologies, which can complicate downstream genome assembly and analysis of the resulting data.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Pushpendra K.|date=2008-11-01|title=Single-molecule DNA sequencing technologies for future genomics research|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=26|issue=11|pages=602–611|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.07.003|pmid=18722683}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies are undergoing active development and it is expected that there will be improvements to the high error rates. For applications that are more tolerant to error rates, such as structural variant calling, third generation sequencing has been found to outperform existing methods, even at a low depth of sequencing coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tham|first=Cheng Yong|date=2020-03-03|title=NanoVar: accurate characterization of patients' genomic structural variants using low-depth nanopore sequencing|journal=Genome Biology|volume=21|issue=Article number: 56|page=56|language=en|doi=10.1186/s13059-020-01968-7|pmc=7055087 |pmid=32127024|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current technologies ==

Sequencing technologies with a different approach than second-generation platforms were first described as "third-generation" in 2008–2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Check Hayden|first=Erika|date=2009-02-06|title=Genome sequencing: the third generation|journal=Nature News|volume=457|issue=7231|pages=768–769|language=en|doi=10.1038/news.2009.86|pmid=19212365|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several companies currently at the heart of third generation sequencing technology development, namely, [[Pacific Biosciences]], [[Oxford Nanopore Technologies|Oxford Nanopore Technology]], Quantapore (CA-USA), and Stratos (WA-USA). These companies are taking fundamentally different approaches to sequencing single DNA molecules.

PacBio developed the sequencing platform of [[SMRT sequencing|single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT)]], based on the properties of [[zero-mode waveguide]]s. Signals are in the form of fluorescent light emission from each nucleotide incorporated by a DNA polymerase bound to the bottom of the zL well.

[[Nanopore sequencing|Oxford Nanopore’s technology]] involves passing a DNA molecule through a nanoscale pore structure and then measuring changes in electrical field surrounding the pore; while Quantapore has a different proprietary nanopore approach. Stratos Genomics spaces out the DNA bases with polymeric inserts, "''Xpandomers''", to circumvent the signal to noise challenge of nanopore ssDNA reading.

Also notable is [[Helicos single molecule fluorescent sequencing|Helicos]]'s single molecule fluorescence approach, but the company entered bankruptcy in the [[Helicos Biosciences|fall of 2015]].

== Advantages ==

=== Longer reads ===
In comparison to the current generation of sequencing technologies, third generation sequencing has the obvious advantage of producing much longer reads. It is expected that these longer read lengths will alleviate numerous computational challenges surrounding genome assembly, transcript reconstruction, and metagenomics among other important areas of modern biology and medicine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It is well known that eukaryotic genomes including primates and humans are complex and have large numbers of long repeated regions. Short reads from second generation sequencing must resort to approximative strategies in order to infer sequences over long ranges for assembly and genetic variant calling. [[Paired-end tag|Pair end reads]] have been leveraged by second generation sequencing to combat these limitations. However, exact fragment lengths of pair ends are often unknown and must also be approximated as well. By making long reads lengths possible, third generation sequencing technologies have clear advantages.

=== Epigenetics ===
[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic markers]] are stable and potentially heritable modifications to the DNA molecule that are not in its sequence. An example is DNA methylation at CpG sites, which has been found to influence gene expression. Histone modifications are another example. The current generation of sequencing technologies rely on laboratory techniques such as [[ChIP-sequencing]] for the detection of epigenetic markers. These techniques involve tagging the DNA strand, breaking and filtering fragments that contain markers, followed by sequencing. Third generation sequencing may enable direct detection of these markers due to their distinctive signal from the other four nucleotide bases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Portability and speed ===
[[File:MinION Portable Gene Sequencer IMG 20200219 170422318.jpg|thumb|right|MinION Portable Gene Sequencer, Oxford Nanopore Technologies]]
Other important advantages of third generation sequencing technologies include portability and sequencing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schadt|first1=E.

Oxford Nanopore Technology has recently commercialized the [https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion MinION sequencer]. This sequencing machine is roughly the size of a regular USB flash drive and can be used readily by connecting to a laptop. In addition, since the sequencing process is not parallelized across regions of the genome, data could be collected and analyzed in real time. These advantages of third generation sequencing may be well-suited in hospital settings where quick and on-site data collection and analysis is demanded.

== Challenges ==
{{Update|section=yes|date=January 2020|part=long-read sequencing technologies producing low-accuracy reads. While true 5 years ago, circular consensus reads with the PacBio Sequel II long-read sequencer can easily achieve an even higher read accuracy than [[hybrid genome assembly]] with a combination of other sequencers.  [https://www.pacb.com/smrt-science/smrt-sequencing/smrt-sequencing-modes/] {{PMID|31885515|28364362|31406327|31897449|31483244}}}}

Third generation sequencing, as it currently stands, faces important challenges mainly surrounding accurate identification of nucleotide bases; error rates are still much higher compared to second generation sequencing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is generally due to instability of the molecular machinery involved. For example, in PacBio’s single molecular and real time sequencing technology, the DNA polymerase molecule becomes increasingly damaged as the sequencing process occurs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, since the process happens quickly, the signals given off by individual bases may be blurred by signals from neighbouring bases. This poses a new computational challenge for deciphering the signals and consequently inferring the sequence. Methods such as [[Hidden Markov model|Hidden Markov Models]], for example, have been leveraged for this purpose with some success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On average, different individuals of the human population share about 99.9% of their genes. In other words, approximately only one out of every thousand bases would differ between any two person. The high error rates involved with third generation sequencing are inevitably problematic for the purpose of characterizing individual differences that exist between members of the same species.

== Genome assembly ==
[[Sequence assembly|Genome assembly]] is the reconstruction of whole genome DNA sequences. This is generally done with two fundamentally different approaches.

=== Reference alignment ===
When a reference genome is available, as one is in the case of human, newly sequenced reads could simply be aligned to the reference genome in order to characterize its properties. Such reference based assembly is quick and easy but has the disadvantage of “hiding" novel sequences and large copy number variants. In addition, reference genomes do not yet exist for most organisms.

=== ''De novo'' assembly ===
''De novo'' assembly is the alternative genome assembly approach to reference alignment. It refers to the reconstruction of whole genome sequences entirely from raw sequence reads. This method would be chosen when there is no reference genome, when the species of the given organism is unknown as in [[metagenomics]], or when there exist genetic variants of interest that may not be detected by reference genome alignment.

Given the short reads produced by the current generation of sequencing technologies, de novo assembly is a major computational problem. It is normally approached by an iterative process of finding and connecting sequence reads with sensible overlaps. Various computational and statistical techniques, such as [[De Bruijn graph|de bruijn graphs]] and overlap layout consensus graphs, have been leveraged to solve this problem. Nonetheless, due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes, accurate and complete reconstruction of genome sequences in de novo assembly remains challenging. [[Paired-end tag|Pair end reads]] have been posed as a possible solution, though exact fragment lengths are often unknown and must be approximated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Ruiqiang|last2=Zhu|first2=Hongmei|last3=Ruan|first3=Jue|last4=Qian|first4=Wubin|last5=Fang|first5=Xiaodong|last6=Shi|first6=Zhongbin|last7=Li|first7=Yingrui|last8=Li|first8=Shengting|last9=Shan|first9=Gao|date=2010-02-01|title=De novo assembly of human genomes with massively parallel short read sequencing|journal=Genome Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=265–272|doi=10.1101/gr.097261.109|issn=1088-9051|pmc=2813482|pmid=20019144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HybridAssembly.png|thumb|480x480px|Hybrid assembly – the use of reads from 3rd gen sequencing platforms with shorts reads from 2nd gen platforms – may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. Short second generation reads have also been used to correct errors that exist in the long third generation reads.]]

=== Hybrid assembly ===
Long read lengths offered by third generation sequencing may alleviate many of the challenges currently faced by de novo genome assemblies. For example, if an entire repetitive region can be sequenced unambiguously in a single read, no computation inference would be required. Computational methods have been proposed to alleviate the issue of high error rates. For example, in one study, it was demonstrated that de novo assembly of a microbial genome using PacBio sequencing alone performed superior to that of second generation sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chin|first1=Chen-Shan|last2=Alexander|first2=David H.|last3=Marks|first3=Patrick|last4=Klammer|first4=Aaron A.|last5=Drake|first5=James|last6=Heiner|first6=Cheryl|last7=Clum|first7=Alicia|last8=Copeland|first8=Alex|last9=Huddleston|first9=John|date=2013-06-01|title=Nonhybrid, finished microbial genome assemblies from long-read SMRT sequencing data|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=563–569|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2474|pmid=23644548|s2cid=205421576|issn=1548-7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation sequencing may also be used in conjunction with second generation sequencing. This approach is often referred to as hybrid sequencing. For example, long reads from third generation sequencing may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. On the other hand, short second generation reads have been used to correct errors in that exist in the long third generation reads. In general, this hybrid approach has been shown to improve de novo genome assemblies significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Goodwin|first1=Sara|last2=Gurtowski|first2=James|last3=Ethe-Sayers|first3=Scott|last4=Deshpande|first4=Panchajanya|last5=Schatz|first5=Michael C.|last6=McCombie|first6=W.

== Epigenetic markers ==
[[DNA methylation]] (DNAm) – the covalent modification of [[DNA]] at CpG sites resulting in attached [[methyl group]]s – is the best understood component of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] machinery. DNA modifications and resulting gene expression can vary across cell types, temporal development, with genetic ancestry, can change due to environmental stimuli and are heritable. After the discovery of DNAm, researchers have also found its correlation to diseases like cancer and [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=Hunter B.|last2=Lam|first2=Lucia L.|last3=Neumann|first3=Sarah M.|last4=Kobor|first4=Michael S.|date=2012-02-09|title=Population-specificity of human DNA methylation|journal=Genome Biology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=R8|doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-2-r8|issn=1474-760X|pmc=3334571|pmid=22322129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this disease etiology context DNAm is an important avenue of further research.

=== Advantages ===
The current most common methods for examining methylation state [[DNA methylation#Detection|require an assay]] that fragments DNA before standard second generation sequencing on the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] platform. As a result of short read length, information regarding the longer patterns of methylation are lost.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite bioRxiv|last1=Simpson|first1=Jared T.|last2=Workman|first2=Rachael|last3=Zuzarte|first3=Philip C.|last4=David|first4=Matei|last5=Dursi|first5=Lewis Jonathan|last6=Timp|first6=Winston|date=2016-04-04|title=Detecting DNA Methylation using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer|biorxiv=10.1101/047142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third generation sequencing technologies offer the capability for single molecule real-time sequencing of longer reads, and detection of DNA modification without the aforementioned assay.&lt;ref name="Flusberg 461–465"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Flusberg|first1=Benjamin A.|last2=Webster|first2=Dale R.|last3=Lee|first3=Jessica H.|last4=Travers|first4=Kevin J.|last5=Olivares|first5=Eric C.|last6=Clark|first6=Tyson A.|last7=Korlach|first7=Jonas|last8=Turner|first8=Stephen W.|date=2010-06-01|title=Direct detection of DNA methylation during single-molecule, real-time sequencing|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=7|issue=6|pages=461–465|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1459|pmc=2879396|pmid=20453866}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:3rd gen Epigenetics.png|thumb|577x577px|PacBio SMRT technology and Oxford Nanopore can use unaltered DNA to detect methylation.]]
[[Oxford Nanopore Technologies]]’ [[MinION]] has been used to detect DNAm. As each DNA strand passes through a pore, it produces electrical signals which have been found to be sensitive to epigenetic changes in the nucleotides, and a [[hidden Markov model]] (HMM) was used to analyze MinION data to detect [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] (5mC) DNA modification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The model was trained using synthetically methylated [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] DNA and the resulting signals measured by the nanopore technology. Then the trained model was used to detect 5mC in MinION genomic reads from a human cell line which already had a reference methylome. The classifier has 82% accuracy in randomly sampled singleton sites, which increases to 95% when more stringent thresholds are applied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other methods address different types of DNA modifications using the MinION platform. Stoiber et al. examined 4-methylcytosine (4mC) and 6-methyladenine (6mA), along with 5mC, and also created software to directly visualize the raw MinION data in a human-friendly way.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite bioRxiv|last1=Stoiber|first1=Marcus H.|last2=Quick|first2=Joshua|last3=Egan|first3=Rob|last4=Lee|first4=Ji Eun|last5=Celniker|first5=Susan E.|last6=Neely|first6=Robert|last7=Loman|first7=Nicholas|last8=Pennacchio|first8=Len|last9=Brown|first9=James B.|date=2016-12-15|title=De novo Identification of DNA Modifications Enabled by Genome-Guided Nanopore Signal Processing|biorxiv=10.1101/094672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they found that in ''E. coli'', which has a known [[methylome]], event windows of 5 base pairs long can be used to divide and statistically analyze the raw MinION electrical signals. A straightforward [[Mann–Whitney U test|Mann-Whitney U test]] can detect modified portions of the ''E. coli'' sequence, as well as further split the modifications into 4mC, 6mA or 5mC regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It seems likely that in the future, MinION raw data will be used to detect many different epigenetic marks in DNA.

[[Pacific Biosciences|PacBio]] sequencing has also been used to detect DNA methylation. In this platform, the pulse width – the width of a fluorescent light pulse – corresponds to a specific base. In 2010 it was shown that the interpulse distance in control and methylated samples are different, and there is a "signature" pulse width for each methylation type.&lt;ref name="Flusberg 461–465" /&gt; In 2012 using the PacBio platform the binding sites of DNA [[methyltransferase]]s were characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=T.

Other forms of DNA modifications – from heavy metals, oxidation, or UV damage – are also possible avenues of research using Oxford Nanopore and PacBio third generation sequencing.

=== Drawbacks ===
Processing of the raw data – such as normalization to the median signal – was needed on MinION raw data, reducing real-time capability of the technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consistency of the electrical signals is still an issue, making it difficult to accurately call a nucleotide. MinION has low throughput; since multiple overlapping reads are hard to obtain, this further leads to accuracy problems of downstream DNA modification detection. Both the hidden Markov model and statistical methods used with MinION raw data require repeated observations of DNA modifications for detection, meaning that individual modified nucleotides need to be consistently present in multiple copies of the genome, e.g. in multiple cells or plasmids in the sample.

For the PacBio platform, too, depending on what methylation you expect to find, coverage needs can vary. As of March 2017, other epigenetic factors like histone modifications have not been discoverable using third-generation technologies. Longer patterns of methylation are often lost because smaller contigs still need to be assembled.

== Transcriptomics ==
[[Transcriptomics]] is the study of the [[transcriptome]], usually by characterizing the relative abundances of messenger RNA molecules in the tissue under study. According to the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], genetic information flows from double stranded DNA molecules to single stranded mRNA molecules where they can be readily translated into function protein molecules. By studying the transcriptome, one can gain valuable insight into the regulation of gene expressions.

While expression levels as the gene level can be more or less accurately depicted by second generation sequencing, transcript-level information still remains an important challenge.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Steijger|first1=Tamara|last2=Abril|first2=Josep F.|last3=Engström|first3=Pär G.|last4=Kokocinski|first4=Felix|last5=The RGASP Consortium|last6=Hubbard|first6=Tim J.|last7=Guigó|first7=Roderic|last8=Harrow|first8=Jennifer|last9=Bertone|first9=Paul|date=2013-12-01|title=Assessment of transcript reconstruction methods for RNA-seq|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1177–1184|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2714|issn=1548-7091|pmc=3851240|pmid=24185837}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the role of alternative splicing in molecular biology remains largely elusive. Third generation sequencing technologies hold promising prospects in resolving this issue by enabling sequencing of mRNA molecules at their full lengths.

=== Alternative splicing ===
[[Alternative splicing]] (AS) is the process by which a single gene may give rise to multiple distinct mRNA transcripts and consequently different protein translations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graveley|first=Brenton R.|title=Alternative splicing: increasing diversity in the proteomic world|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=17|issue=2|pages=100–107|doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(00)02176-4|year=2001|pmid=11173120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence suggests that AS is a ubiquitous phenomenon and may play a key role in determining the phenotypes of organisms, especially in complex eukaryotes; all eukaryotes contain genes consisting of introns that may undergo AS. In particular, it has been estimated that AS occurs in 95% of all human multi-exon genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pan|first1=Qun|last2=Shai|first2=Ofer|last3=Lee|first3=Leo J.|last4=Frey|first4=Brendan J.|last5=Blencowe|first5=Benjamin J.|date=2008-12-01|title=Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing|journal=Nature Genetics|language=en|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1413–1415|doi=10.1038/ng.259|pmid=18978789|s2cid=9228930|issn=1061-4036}}&lt;/ref&gt; AS has undeniable potential to influence myriad biological processes. Advancing knowledge in this area has critical implications for the study of biology in general.

=== Transcript reconstruction ===
The current generation of sequencing technologies produce only short reads, putting tremendous limitation on the ability to detect distinct transcripts; short reads must be reverse engineered into original transcripts that could have given rise to the resulting read observations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pertea|first1=Mihaela|last2=Pertea|first2=Geo M.|last3=Antonescu|first3=Corina M.|last4=Chang|first4=Tsung-Cheng|last5=Mendell|first5=Joshua T.|last6=Salzberg|first6=Steven L.|date=2015-03-01|title=StringTie enables improved reconstruction of a transcriptome from RNA-seq reads|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=290–295|doi=10.1038/nbt.3122|issn=1087-0156|pmc=4643835|pmid=25690850}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is further complicated by the highly variable expression levels across transcripts, and consequently variable read coverages across the sequence of the gene.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In addition, exons may be shared among individual transcripts, rendering unambiguous inferences essentially impossible.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Existing computational methods make inferences based on the accumulation of short reads at various sequence locations often by making simplifying assumptions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/ Cufflinks] takes a parsimonious approach, seeking to explain all the reads with the fewest possible number of transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Trapnell|first1=Cole|last2=Williams|first2=Brian A.|last3=Pertea|first3=Geo|last4=Mortazavi|first4=Ali|last5=Kwan|first5=Gordon|last6=van Baren|first6=Marijke J.|last7=Salzberg|first7=Steven L.|last8=Wold|first8=Barbara J.|last9=Pachter|first9=Lior|date=2010-05-01|title=Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=511–515|doi=10.1038/nbt.1621|issn=1087-0156|pmc=3146043|pmid=20436464}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, StringTie attempts to simultaneously estimate transcript abundances while assembling the reads.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These methods, while reasonable, may not always identify real transcripts.

A study published in 2008 surveyed 25 different existing transcript reconstruction protocols.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its evidence suggested that existing methods are generally weak in assembling transcripts, though the ability to detect individual exons are relatively intact.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to the estimates, average sensitivity to detect exons across the 25 protocols is 80% for ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' genes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In comparison, transcript identification sensitivity decreases to 65%. For human, the study reported an exon detection sensitivity averaging to 69% and transcript detection sensitivity had an average of a mere 33%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In other words, for human, existing methods are able to identify less than half of all existing transcript.

Third generation sequencing technologies have demonstrated promising prospects in solving the problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation at the level of transcripts.

== Metagenomics ==

[[Metagenomics]] is the analysis of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.

=== Advantages ===
The main advantage for third-generation sequencing technologies in [[metagenomics]] is their speed of sequencing in comparison to second generation techniques. Speed of sequencing is important for example in the clinical setting (i.e. [[pathogen]] identification), to allow for efficient diagnosis and timely clinical actions.

Oxford Nanopore's MinION was used in 2015 for real-time metagenomic detection of pathogens in complex, high-background clinical samples. The first [[Ebola virus]] (EBV) read was sequenced 44 seconds after data acquisition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1-link=Alexander L.

MinION's high error rate (~10-40%) prevented identification of [[antimicrobial resistance]] markers, for which single nucleotide resolution is necessary. For the same reason, [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] pathogens were not identified.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ease of carryover contamination when re-using the same flow cell (standard wash protocols don’t work) is also a concern. Unique barcodes may allow for more multiplexing. Furthermore, performing accurate species identification for [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[Parasitism|parasites]] is very difficult, as they share a larger portion of the genome, and some only differ by &lt;5%.

The per base sequencing cost is still significantly more than that of MiSeq. However, the prospect of supplementing reference databases with full-length sequences from organisms below the limit of detection from the [[Sanger sequencing|Sanger]] approach;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this could possibly greatly help the identification of organisms in metagenomics. &lt;!--{{Problem|state=This sentence does not make sense to me.

The key difference from earlier classifications such as the [[two-empire system]] and the five-kingdom classification is the splitting of archaea from bacteria as completely different organism. It has been challenged by the [[two-domain system]] that divides organisms into Bacteria and Archaea only, as eukaryotes are considered as one group of archaea.&lt;ref name="Gabaldón"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nobs |first=Stephanie-Jane |last2=MacLeod |first2=Fraser I. |last3=Wong |first3=Hon Lun |last4=Burns |first4=Brendan P. |date=2022 |title=Eukarya the chimera: eukaryotes, a secondary innovation of the two domains of life? |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0966842X21002699 |journal=Trends in Microbiology |language=en |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=421–431 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2021.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doolittle |first=W.

==Background==
Woese argued, on the basis of differences in [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] [[gene]]s, that bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed [[genetics|genetic]] machinery, often called a [[progenote]]. To reflect these primary lines of descent, he treated each as a domain, divided into several different [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Originally his split of the prokaryotes was into ''Eubacteria'' (now ''Bacteria'') and ''Archaebacteria'' (now ''Archaea''). Woese initially used the term "kingdom" to refer to the three primary phylogenic groupings, and this nomenclature was widely used until the term "domain" was adopted in 1990.&lt;ref name=w1990/&gt;

Acceptance of the validity of Woese's phylogenetically valid classification was a slow process. Prominent biologists including [[Salvador Luria]] and [[Ernst Mayr]] objected to his division of the prokaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Two empires or three?| doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.17.9720| volume = 95

A decade of labor-intensive [[oligonucleotide]] cataloging left him with a reputation as "a crank," and Woese would go on to be dubbed "Microbiology's Scarred Revolutionary" by a news article printed in the journal ''[[science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1997.&lt;ref name="morell1997"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Microbiology's scarred revolutionary| doi = 10.1126/science.276.5313.699| issn = 0036-8075| volume = 276| issue = 5313| pages = 699–702| last = Morell| first = V.| journal = Science| date = 1997-05-02| pmid = 9157549| s2cid = 84866217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing amount of supporting data led the [[scientific community]] to accept the Archaea by the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="sapp2009"&gt;{{Cite book

}}
The three-domain system adds a level of classification (the domains) "above" the kingdoms present in the previously used five- or [[six-kingdom system]]s. This classification system recognizes the fundamental divide between the two prokaryotic groups, insofar as Archaea appear to be more closely related to Eukaryotes than they are to other [[prokaryotes]] – bacteria-like organisms with no [[cell nucleus]]. The three-domain system sorts the previously known kingdoms into these three domains: [[Archaea]], [[Bacteria]], and [[Eukarya]].&lt;ref name="Gabaldón"/&gt;

===Domain Archaea===
The [[Archaea]] are [[prokaryotic]], with no nuclear membrane, but with biochemistry and RNA markers that are distinct from bacteria. The [[Archaea]]ns possess unique, ancient evolutionary history for which they are considered some of the oldest species of organisms on Earth, most notably their diverse, exotic metabolisms.

Some examples of archaeal organisms are:
* [[methanogens]] – which produce the gas [[methane]]
* [[halophiles]] – which live in very salty water
* [[thermoacidophiles]] – which thrive in acidic high-temperature water

===Domain Bacteria===
The [[Bacteria]] are also [[prokaryotic]]; their domain consists of cells with bacterial rRNA, no nuclear membrane, and whose membranes possess primarily ''diacyl glycerol diester lipids''. Traditionally classified as bacteria, many thrive in the same environments favored by humans, and were the first [[prokaryote]]s discovered; they were briefly called the '''Eubacteria''' or "true" bacteria when the Archaea were first recognized as a distinct [[clade]].

Most known pathogenic prokaryotic organisms belong to bacteria (see&lt;ref name="Eckburg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eckburg |first1=Paul B. |last2=Lepp |first2=Paul W. |last3=Relman |first3=David A. |year=2003 |title=Archaea and their potential role in human disease |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=591–596 |doi=10.1128/IAI.71.2.591-596.2003 |pmid=12540534 |pmc=145348}}&lt;/ref&gt; for exceptions). For that reason, and because the Archaea are typically difficult to grow in laboratories, Bacteria are currently studied more extensively than Archaea.

Some examples of bacteria include:
* "[[Cyanobacteria]]" – photosynthesizing bacteria that are related to the chloroplasts of eukaryotic plants and algae
* [[Spirochaetota]] – [[Gram-negative]] bacteria that include those causing syphilis and Lyme disease
* [[Actinomycetota]] – [[Gram-positive]] bacteria including ''[[Bifidobacterium animalis]]'' which is present in the human large intestine

===Domain Eukarya===
[[Eukarya]] are organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus. They include many large single-celled organisms and all known non-[[microscopic organism]]s. A partial list of eukaryotic organisms includes:

;[[Fungi|Kingdom Fungi]] or fungi:
* [[Saccharomycotina]] – includes true yeasts
* [[Basidiomycota]] – includes mushrooms
;[[Plant|Kingdom Plantae]] or plants:
* [[Bryophyte|Bryophyta]] – mosses
* [[Magnoliophyta]] – flowering plants
;[[Animal|Kingdom Animalia]] or animals:
* [[Chordata]] – includes [[vertebrate]]s as a subphylum
;[[Protozoa|Kingdom Protista]] or protozoans:
* [[Euglenoids]] – includes [[euglena]] as an organism

==Niches==
Each of the three cell types tends to fit into recurring specialities or roles. Bacteria tend to be the most prolific reproducers, at least in moderate environments. Archaeans tend to adapt quickly to extreme environments, such as high temperatures, high acids, high sulfur, etc. This includes adapting to use a wide variety of food sources. Eukaryotes are the most flexible with regard to forming cooperative colonies, such as in multi-cellular organisms, including humans. In fact, the structure of a eukaryote is likely to have derived from a joining of different cell types, forming [[organelle]]s.

''[[Parakaryon myojinensis]]'' (''[[incertae sedis]]'') is a single-celled organism known to be a unique example. "This organism appears to be a life form distinct from [[prokaryotes]] and [[eukaryotes]]",&lt;ref name=yamaguchi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamaguchi M, Mori Y, Kozuka Y, Okada H, Uematsu K, Tame A, Furukawa H, Maruyama T, Worman CO, Yokoyama K | title = Prokaryote or eukaryote?

Recent work has proposed that Eukarya may have actually branched off from the domain Archaea. According to Spang ''et al.''

Thrifty phenotype refers to the correlation between low birth weight of neonates and the increased risk of developing metabolic syndromes later in life, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vaag AA, Grunnet LG, Arora GP, Brøns C | title = The thrifty phenotype hypothesis revisited | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 55 | issue = 8 | pages = 2085–2088 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22643933 | pmc = 3390698 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-012-2589-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although early life undernutrition is thought to be the key driving factor to the hypothesis, other environmental factors have been explored for their role in susceptibility, such as physical inactivity. Genes may also play a role in susceptibility of these diseases, as they may make individuals predisposed to factors that lead to increased disease risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CN, Barker DJ | title = The thrifty phenotype hypothesis | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–20 | date = 2001-11-01 | pmid = 11809615 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/60.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Historical overview ==
The term Thrifty Phenotype was first coined by Hales and barker in a study published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CN, Barker DJ | title = Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus: the thrifty phenotype hypothesis | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 595–601 | date = July 1992 | pmid = 1644236 | doi = 10.1007/BF00400248 | s2cid = 35676219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, the authors reviewed the literature up to and addressed five central questions regarding role of different factors in type 2 diabetes on which they based their hypothesis. These questions included the following:

# The role of beta cell deficiency in type 2 diabetes.
# The extent to which beta cell deficiency contributes to insulin intolerance.
# The role of major nutritional elements in fetal growth.
# The role of abnormal amino acid supply in growth retarded neonates.
# The role of malnutrition in irreversibly defective beta cell growth.

From the review of the existing literature, they posited that poor nutritional status in fetal and early neonatal stages could hamper the development and proper functioning of the pancreatic beta cells by impacting structural features of islet anatomy, which could consequently make the individual more susceptible to the development of type 2 diabetes in later life. However, they did not exclude other causal factors such as obesity, ageing and physical inactivity as determining factors of type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CN, Barker DJ | title = Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus: the thrifty phenotype hypothesis | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 595–601 | date = July 1992 | pmid = 1644236 | doi = 10.1007/BF00400248 | s2cid = 35676219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later study, Barker et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker DJ, Hales CN, Fall CH, Osmond C, Phipps K, Clark PM | title = Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia (syndrome X): relation to reduced fetal growth | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–67 | date = January 1993 | pmid = 8436255 | doi = 10.1007/BF00399095 | s2cid = 27195536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed living patient data from Hertfordshire, UK and found that men in their sixties having low birthweight (2.95 kg or less) were 10 times more likely to develop syndrome X (type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia) than men of the same age whose birthweight was 4.31 kg or more. This statistical correlation was independent of the gestation period and other possible confounding factors such as current social class or social class at birth, smoking, and consumption of alcohol. Furthermore, they argued that they were likely to underestimate this association, since they could only sample the surviving patients, and patients having more severe manifestations of syndrome X were less likely to survive to that age.

In 1994, Phillips’ et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips DI, Barker DJ, Hales CN, Hirst S, Osmond C | title = Thinness at birth and insulin resistance in adult life | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–154 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8163048 | doi = 10.1007/s001250050086 | s2cid = 10064670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  found statistically significant association between thinness in birth (measured as Ponderal index) and insulin resistance, the association being independent of length of gestation period, adult body mass index, and confounding factors like then current social class or social class at birth. 

In 2001, Hales and Barker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CN, Barker DJ | title = The thrifty phenotype hypothesis | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–20 | date = 2001-11-01 | pmid = 11809615 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/60.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; updated the hypothesis by positing that the thrifty phenotype may be an evolutionary adaptation: the thrifty phenotype responds to fetal malnutrition by selectively preserving more vital organs of the body and preparing the fetus for a postnatal environment where resources will be scarce.

== Evolutionary rationale ==

=== Offspring ===
Maternal nutrition can affect the development of the unborn child in poor nutritional environments such that it will be prepared for survival within that poor environment. This results in a thrifty [[phenotype]] ([[Charles Nicholas Hales|Hales]] &amp; Barker, 1992&lt;ref name = "Hales_2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CN, Barker DJ | title = The thrifty phenotype hypothesis | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 60 | pages = 5–20 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11809615 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/60.1.5 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  It is sometimes called '''Barker's hypothesis''', after Professor [[David Barker (epidemiologist)|David J. P. Barker]],  researching at the [[University of Southampton]] who published the theory in 1990.&lt;ref name="Barker_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker DJ | title = Maternal nutrition, fetal nutrition, and disease in later life | journal = Nutrition | location = Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif. | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 807–13 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9290095 | doi = 10.1016/s0899-9007(97)00193-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metabolic ===
The thrifty phenotype hypothesis says that early-life [[metabolic]] adaptations help in survival of the organism by selecting an appropriate trajectory of growth in response to environmental cues. An example of this is type 2 diabetes. In their review, Barker and Hayes discuss evidence that [[Beta cell|beta cells]] abnormally develop due to malnutrition during fetal development, causing insulin abnormalities later in life. The review also notes that low birth weight alone does not necessarily mean that it is a manifestation of Thrifty Phenotype. Since low birth weight is not exclusively caused by maternal malnutrition, meaning that other factors could influence the low birth weight- disease relationship.&lt;ref name = "Hales_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CN, Barker DJ | title = The thrifty phenotype hypothesis | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–20 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11809615 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/60.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the term “Thrifty Phenotype” was coined, Barker had noted the phenomenon with cardiovascular disease. In his lecture paper, he discusses the role of malnutrition during fetal development in Obstructed Lung Disease (now known as [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]]), [[Coronary artery disease|Ischemic heart disease]], and blood pressure. In each of these diseases, there was an association with social class and development prevalence of the disease. This was determined to be due to issues of malnutrition during key points in organ development in utero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker DJ | title = The intrauterine origins of cardiovascular and obstructive lung disease in adult life. The Marc Daniels Lecture 1990 | journal = Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of London | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–133 | date = April 1991 | pmid = 2066923 | pmc = 5377211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefit for mother ===
However, environmental changes during early development may result in the selected trajectory becoming inappropriate, resulting in adverse effects on health. This paradox generates doubts about whether the thrifty phenotype is adaptive for human offspring. Thus, the thrifty phenotype should be considered as the capacity of all offspring to respond to environmental cues during early [[ontogenetic]] development. It has been suggested that the thrifty phenotype is the consequence of three unlike adaptive processes: maternal effects, niche construction and developmental plasticity, which all are influenced by the brain. While developmental plasticity demonstrates an adaptation by the offspring, [[niche cell|niche]] construction and parental effects are result of parental selections rather than offspring fitness. Therefore, the thrifty phenotype can be described as a manipulation of offspring phenotype for the benefit of maternal fitness. The information that enters [[offspring]] phenotype during early development mirror the mother's own developmental experience and the quality of the environment during her own maturation rather than predicting the possible future environment of the offspring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells JC | title = The thrifty phenotype as an adaptive maternal effect | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–172 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17313527 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2006.00007.x | s2cid = 35671934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other consequences ===
Not all research into this topic has been conducted on diseases. Other research has explored the thrifty phenotype hypothesis as a causal factor for differing development into puberty and adulthood. A review on the literature, up to 2013, discussed not only the hierarchical tissue preservation within pancreatic cells, but research on limb shortening to preserve development of more vital organs and bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells JC | title = Commentary: The thrifty phenotype and the hierarchical preservation of tissues under stress | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 1223–1227 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24159066 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyt130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this phenomenon is a study published in 2018 by the Royal Society, which found that hypoxic stress from differing altitudes affected offspring limb length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne S, Kumar Bc R, Pomeroy E, Macintosh A, Stock J | title = Thrifty phenotype versus cold adaptation: trade-offs in upper limb proportions of Himalayan populations of Nepal | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 172174 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 30110416 | pmc = 6030304 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.172174 | bibcode = 2018RSOS....572174P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal overnutrition may also play a key role in development, increasing the likelihood of early puberty and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Robertson OC, Marceau K, Moding KJ, Knopik VS |date= September 2022 |title=Developmental pathways linking obesity risk and early puberty: The thrifty phenotype and fetal overnutrition hypotheses |journal= Developmental Review |language=en |volume=66 |pages=101048 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2022.101048|s2cid= 252374591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adverse effects ==
Many human diseases in adulthood are related to growth patterns during early life, determining early-life nutrition as the underlying mechanism. Individuals with a thrifty phenotype will have "a smaller body size, a lowered metabolic rate and a reduced level of behavioural activity… adaptations to an environment that is chronically short of food" (Bateson &amp; Martin, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Martin P, Bateson P |title=Design for a life: How behaviour develops |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |year=1999 |pages=110–1 |isbn=0-224-05064-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Those with a thrifty phenotype who actually develop in an affluent environment may be more prone to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type II diabetes]], whereas those who have received a positive maternal forecast will be adapted to good conditions and therefore better able to cope with rich diets. This idea (Barker, 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Barker DJ |title=Fetal and infant origins of adult disease |publisher=British Medical Journal |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-7279-0743-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is now widely (if not universally) accepted and is a source of concern for societies undergoing a transition from sparse to better nutrition (Robinson, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson R | title = The fetal origins of adult disease | journal = BMJ | volume = 322 | issue = 7283 | pages = 375–376 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11179140 | pmc = 1119617 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.322.7283.375 }} Editorial&lt;/ref&gt;).

Risk factors of thrifty phenotype include [[advanced maternal age]] and [[placental insufficiency]].&lt;ref name=Aiken2013/&gt;

== Molecular mechanisms ==
The ability to conserve, acquire and expend energy is believed to be an innate, ancient trait that is imbedded in the genome in a way that is quite protected against [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name=Stoger2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stöger R | title = The thrifty epigenotype: an acquired and heritable predisposition for obesity and diabetes? | journal = BioEssays | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 156–166 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18197594 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20700 | s2cid = 15432962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are also believed to possibly be inherited across generations.&lt;ref name=Stoger2008/&gt; Leptin has been identified as a possible gene for the acquisition of these thrifty traits.&lt;ref name=Stoger2008/&gt;

On a larger anatomic scale, the molecular mechanisms are broadly caused by a suboptimal environment in the [[reproductive tract]] or [[maternal physiological adaptations to pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Aiken2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aiken CE, Ozanne SE | title = Transgenerational developmental programming | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–75 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24082037 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt043 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barley tillering.JPG|thumb|These barley plants are in the tillering stage]]
A '''tiller''' is a [[shoot]] that arises from the base of a [[Poaceae|grass]] plant. The term refers to all shoots that grow after the initial parent shoot grows from a seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Adrian|title=Plant Form|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0-19-854219-4|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://caes2.caes.uga.edu/commodities/turfgrass/georgiaturf/Turfgras/1130_DiagramParts.htm Parts of a Grass Plant] for an illustration.&lt;/ref&gt; Tillers are segmented, each segment possessing its own two-part leaf. They are involved in vegetative propagation and, in some cases, also seed production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trlica|first=M|title=Grass Growth and Response to Grazing|url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/natres/06108.html|work=Fact sheet 6.108|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

"Tillering" refers to the production of side shoots and is a property possessed by many species in the grass family. This enables them to produce multiple [[Plant stem|stem]]s (tillers) starting from the initial single seedling.  This ensures the formation of dense tufts and multiple seed heads. Tillering rates are heavily influenced by soil water quantity.  When soil moisture is low, grasses tend to develop more sparse and deep root systems (as opposed to dense, lateral systems).  Thus, in dry soils, tillering is inhibited: the lateral nature of tillering is not supported by lateral root growth.

'''Time-lapse microscopy''' is [[time-lapse photography]] applied to [[microscopy]].
Microscope image sequences are recorded and then viewed at a greater speed to
give an accelerated view of the microscopic process.

Before the introduction of the [[video tape recorder]] in the 1960s, time-lapse microscopy recordings
were made on [[photographic film]].
During this period, time-lapse microscopy was referred to as '''microcinematography'''.
With the increasing use of video recorders, the term '''time-lapse video microscopy''' was gradually adopted.
Today, the term '''video''' is increasingly dropped, reflecting that a [[digital camera|digital still camera]]
is used to record the individual image frames, instead of a video recorder.

==Applications==

}}
Time-lapse microscopy can be used to observe any microscopic object over time. However, its main use is within [[cell biology]] to observe artificially [[cell culture|cultured cells]]. Depending on the cell culture, different microscopy techniques can be applied to enhance characteristics of the cells as most cells are transparent.&lt;ref name="NobelPhase"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Phase Contrast Microscope | publisher=Nobel Media AB | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/microscopes/phase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enhance observations further, cells have therefore traditionally been [[cell staining|stained]] before observation. Unfortunately, the staining process kills the cells. The development of less destructive staining methods and methods to observe unstained cells has led to that cell biologists increasingly observe living cells. This is known as [[live cell imaging]]. A few tools have been developed to identify and analyze single cells during live cell imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stylianidou | first1 = Stella | last2 = Brennan | first2 = Connor | last3 = Nissen | first3 = Silas B. | last4 = Kuwada | first4 = Nathan J. | last5 = Wiggins | first5 = Paul A. | title=SuperSegger: robust image segmentation, analysis and lineage tracking of bacterial cells | journal=Molecular Microbiology | date=August 29, 2016 | volume=102 | issue = 4 | pages=690–700 |doi=10.1111/mmi.13486 | pmid = 27569113 | s2cid = 10684951 | url = https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/209799494/SuperSegger_robust_image_segmentation_analysis_and_lineage_tracking_of_bacterial_cells.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = Jonathan W. | last2 = Locke | first2 = James C.

Modern approaches are further extending time-lapse microscopy observations beyond making movies of cellular dynamics.
Traditionally, cells have been observed in a microscope and measured in a [[cytometry|cytometer]].
Increasingly this boundary is blurred as [[cytometry|cytometric techniques]] are being integrated with imaging techniques for monitoring and measuring
dynamic activities of cells and [[subcellular]] structures.&lt;ref name="Coutu" /&gt;
==History==
[[File:Marey's micro-cinematograph.png|thumb|One of the microcinematographs used at the Marey Institute during the late 19th century.]]

''[[The Cheese Mites]]'' by Martin Duncan from 1903 is one of the earliest microcinematographic films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cheese mites and other wonders | first=Finlo | last=Rohrer | publisher=BBC News Magazine | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1336505 | access-date=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early development of scientific microcinematography took place in Paris. The first reported time-lapse microscope was assembled in the late 1890s at the Marey Institute, founded by the pioneer of [[chronophotography]], [[Étienne-Jules Marey]].&lt;ref name="Talbot"&gt;{{cite book | title=Practical cinematography and its applications | first=Frederick A. | last=Talbot | year=1913 | publisher=W.

At the time, the ultramicroscope was the only microscope in which the thin spiral shaped bacteria was visible.
Using an enormous cinema camera bolted to the fragile microscope, he demonstrated visually that the
movement of the disease-causing bacteria is uniquely different from the non-disease-causing form.
Comandon's films proved instrumental in teaching doctors how to distinguish the two forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bayly | first1 = H.

Comandon's extensive pioneering work inspired others to adopt microcinematography.
Heniz Rosenberger builds a microcinematograph in the mid 1920s.
In collerboration with [[Alexis Carrel]], they used the device to further develop Carrel's [[cell culture|cell culturing techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Heinz | last=Rosenberger | title=Micro-Cinematography in Medical Research | journal=J Dent Res | year=1929 | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=343–352 | doi=10.1177/00220345290090030501| s2cid=71952151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar work was conducted by Warren Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Warren H.

During World War II, Carl Zeiss AG released the first [[phase-contrast microscope]] on the market.
With this new microscope, cellular details could for the first time be observed without using lethal stains.&lt;ref name="NobelPhase" /&gt;
By setting up some of the first time-lapse experiments with chicken [[fibroblasts]] and a phase-contrast microscope,
[[Michael Abercrombie]] described the basis of our current understanding of [[cell migration]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Monica | last=Hoyos-Flight | title=Milestone 2: Nature Milestones in Cytoskeleton | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | url=http://www.nature.com/milestones/milecyto/full/milecyto02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(53)90098-6 | last1 = Abercrombie | first1 = M. | last2 = Heaysman | first2 = J.

With the broad introduction of the [[digital camera]] at the beginning of this century,
time-lapse microscopy has been made dramatically more accessible and is currently experiencing
an unrepresented raise in scientific publications.&lt;ref name="Coutu" /&gt;

      <text bytes="2790" xml:space="preserve">'''Tissue heterogeneity''' refers to the fact that data generated with biological samples can be compromised by cells originating from other [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s or organs than the target tissue or [[Organ (biology)|organ]] of profiling.&lt;ref name="Zhang2017"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1186/s12864-017-3661-2| issn = 1471-2164| volume = 18| pages = 277| last1 = Zhang| first1 = Jitao David| last2 = Hatje| first2 = Klas| last3 = Sturm| first3 = Gregor| last4 = Broger| first4 = Clemens| last5 = Ebeling| first5 = Martin| last6 = Burtin| first6 = Martine| last7 = Terzi| first7 = Fabiola| last8 = Pomposiello| first8 = Silvia Ines| last9 = Badi| first9 = Laura| title = Detect tissue heterogeneity in gene expression data with BioQC| journal = BMC Genomics| accessdate = 2017-04-10| date = 2017| url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-3661-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be caused by biological processes (such as immune cell infiltration), sample contamination, or mistakes in sample labelling. Tissue heterogeneity affects commonly used, reference gene expression datasets such as [[Functional_genomics#The_Genotype-Tissue_Expression_%28GTEx%29_project|the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nieuwenhuis |first1=Tim O. |last2=Yang |first2=Stephanie Y. |last3=Verma |first3=Rohan X. |last4=Pillalamarri |first4=Vamsee |last5=Arking |first5=Dan E. |last6=Rosenberg |first6=Avi Z. |last7=McCall |first7=Matthew N. |last8=Halushka |first8=Marc K. |title=Consistent RNA sequencing contamination in GTEx and other data sets |journal=Nature Communications |date=22 April 2020 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=1933 |doi=10.1038/s41467-020-15821-9 |pmc=7176728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer samples often display varying degree of heterogeneity, because they consist of tumor cells of multiple subclones, immune cells, and other cell types. Beyond cancer, many gene expression studies are affected by tissue heterogeneity. The prevalence of tissue heterogeneity in publicly available gene-expression studies is estimated between 1% and 40%, varying by tissues of origin.&lt;ref name="Sturm2021"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Gregor |last2=List |first2=Markus |last3=Zhang |first3=Jitao David |title=Tissue heterogeneity is prevalent in gene expression studies |journal=NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics |date=23 June 2021 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=lqab077 |pmid=34514392|doi=10.1093/nargab/lqab077 |pmc=8415427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detected tissue heterogeneity may be used to weight samples in differential gene-expression analysis to reduce the impact of the heterogeneity. Alternatively, the gene expression profile may be analyzed by [[cellular deconvolution]] algorithms to infer the composition of cell types.

'''Tissue hydration''' is the process of absorbing and retaining [[water]] in [[Tissue (biology)|biological tissues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of tissue hydration on nanoscale structural morphology and mechanics of individual Type I collagen fibrils in the Brtl mouse model of Osteogenesis Imperfecta|date=December 2012|display-authors=etal|first1=Arika D. |last1=Kemp|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|doi= 10.1016/j.jsb.2012.09.012|volume=180|issue=3|pages=428–438|pmc=3685442|pmid=23041293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Land plants maintain adequate tissue hydration by means of an outer waterproof layer.  In soft or green tissues, this is usually a waxy [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] over the outer [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]].  In older, [[wood]]y tissues, waterproofing chemicals are present in the secondary [[cell wall]] that limit or inhibit the flow of water.  [[Vascular plant]]s also possess an internal [[vascular system]] that distributes fluids throughout the plant.

Some [[xerophyte]]s, such as [[Cactus|cacti]] and other desert plants, have mucilage in their tissues.  This is a sticky substance that holds water within the plant, reducing the rate of dehydration.  Some [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s remain dormant until adequate moisture is present, at which time the seed or spore begins to germinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mucilage in Cacti: Its Apoplastic Capacitance, Associated Solutes, and Influence on Tissue Water Relations|first1=Park S. |last1=Nobel|first2=Jaime|last2=Cavelier|first3=Jose Luis|last3=Andrade|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=43|issue=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
Animals maintain adequate tissue hydration by means of (1) an outer [[skin]], [[Exoskeleton|shell]], or [[cuticle]]; (2) a fluid-filled [[coelom]] cavity; and (3) a [[circulatory system]].

Hydration of fat free tissues, ratio of total body water to fat free body mass, is stable at 0.73 in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heymsfield|first=Steven B.|last2=Baumgartner|first2=Richard N.|last3=Pietrobelli|first3=Angelo|last4=Wang|first4=Wei|last5=Deurenberg|first5=Paul|last6=Wang|first6=ZiMian|date=1999-05-01|title=Hydration of fat-free body mass: review and critique of a classic body-composition constant|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|language=en|volume=69|issue=5|pages=833–841|doi=10.1093/ajcn/69.5.833|pmid=10232621|issn=0002-9165|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In humans, a significant drop in tissue hydration can lead to the medical condition of [[dehydration]].  This may result from loss of water itself, loss of electrolytes, or a loss of blood plasma.  Administration of [[hydrational fluid]]s as part of sound [[Fluid replacement|dehydration management]] is necessary to avoid severe complications, and in some cases, death. 

Some invertebrates are able to survive extreme [[desiccation]] of their tissues by entering a state of [[cryptobiosis]].

'''TK''' is an experimental cell therapy which may be used to treat high-risk [[leukemia]].  It is currently undergoing a [[Phases of clinical research|Phase III clinical trial]] to determine efficacy and clinical usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00914628|title = TK008: Randomized Phase III Trial of Haploidentical HCT with or Without an Add Back Strategy of HSV-Tk Donor Lymphocytes in Patients with High Risk Acute Leukemia|date = 12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molmed.com/sites/default/files/uploads/press-releases/2481-tk_scientific_results_and_regulatory_path_will_be_presented_today_at_the_40deg_annual_ebmt_meeting_/2481_1396283918.pdf TK scientific results and regulatory path will be presented today at the 40° annual meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation]&lt;/ref&gt;

TK is currently being investigated in patients with acute [[leukemia]] in first or subsequent complete remission and at high risk of relapse or in patients with relapsed disease who are candidates for haploidentical transplantation of hemopoietic stem cells (taken from a partially HLA-compatible family donor).&lt;ref&gt;"Ciceri F, Bonini C, Stanghellini MT, et al. Infusion of suicide-gene-engineered donor lymphocytes after family haploidentical haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation for leukaemia (the TK007 trial): a non-randomised phase I-II study". Lancet Oncol 2009;10(5):489-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

TK is a cellular therapy based on the genetical engineering of donor  [[T lymphocytes]]  in order  to express a suicide gene (thymidine kinase of the Herplex Simplex virus, namely TK) &lt;ref&gt;"Verzeletti S, Bonini C, Marktel S, et al. Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene transfer for controlled graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-leukemia: clinical follow-up and improved new vectors". Hum Gene Ther 1998;9(15):2243-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bonini C, Ferrari G, Verzeletti S, et al. HSV-TK gene transfer into donor lymphocytes for control of allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia". Science 1997;276(5319):1719-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the  lymphocytes donated by partially compatible family donors (haplo-transplant) have been  genetically modified, they can  be infused in patients in need of hematopoietic cell transplantation.
The infusion of lymphocytes expressing the TK suicide gene, has the aim to prevent or treat leukemic relapse and promote immune reconstitution, necessary to protect patients from infections that often limit transplant efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;"Ciceri F. HSV-TK engineered donor lymphocytes provide immune reconstitution after haplo-identical stem cell transplantation". In: EBMT Annual Meeting; 2003; Istanbul; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of TK allows for retention of  immune protection and anti-leukaemic effects of donor T lymphocytes and at the same time to control and annul possible harmful reactions between these lymphocytes and healthy tissues of the patient, reaction known as [[graft-versus-host disease]] (GvHD).

Activation of the cell suicide system is obtained by the administration of ganciglovir, an antiviral drug, which only leads to the death of  cells expressing TK in patients with GvHD.
'''TK''' has been granted Orphan Drug&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/orphans/2009/11/human_orphan_000465.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d12b European Medicines Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; designation both in the EU and the United States &lt;ref&gt;"Helene M, Lake-Bullock V, Bryson JS, Jennings CD, Kaplan AM.

{{TOC_Right}}
A '''TNF inhibitor''' is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] that suppresses the physiologic response to [[tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF), which is part of the [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]]. TNF is involved in autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[psoriasis]], [[hidradenitis suppurativa]] and refractory [[asthma]], so TNF inhibitors may be used in their treatment. The important side effects of TNF inhibitors include lymphomas, infections (especially reactivation of latent [[tuberculosis]]), [[congestive heart failure]], [[demyelinating disease]], a lupus-like syndrome, induction of [[auto-antibodies]], [[injection site reaction]]s, and systemic side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheinfeld N | title = A comprehensive review and evaluation of the side effects of the tumor necrosis factor alpha blockers etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab | journal = The Journal of Dermatological Treatment | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 280–294 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15370396 | doi = 10.1080/09546630410017275 | s2cid = 43332215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global market for TNF inhibitors in 2008 was $13.5 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pappas DA, Bathon JM, Hanicq D, Yasothan U, Kirkpatrick P | title = Golimumab | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 695–696 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19721444 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and $22 billion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knol.google.com/k/top-ten-twenty-best-selling-drugs-2009#Best_selling_therapeutic_categoriesBest_selling_therapeutic_categoriesef |title=Top Ten/Twenty Best Selling Drugs 2009 |access-date=2011-09-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917104658/http://knol.google.com/k/top-ten-twenty-best-selling-drugs-2009 |archive-date=2011-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Inhibition of TNF effects can be achieved with a [[monoclonal antibody]] such as [[infliximab]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scallon B, Cai A, Solowski N, Rosenberg A, Song XY, Shealy D, Wagner C | title = Binding and functional comparisons of two types of tumor necrosis factor antagonists | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 301 | issue = 2 | pages = 418–426 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11961039 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.301.2.418 | s2cid = 43021140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[adalimumab]], [[certolizumab pegol]], and [[golimumab]], or with a circulating receptor [[fusion protein]] such as [[etanercept]].

[[Thalidomide]] and its derivatives [[lenalidomide]] and [[pomalidomide]] are also active against TNF.

While most clinically useful TNF inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies, some are simple molecules such as [[xanthine|xanthine derivatives]]&lt;ref name="pmid11692087"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Essayan DM | title = Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 108 | issue = 5 | pages = 671–680 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11692087 | doi = 10.1067/mai.2001.119555 | s2cid = 21528985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[pentoxifylline]])&lt;ref name="pmid9927365"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marques LJ, Zheng L, Poulakis N, Guzman J, Costabel U | title = Pentoxifylline inhibits TNF-alpha production from human alveolar macrophages | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 159 | issue = 2 | pages = 508–511 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 9927365 | doi = 10.1164/ajrccm.159.2.9804085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bupropion]].&lt;ref name="pmid16644475"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brustolim D, Ribeiro-dos-Santos R, Kast RE, Altschuler EL, Soares MB | title = A new chapter opens in anti-inflammatory treatments: the antidepressant bupropion lowers production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in mice | journal = International Immunopharmacology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–907 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16644475 | doi = 10.1016/j.intimp.2005.12.007 | url = https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/2741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TNF levels have been shown to be raised in both the [[synovial fluid]] and [[synovium]] of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This leads to local inflammation through the signalling of synovial cells to produce [[metalloproteinases]] and [[collagenase]].&lt;ref name="PMC3956207"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ma X, Xu S | title = TNF inhibitor therapy for rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Biomedical Reports | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–184 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 24648915 | pmc = 3956207 | doi = 10.3892/br.2012.42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical application of anti-TNF drugs in rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by [[Marc Feldmann]] and [[Ravinder N. Maini]], who won the 2003 [[Lasker Award]] for their work.&lt;ref name="pmid14520364"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldmann M, Maini RN | title = Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award.

Therapy which combines certain anti-TNF agents such as [[etanercept]] with [[DMARD]]s such as [[methotrexate]] has been shown to be more effective at restoring quality of life to sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis than using either drug alone.&lt;ref name="PMC3956207"/&gt;

=== Skin disease ===
Clinical trials regarding the effectiveness of these drugs on [[hidradenitis suppurativa]] are ongoing.&lt;ref name="pmid19997689"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haslund P, Lee RA, Jemec GB | title = Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa with tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors | journal = Acta Dermato-Venereologica | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 595–600 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19997689 | doi = 10.2340/00015555-0747 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued guidelines for the treatment of severe psoriasis using the anti-TNF drugs etanercept and adalimumab as well as the anti-[[Interleukin 12|IL12]]/[[Interleukin 23 subunit alpha|23]] biological treatment [[ustekinumab]]. In cases where more conventional systemic treatments such as psoralen combined with ultraviolet A treatment ([[PUVA therapy|PUVA]]), [[methotrexate]], and [[ciclosporin]] have failed or can not be tolerated, these newer biological agents may be prescribed. Infliximab may be used to treat severe plaque psoriasis if aforementioned treatments fail or can not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psoriasis-association.org.uk|title=Psoriasis Association|website=psoriasis-association.org.uk|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gastrointestinal disease ===
In 2010 The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK issued guidelines for the treatment of severe [[Crohn's disease|Crohn's Disease]] with infliximab and adalimumab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA187/chapter/1-Guidance|title=Infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease {{!}} 1-guidance {{!}} Guidance and guidelines {{!}} NICE|website=www.nice.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
Anti-TNF therapy has shown only modest effects in cancer therapy. Treatment of [[renal cell carcinoma]] with [[infliximab]] resulted in prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients. [[Etanercept]] was tested for treating patients with [[breast cancer]] and [[ovarian cancer]] showing prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients via downregulation of [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[CCL2]]. On the other hand, adding [[infliximab]] or [[etanercept]] to [[gemcitabine]] for treating patients with advanced [[pancreatic cancer]] was not associated with differences in efficacy when compared with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korneev KV, Atretkhany KN, Drutskaya MS, Grivennikov SI, Kuprash DV, Nedospasov SA | title = TLR-signaling and proinflammatory cytokines as drivers of tumorigenesis | journal = Cytokine | volume = 89 | pages = 127–135 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 26854213 | doi = 10.1016/j.cyto.2016.01.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==

===Cancer===
The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] continues to receive reports of a rare cancer of white blood cells (known as [[hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma]] or HSTCL), primarily in adolescents and young adults being treated for [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]] with TNF blockers, as well as with [[azathioprine]], and/or [[mercaptopurine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/fda/tumor-necrosis-factor-tnf-blockers-azathioprine-mercaptopurine-update-reports-hepatosplenic-t-cell-12945.html|title=FDA Alert: Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blockers, Azathioprine and/or Mercaptopurine: Update on Reports of Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma in Adolescents and Young Adults|website=drugs.com|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunistic infections===
TNF inhibitors put patients at increased risk of certain opportunistic infections. The FDA has warned about the risk of infection from two bacterial pathogens, ''[[Legionella]]'' and ''[[Listeria]]''. People taking TNF blockers are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death due to certain bacterial, [[Mycobacterium|mycobacterial]], fungal, viral, and parasitic opportunistic pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/fda/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-tnf-alpha-blockers-label-change-boxed-warning-updated-risk-infection-13023.html|title=FDA Alert: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα) Blockers: Label Change - Boxed Warning Updated for Risk of Infection from Legionella and Listeria|website=drugs.com|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tuberculosis ====
In patients with latent ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' infection, active [[tuberculosis]] (TB) may develop soon after the initiation of treatment with infliximab.&lt;ref name="pmid11596589"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keane J, Gershon S, Wise RP, Mirabile-Levens E, Kasznica J, Schwieterman WD, Siegel JN, Braun MM | display-authors = 6 | title = Tuberculosis associated with infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha-neutralizing agent | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 345 | issue = 15 | pages = 1098–1104 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11596589 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa011110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before prescribing a TNF inhibitor, physicians should screen patients for latent tuberculosis. The anti-TNF monoclonal antibody biologics infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab and adalimumab, and the [[fusion protein]] [[etanercept]], which are all currently approved by the FDA for human use, have warnings which state that patients should be evaluated for latent TB infection, and if it is detected, preventive treatment should be initiated prior to starting therapy with these medications.

==== Fungal infections ====
The FDA issued a warning on September 4, 2008, that patients on TNF inhibitors are at increased risk of opportunistic fungal infections such as pulmonary and disseminated [[histoplasmosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], and [[blastomycosis]]. They encourage clinicians to consider empiric antifungal therapy in certain circumstances to all patients at risk until the pathogen is identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116942.htm | title = FDA: Manufacturers of TNF-Blocker Drugs Must Highlight Risk of Fungal Infections | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) | date = September 4, 2008 | access-date = 2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review showed that anti-TNFα agents associate with increased infection risks for both endemic and opportunistic invasive fungal infections, particularly when given late in the overall course of treatment of the underlying disease, and in young patients receiving concomitant cytotoxic or augmented immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tragiannidis A, Kyriakidis I, Zündorf I, Groll AH | title = Invasive fungal infections in pediatric patients treated with tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors | journal = Mycoses | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 222–229 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27766695 | doi = 10.1111/myc.12576 | s2cid = 23722641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple sclerosis and demyelinating disorders ===
In 1999 a randomized control trial was conducted testing a TNF-alpha inhibitor prototype, Lenercept, for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS). However, the patients in the study who received the drug had significantly more exacerbations and earlier exacerbations of their disease than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = TNF neutralization in MS: results of a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study. The Lenercept Multiple Sclerosis Study Group and The University of British Columbia MS/MRI Analysis Group | journal = Neurology | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 457–465 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10449104 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.53.3.457 | s2cid = 26126291 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Case reports have also come out suggesting the possibility that anti-TNF-alpha agents not only may worsen, but may cause new-onset Multiple Sclerosis or other [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinating disorders]] in some patients.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemanetzoglou E, Andreadou E | title = CNS Demyelination with TNF-α Blockers | journal = Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 36 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28337644 | pmc = 5364240 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-017-0742-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 case report described an Italian man with plaque psoriasis who developed MS after starting entanercept. Their literature review at that time identified 34 other cases of demyelinating disease developing after the initiation of an anti-TNF drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Napolitano M, Balato N, Ayala F, Cirillo T, Balato A | title = Multiple sclerosis following anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy for psoriasis: first case in Italy? | journal = Giornale Italiano di Dermatologia e Venereologia | volume = 153 | issue = 4 | pages = 567–572 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 25692775 | doi = 10.23736/S0392-0488.17.04992-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, anti-TNF-alpha drugs are contraindicated in patients with MS, and the American Academy of Dermatology recommends avoiding their use in those with a first degree relative with MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mansouri B, Horner ME, Menter A | title = Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Inhibitor Use in Psoriasis Patients With a First-degree Relative With Multiple Sclerosis | journal = Journal of Drugs in Dermatology | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 876–878 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26267733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The risk of anti-TNF-associated demyelination is not associated with genetic variants of multiple sclerosis. In some studies, there were clinical differences to multiple sclerosis as 70% of the patients with anti-TNF-induced demyelination. The symptoms of demyelination do not resolve with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange, and is not clear whether MS therapies are effective in anti-TNF-induced demyelination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams I, Uhlig HH | title = Demyelination After Anti-TNF Therapy: Who is at Risk? | journal = Journal of Crohn's &amp; Colitis | volume = 14 | issue = 12 | pages = 1651–1652 | date = December 2020 | pmid = 33026456 | doi = 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa144 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early experiments associated TNF with the pathogenesis of bacterial sepsis. Thus, the first preclinical studies using [[polyclonal antibodies]] against TNF-alpha were performed in animal models of sepsis in 1985 and showed that anti-TNF antibodies protected mice from sepsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vilcek J | title = First demonstration of the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of disease | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–6 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18566362 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.5 | s2cid = 44529219 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beutler B, Milsark IW, Cerami AC | title = Passive immunization against cachectin/tumor necrosis factor protects mice from lethal effect of endotoxin.

It wasn't until 1991 that studies in a transgenic mouse model of overexpressed human TNF provided the pre-clinical rationale for a causal role of TNF in the development of polyarthritis and that anti-TNF treatments could be effective against human arthritides.&lt;ref name="pmid1721867"/&gt; This was later confirmed in clinical trials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott MJ, Maini RN, Feldmann M, Kalden JR, Antoni C, Smolen JS, Leeb B, Breedveld FC, Macfarlane JD, Bijl H | display-authors = 6 | title = Randomised double-blind comparison of chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumour necrosis factor alpha (cA2) versus placebo in rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Lancet | volume = 344 | issue = 8930 | pages = 1105–1110 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7934491 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90628-9 | s2cid = 22776233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the development of the first biological therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.

'''Tokogeny''' or '''tocogeny''' is the biological relationship between parent and offspring, or more generally between ancestors and descendants.  In contradistinction to [[phylogeny]] it applies to individual [[organism]]s as opposed to [[species]].

In the tokogentic system shared characteristics are called ''traits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Species Concepts and Phylogenetic Theory: A Debate|others=Editors: Quentin Wheeler, Rudolf Meier|publisher=Columbia University Press, 2000|chapter=5: The Phylogenetic Concept (''[[sensu]]'' Wheeler and Platnick)|author=Quentin R.

'''Tonk''' is a small [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite]] that fell near [[Tonk, India]] in 1911. Despite its small size, it is often included in studies due to its compositional similarity to the early solar system.

==Composition and classification==
The meteorite consists of fragments that together weigh {{convert|7.7|g|oz|abbr=on}} and fell near the city of [[Tonk, India|Tonk]] in India near midday on 22 January 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Christie | first=W. A. K.  | year=1914 | title=The composition of the Tonk Meteorite | journal=The Journal of the Astronomical Society of India | volume=4 | number=2 | pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of five known meteorites belonging to the [[CI chondrite]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mason | first=Brian | title=The Carbonaceous Chondrites | journal=Space Science Reviews | year=1963 | volume=1 | number=4 | pages=621–646 | doi=10.1007/BF00212446 | bibcode=1963SSRv....1..621M | s2cid=121308917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This group is remarkable for having an elemental distribution that has the strongest similarity to that of the [[solar nebula]]. Except for certain volatile elements, like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and the noble gases, which are not present in the meteorite, the ratios of the elements are very similar.&lt;ref name=meteoritics&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Endress | first1=Magnus | last2=Spettel | first2=Bernhard | last3=Bischoff | first3=Adolf | year=1994 | title=Chemistry, petrography, and mineralogy of the Tonk CI chondrite: Preliminary results | journal=Meteoritics | volume=29 | number=4 | pages=462–463| bibcode=1994Metic..29..462E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably though, the meteor is highly enriched in volatile mercury which is undetectable in the solar photosphere, and this is a major driver of the "mercury paradox" that mercury abundances in meteors do not follow its volatile nature and isotopic ratios based expected behaviour in the solar nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lauretta | first1=D.S. | last2=Devouard | first2=B. | last3=Buseck | first3=P.R. | year=1999 | title=The cosmochemical behavior of mercury | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=171 | issue=1 | pages=35–47| doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(99)00129-6 | bibcode=1999E&amp;PSL.171...35L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Meier | first1=M.M.M. | last2=Cloquet | first2=C. | last3=Marty | first3=B. | year=2015 | title=Mercury (Hg) in meteorites: Variations in abundance, thermal release profile, mass-dependent and mass-independent isotopic fractionation | journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta | volume=182 | pages=55–72| doi=10.1016/j.gca.2016.03.007 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features mean that it is often, despite its small size, included in meteorological studies. The meteorite contains [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], [[magnesite]], [[magnetite]], [[pentlandite]] and [[pyrrhotite]].&lt;ref name=meteoritics/&gt;

== Etymology ==
The terms ''toponome'' and ''toponomics'' were introduced in 2003 by Walter Schubert based on observations with [[Imaging Cycler Microscopy|imaging cycler microscopes (ICM)]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

''Toponome'' derived from the ancient Greek nouns ''topos'' (τόπος, 'place, position') and '''nomos''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (νόμος, 'law'). Hence ''toponomics'' is a [[Descriptive|descriptive term]] addressing the fact that the spatial network of biomolecules in cells follows [[Topology|topological]] rules enabling coordinated actions.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

A '''tornaria''' is the planktonic [[larva]] of some species of [[Hemichordata]] such as the [[acorn worm]]s.&lt;ref name=Nakajima/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tornaria |title=tornaria |year=2015 |work=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very similar in appearance to the [[bipinnaria]] larvae of [[starfish]]es, with convoluted bands of [[cilia]] running around the body.&lt;ref name=Nakajima&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nakajima Y|author2=Humphreys T|author3=Kaneko H|author4=Tagawa K.|title=Development and neural organization of the tornaria larva of the Hawaiian hemichordate, ''Ptychodera flava''|journal=[[Zoological Science]]|date=January 2004|volume=21|issue=1|pages=69–78|pmid=14745106|doi=10.2108/0289-0003(2004)21[69:DANOOT]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is an oval shaped, transparent larva. The diameter of the body is about 3&amp;nbsp;mm. It has an apical plate, which is a thickened region provided by a tuft of cilia and a pair of eye spots. The larva has a complete alimentary canal. The ciliary band stretches throughout the anterior and posterior region, and also the postoral region.

A '''toxin''' is a [[naturally occurring]] [[organic matter|organic]] [[poison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|toxin}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[metabolic activities]] of [[Life|living]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[organism]]s.&lt;ref name="urltoxin – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toxin |title=toxin – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |access-date=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxins occur especially as a protein or conjugated protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000109718|toxin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term toxin was first used by [[organic chemist]] [[Ludwig Brieger]] (1849–1919)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWhqhK1cE-gC&amp;pg=PA6|title=Endotoxin in Health and Disease|first=Helmut|last=Brade|year=1999|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0824719449}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from the word [[toxic]].

Toxins can be [[small molecule]]s, [[peptide]]s, or [[protein]]s that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by [[Biological tissue|body tissues]] interacting with biological [[macromolecule]]s such as [[enzyme]]s or [[Receptor (biochemistry)|cellular receptors]]. Toxins vary greatly in their [[toxicity]], ranging from usually minor (such as a [[bee]] [[Stinger|sting]]) to potentially fatal even at extremely low doses (such as [[botulinum toxin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128132135/illustrated-toxicology|title=Illustrated Toxicology with Study Questions|first=PK|last=Gupta|year=2018|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-813213-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2021-06-07 |title=Diagnosis and Treatment {{!}} Botulism {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/testing-treatment.html |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=www.cdc.gov |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxins are largely [[secondary metabolites]], which are organic compounds that are not directly involved in an organism's growth, development, or reproduction, instead often aiding it in matters of defense.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}}

==Terminology==
Toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents strictly based on their biological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Are Some Fungal Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Mycotoxins?|first1= Joan W |last1= Bennett|first2= Arati A |last2=Inamdar |journal= Toxins |location= Basel |year= 2015 |volume= 7|issue= 9 | pages= 3785–3804 | doi=10.3390/toxins7093785|pmid= 26402705 |pmc= 4591661 |doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less strict understandings embrace naturally occurring non-organic toxins, such as arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Arsenic in Food: FAQ |first1=Brenda |last1=Goodman |url= https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/arsenic-food-faq | work = WebMD | access-date=20 May 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm |title=Arsenic in your food - Our findings show a real need for federal standards for this toxin |work= [[Consumer Reports]]| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Keeping arsenic out of rice |first= Carolyn |last= Beans |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year= 2021 |volume= 118 |issue= 33 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.2113071118|pmid= 34380741 |pmc= 8379988 |bibcode= 2021PNAS..11813071B |s2cid= 236989837 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other understandings embrace synthetic analogs of naturally occurring organic poisons as toxins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/178 |title=U.S. Code |access-date=20 May 2022|quote=the term "toxin" means the toxic material or product of plants, animals, microorganisms ...or a recombinant or synthesized molecule...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Module 1: Introduction to Toxicology |work=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |url = https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/es/training/toxicology_curriculum/modules/1/module-1.pdf|access-date=20 May 2022| quote= arsenic, a toxic metal, may occur as a natural contaminant ... or ... as a by-product of industrial activities.

It thus covers toxins produced biologically, as well as those produced by chemical synthesis"}}&lt;/ref&gt; embrace naturally occurring non-organic poisons. It is important to confirm usage if a common understanding is critical.

Toxins are a subset of [[toxicant]]s. The term toxicant is preferred when the poison is [[xenobiotic|man-made]] and therefore artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://askanydifference.com/difference-between-toxin-and-toxicant | title = Difference Between Toxin and Toxicant (With Table)| date = 31 October 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the human and scientific genetic assembly of a natural-based toxin should be considered a toxin as it is identical to its natural counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Genetic assembly and selective toxicity of diphtheria-toxin-related polypeptide hormone fusion proteins | year = 1987| pmid = 2847744| url = https://europepmc.org/article/med/2847744| last1 = Murphy| first1 = J.

B.| journal = Biochemical Society Symposium| volume = 53| pages = 9–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The debate is one of [[Semantics|linguistic semantics]].

The word toxin does not specify method of delivery (as opposed to [[venom]], a toxin delivered via a bite, sting, etc.). [[Poison]] is a related but broader term that encompasses both toxins and toxicants; poisons may enter the body through any means - typically inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Toxin, toxicant, and poison are often used interchangeably despite these subtle differences in definition. The term [[toxungen]] has also been proposed to refer to toxins that are delivered onto the body surface of another organism without an accompanying wound.&lt;ref name="10.1111/brv.12062"&gt;Nelsen, D. R., Nisani, Z., Cooper, A. M., Fox, G. A., Gren, E. C., Corbit, A. G., &amp; Hayes, W. K. (2014). "[http://Poisons,%20toxungens,%20and%20venoms:%20redefining%20and%20classifying%20toxic%20biological%20secretions%20and%20the%20organisms%20that%20employ%20them Poisons, toxungens, and venoms: redefining and classifying toxic biological secretions and the organisms that employ them]".

A rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable:
* [[Hemotoxin]], causes destruction of [[red blood cells]] ([[hemolysis]])
* [[Phototoxin]], causes dangerous photosensitivity
* [[Hepatotoxin]]s affect the liver
* [[Neurotoxin]]s affect the nervous system

On a broader scale, toxins may be classified as either [[exotoxin]]s, excreted by an organism, or [[endotoxin]]s, which are released mainly when bacteria are [[lysis|lysed]].

== Biotoxins ==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2021}}
The term "biotoxin" is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin as opposed to environmental or anthropogenic origins.&lt;ref name="urlbiotoxin – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biotoxin |title=biotoxin – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |access-date=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000012874|biotoxin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotoxins can be classified by their mechanism of delivery as [[poison]]s (passively transferred via ingestion, inhalation, or absorption across the skin), [[toxungen]]s (actively transferred to the target's surface by spitting, spraying, or smearing), or [[venom]]s (delivered through a wound generated by a bite, sting, or other such action).&lt;ref name="10.1111/brv.12062"/&gt; They can also be classified by their source, such as [[mycotoxin|fungal biotoxins]], [[microbial toxin]]s, [[phytotoxin|plant biotoxins]], or animal biotoxins.

Toxins produced by [[microorganism]]s are important [[virulence]] determinants responsible for microbial [[pathogenicity]] and/or evasion of the host [[immune response]].&lt;ref name= ProftT&gt;{{cite book |veditors = Proft T | year=2009 |title=Microbial Toxins: Current Research and Future Trends | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-44-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism, and can be highly complex (the [[venom]] of the [[cone snail]] can contain over 100 unique [[peptide]]s, which target specific nerve channels or receptors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=Samuel D |last2=Norton |first2=Raymond S |title=Conotoxin Gene Superfamilies |journal = Marine Drugs |volume = 12 |issue = 12 |pages = 6058–6101 |date = 17 December 2014 | doi = 10.3390/md12126058 |pmid = 25522317 | pmc = 4278219|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotoxins in nature have two primary functions:
* [[Predation]], such as in the [[spider]], [[snake]], [[scorpion]], [[jellyfish]], and [[wasp]]
* Defense as in the [[bee]], [[ant]], [[termite]], [[honey bee]], [[wasp]],  [[poison dart frog]] and [[Phytotoxin#Toxins_produced_by_plants|plants producing toxins]]

Some of the more well known types of biotoxins include:
* [[Cyanotoxin]]s, produced by [[cyanobacteria]]
* [[Dinotoxin]]s, produced by [[dinoflagellate]]s
* Necrotoxins cause [[necrosis]] (i.e., death) in the cells they encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary]] |date=2012 |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8 |page=1236 |edition=32nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necrotoxins spread through the bloodstream.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In humans, [[skin]] and [[muscle]] tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxins.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Organisms that possess necrotoxins include:
** The [[brown recluse spider|brown recluse]] or "fiddle back" spider
** Most [[rattlesnake]]s and [[vipers]] produce [[phospholipase]] and various [[trypsin]]-like [[serine proteases]]
** [[Bitis arietans|Puff adder]]
** [[Necrotizing fasciitis]] (caused by the "flesh eating" bacterium ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'') – produces a [[pore-forming toxin|pore forming toxin]]
* [[Neurotoxin]]s primarily affect the nervous systems of animals. The group neurotoxins generally consists of [[:Category:Ion channel toxins|ion channel toxins]] that disrupt ion channel conductance. Organisms that possess neurotoxins include:
** The [[Latrodectus|black widow]] spider.
** Most [[scorpion]]s
** The [[box jellyfish]]
** [[Elapidae|Elapid]] snakes
** The [[cone snail]]
** The [[Blue-ringed octopus]]
** [[Venomous fish]]
** [[Frogs]]
** ''[[Palythoa]]'' [[coral]]
** Various different types of [[algae]], [[cyanobacteria]] and [[dinoflagellates]]
* [[Myotoxin]]s are small, basic [[peptide]]s found in [[snake]] and [[lizard]] [[Venom (poison)|venoms]], They cause muscle tissue damage by a non-enzymatic receptor based mechanism. Organisms that possess myotoxins include:
** [[rattlesnake]]s
** [[Mexican beaded lizard]]
* [[Cytotoxicity|Cytotoxins]] are toxic at the level of individual cells, either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells:
** [[Ricin]], from [[castor bean]]s
** [[Apitoxin]], from [[honey bee]]s
** [[T-2 mycotoxin]], from certain toxic [[mushroom]]s
** [[Cardiotoxin III]], from [[Chinese cobra]]
** [[Hemotoxin]], from [[viper]]s

=== Biotoxins as Bioweapons ===
Many living organisms employ toxins offensively or defensively. A relatively small number of toxins are known to have the potential to cause widespread sickness or casualties, but these may be appealing to those who would use them nefariously for several reasons. They are often inexpensive and easily available, and in some cases it is possible to refine them outside the laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Janik |first1=Edyta |last2=Ceremuga |first2=Michal |last3=Saluk-Bijak |first3=Joanna |last4=Bijak |first4=Michal |date=2019-03-08 |title=Biological Toxins as the Potential Tools for Bioterrorism |journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=1181 |doi=10.3390/ijms20051181 |issn=1422-0067 |pmc=6429496 |pmid=30857127|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As biotoxins act quickly, and are highly toxic even at low doses, they can be more efficient than chemical agents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
Due to these factors, it is vital to raise awareness of the clinical symptoms of biotoxin poisoning, and to develop effective countermeasures including rapid investigation, response, and treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Editorial |first=Team |title=Toxins: Venom within Living Cells or Organisms |url=https://www.unrevealedfiles.com/toxins-venom-within-living-cells-or-organisms/ |access-date=2021-07-17 |website=Unrevealed Files |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Płusa|first=Tadeusz|date=September 2015|title=[Toxins as a biological weapon]|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26449572/#:~:text=Toxins%20list%20is%20extensive,%20but,include%20tetrodotoxin,%20brevetoxin%20and%20saxitoxin.|journal=Polski Merkuriusz Lekarski|volume=39|issue=231|pages=131–133|issn=1426-9686|pmid=26449572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Environmental toxins==
{{See also|Environmental toxicology}}
The term "environmental toxin" can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants&lt;ref name="pmid14977703"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grigg J | title = Environmental toxins; their impact on children's health | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–50 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14977703 | pmc = 1719840 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2002.022202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as industrial [[pollutant]]s and other artificially made [[Toxicity|toxic]] substances. As this contradicts most formal definitions of the term "toxin", it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts.

Environmental toxins from [[food chain]]s that may be dangerous to human health include:

==Finding information about toxins==
In general, when scientists determine the amount of a substance that may be hazardous for humans, animals and/or the environment they determine the amount of the substance likely to trigger effects and if possible establish a safe level. In Europe, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] produced risk assessments for more than 4,000 substances in over 1,600 scientific opinions and they provide open access summaries of human health, animal health and ecological hazard assessments in their OpenFoodTox&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/data/chemical-hazards-data|title=Chemical hazards data - OpenFoodTox|website=European Food Safety Authority|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorne JL, Richardson J, Kass G, Georgiadis N, Monguidi M, Pasinato L, Cappe S, Verhagen H, Robinson T | title = OpenFoodTox: EFSA's open source toxicological database on chemical hazards in food and feed. | journal = EFSA Journal | date = January 2017 | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = e15011 | doi = 10.2903/j.efsa.2017.e15011 | pmid = 32625280 | pmc = 7009813 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid31325634"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reilly L, Serafimova R, Partosch F, Gundert-Remy U, Cortiñas Abrahantes J, Dorne JM, Kass GE | title = Testing the thresholds of toxicological concern values using a new database for food-related substances | journal = Toxicology Letters | volume = 314 | pages = 117–123 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31325634 | doi = 10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.07.019 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OpenFoodTox database can be used to screen potential new foods for toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearce JM, Khaksari M, Denkenberger D | title = Preliminary Automated Determination of Edibility of Alternative Foods: Non-Targeted Screening for Toxins in Red Maple Leaf Concentrate | journal = Plants | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 110 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 31027336 | pmc = 6571818 | doi = 10.3390/plants8050110 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misuse of the term==
In the context of [[quackery]] and [[alternative medicine]], the term "toxin" is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health. This could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous [[pesticide]]s, to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation ([[Colon cleansing|auto-intoxication]]), to food ingredients such as [[White sugar|table sugar]], [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), and [[aspartame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/detox_overview.html | title = "Detoxification" Schemes and Scams | date = 8 June 2011 | publisher = [[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ''detoxification'' or ''detox'' as justification for treatments such as [[infrared sauna]]s, diets,{{R|Diet}} or [[chiropractic]] treatments{{R|Chiro}}, is often called the ''toxin gambit'', referring to a marketing technique which can frighten the public into seeking treatments that claim to remove unspecified toxins.{{R|Novella1}} These claims can be harmful financially and physically. Healthy [[kidney]]s and [[liver]] are all that most people need to remove almost anything potentially toxic that would be ingested.{{R|Novella}}

      <text bytes="12737" xml:space="preserve">[[Trace fossil]]s are [[Biological classification|classified]] in various ways for different purposes. Traces can be classified [[#Taxonomic classification|taxonomically]] (by morphology), [[#Ethologic classification|ethologically]] (by behavior), and [[#Toponomic classification|toponomically]], that is, according to their relationship to the surrounding sedimentary layers. Except in the rare cases where the original maker of a trace fossil can be identified with confidence, phylogenetic classification of trace fossils is an unreasonable proposition.

==Taxonomic classification== &lt;!--intro links here--&gt;
The '''taxonomic classification of trace fossils''' parallels the taxonomic classification of [[organism]]s under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. In [[trace fossil]] nomenclature a [[Latin]] [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] is used, just as in [[animal]] and [[plant]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], with a [[genus]] and [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]]. However, the binomial names are not linked to an organism, but rather just a trace fossil. This is due to the rarity of association between a trace fossil and a specific organism or group of organisms. Trace fossils are therefore included in an ''[[ichnotaxon]]'' separate from [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. When referring to trace fossils, the terms ''ichnogenus'' and ''ichnospecies'' parallel genus and [[species]] respectively.

The most promising cases of phylogenetic classification are those in which similar trace fossils show details complex enough to deduce the makers, such as [[bryozoan]] [[bioerosion|borings]], large [[trilobite]] trace fossils such as ''[[Cruziana]]'', and [[vertebrate]] [[footprints]]. However, most trace fossils lack sufficiently complex details to allow such classification.

==Ethologic classification==

===The Seilacherian System===
[[File:BoredEncrustedShell.JPG|thumb|Sponge borings (''[[Entobia]]'') and encrusters on a modern bivalve shell, North Carolina; an example of ''Domichnia''.]]
[[Adolf Seilacher]] was the first to propose a broadly accepted [[ethology|ethological]] basis for trace fossil classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1953 |title=Studien zur Paläontologie: 1. Über die Methoden der Palichnologie |journal=Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie |series=Abhandlungen |volume=96 |pages=421–452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1964 |title=Sedimentological classification and nomenclature of trace fossils |journal=Sedimentology |volume=3 |pages=253–256 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1964.tb00464.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized that most trace fossils are created by [[animal]]s in one of five main behavioural activities, and named them accordingly:

* '''''Cubichnia''''' are the traces of organisms left on the surface of a soft [[sediment]]. This behaviour may simply be resting as in the case of a [[starfish]], but might also evidence the hiding place of [[prey]], or even the ambush position of a [[predator]].
* '''''Domichnia''''' are dwelling structures that reflect the life positions of organisms, for example the [[burrow]]s or [[bioerosion|borings]] of [[suspension feeder]]s, and are perhaps the most common of the established ethological classes.
* ''[[Fodinichnia]]'' are feeding traces which are formed as a result of organisms disturbing the sediment in their search for food. They are normally created by [[deposit feeder]]s as they tunnel through soft sediments, usually producing a 3D structure.
* '''''Pascichnia''''' are a different type of feeding trace for which the trophic guild responsible are [[grazing|grazer]]s. They create 2D features as they scour the surface of a hard or soft [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] in order to obtain [[nutriment]].
* '''''Repichnia''''' are locomotory tracks that show evidence of organisms moving from one station to another, usually in a near-straight to slightly curved line. Most of the very few traces to be verifiably assigned to a specific organism are in this category, such as various [[arthropod]] and [[vertebrate]] trackways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1967 |title=Bathymetry of trace fossils |journal=Marine Geology |volume=5 |issue= 5–6|pages=413–428 |doi=10.1016/0025-3227(67)90051-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of behavioural categorization, several other ethological classes have been suggested and accepted, as follows:

* ''Aedificichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bown |first1=T. M. |last2=Ratcliffe |first2=B. C. |year=1988 |title=The origin of ''Chubutolithes'' Ihering, ichnofossils from the Eocene and Oligocene of Chubut province, Argentina |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=163–167 |doi=10.1017/S0022336000029802 |s2cid=20261299 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&amp;context=entomologypapers }}&lt;/ref&gt; evidence of organisms building structures outside of the [[infauna]]l realm, such as [[termite]] mounds or [[wasp]] nests.
* ''Agrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA; Bromley, RG; Pemberton, SG (1984) Ichnology: Trace fossils in sedimentology and stratigraphy. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists Short Course, no 15, 317 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; so called "gardening traces", which are systematic burrow networks designed to capture migrating [[meiofauna]] or perhaps even to culture [[bacteria]]. The organism would have continually inspected this burrow system to prey on any smaller organisms that strayed into it.
* ''Calichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Genise, JF &amp; Bown, TM (1991) New Miocene scarabaeid and hymenopterous nests and Early Miocene (Santacrucian) palaeoenvironments, Patagonian Argentina. Ichnos, 3: 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt; structures that were created by organisms specifically for [[Reproduction|breeding]] purposes, e.g. [[bee]] cells.
* ''Equilibrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, RG (1990) Trace fossils: biology and taphonomy. Unwin Hyman Ltd, London, 280 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; burrows within the sediment that show evidence for organisms' responses to variations in sedimentation rate (i.e. the burrow moves upwards to avoid burial, or downwards to avoid exposure). Typically this evidence will be in the form of [[spreiten]], which are small laminations in the sediment that reflect previous positions the organisms were in.
* ''[[Fugichnia]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1975) The morphological classification of trace fossils. In Frey, RW (ed.) The study of trace fossils. New York, Springer-Verlag, pp 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt; "escape traces" that are formed as a result of organisms' attempts to escape burial in sudden high-sedimentation events like [[turbidity current]]s. The burrows are often marked with chevron patterns showing the upward direction the organisms were tunnelling.
* ''Praedichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA (1985) Palaeoecology of the marine endobenthos. Palaeogeography, Palaeoecology, Palaeoclimatology 50: 63-81.&lt;/ref&gt; trace fossils that show evidence of [[predator]]y behaviour, such as the drill holes ([[bioerosion|borings]]) left in [[Animal shell|shell]]s by [[carnivorous]] [[gastropod]]s, or more dramatically, the bite marks found on some [[vertebrate]] [[bone]]s.

Over the years several other behavioural groups have been proposed, but in general they have been quickly discarded by the ichnological community. Some of the failed proposals are listed below, with a brief description.

* ''Chemichnia'': a type of agrichnia applied specifically to those instances of [[bacteria]]l harvesting.
* ''Cecidoichnia'': a plant trace in which a gall is left on the plant as a result of interaction with animals, bacteria, or other plants.
* ''Corrosichnia'': traces that are left by plant [[root]]s as a result of their [[corrosive]] action on the sediments.
* ''Cursichnia'': a subgroup of the repichnia, created by a crawling or walking habit.
* ''Fixichnia'': traces left by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms that anchored themselves to a hard substrate.
* ''Mordichnia'': a praedichnial subgroup that shows evidence of the prey's death as a result of the attack.
* ''Natichnia'': a type of repichnia caused by disturbances to a soft sediment by a swimming organism, e.g. a [[benthic]] [[fish]].
* ''Polychresichnia'': traces that show an origin in the combination of two or more established trace-producing behaviours, e.g. domichnia that served as the feeding position of the organisms.
* ''Sphenoichnia'': a plant trace created by the [[bioturbation]]al action of roots.
* ''Taphichnia'': fugichnia in which the organism failed to escape and was buried, often resulting in its body fossil being found in association with the trace.
* ''Volichnia'': traces that show the position a flying organism (usually an insect) landed on a soft sediment.

Fixichnia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibert |first1=J. M. de |last2=Domènech |first2=R. |last3=Martinell |first3=J. |year=2004 |title=An ethological framework for animal bioerosion trace fossils upon mineral substrates with proposal of new class, fixichnia |journal=Lethaia |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=429–437 |doi=10.1080/00241160410002144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the group with the most weight as a candidate for the next accepted ethological class, being not fully described by any of the eleven currently accepted categories. There is also potential for the three plant traces (cecidoichnia, corrosichnia and sphenoichnia) to gain recognition in coming years, with little attention having been paid to them since their proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mikuláš |first=R. |year=1999 |title=Notes on the concept of plant trace fossils related to plant-generated sedimentary structures |journal=Věštník Českého Geologického ústavu |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=39–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponomic classification==

Another way to classify trace fossils is to look at their relation to the [[sediment]] of origin. Martinsson&lt;ref&gt;Martinsson, A (1970) Toponomy of trace fossils. In Crimes, TP &amp; Harper, JC (eds.) (1970) Trace fossils. Geological Journal, Special Issue 3: 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided the most widely accepted of such systems, identifying four distinct classes for traces to be separated in this regard:

* ''Endichnia'' are those traces that are found wholly within the casting medium, and therefore can only have been made by an infaunal organism.
* ''Epichnia'' are found on the tops of the strata of origin, being those ridges and grooves that were formed by benthic organisms or infaunal burrows that have been exposed by [[erosion]].
* ''Exichnia'' are traces that are made of material that is different from the surrounding medium, having either been actively filled by an organism or eroded out and re-covered by an alien sediment.
* ''Hypichnia'' are ridges and grooves found on the soles of the beds of origin at their interfaces with other [[stratum|strata]], representing the opposite of epichnia.

Other classifications have been proposed,&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, CK (1971) Morphology and ethology of trace fossils from the Ouachita Mountains, southeast Oklahoma. Journal of Paleontology, 45: 212-246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1957) On the trace fossil ''Chondrites''. Quarterly Journal, Geological Society of London 112: 475-99.&lt;/ref&gt; but none stray far from the above.

==History==

Early paleontologists originally classified many burrow fossils as the remains of marine [[algae]], as is apparent in ichnogenera named with the ''-phycus'' suffix. [[Alfred Gabriel Nathorst]] and Joseph F. James both controversially challenged this incorrect classification, suggesting the reinterpretation of many "algae" as marine invertebrate trace fossils.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9780813730271|title= Miscellanea: Supplement 1, Trace Fossils and Problematica | last1= Häntzschel | first1= Walter |authorlink=Walter Häntzschel |editor1-last = Moore | editor1-first= Raymond C. | year=  1975  | publisher= Geological Society of America | series= Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts to classify trace fossils have been made throughout the history of paleontology. In 1844, [[Edward Hitchcock]] proposed two [[order (biology)|orders]]: ''Apodichnites'', including footless trails, and ''Polypodichnites'', including trails of organisms with more than four feet.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1" /&gt;

'''Trajectory inference''' or '''pseudotemporal ordering''' is a computational technique used in [[single-cell transcriptomics]] to determine the pattern of a dynamic process experienced by cells and then arrange cells based on their progression through the process. Single-cell protocols have much higher levels of noise than bulk [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]],&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bacher|first1=Rhonda|last2=Kendziorski|first2=Christina|author2-link= Christina Kendziorski |date=2016-04-07|title=Design and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments|journal=Genome Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=63|doi=10.1186/s13059-016-0927-y|issn=1474-760X|pmc=4823857|pmid=27052890}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a common step in a single-cell transcriptomics workflow is the [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] of cells into subgroups.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Byungjin|last2=Lee|first2=Ji Hyun|last3=Bang|first3=Duhee|title=Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines|journal=Experimental &amp; Molecular Medicine|language=En|volume=50|issue=8|pages=1–14|doi=10.1038/s12276-018-0071-8|pmid=30089861|pmc=6082860|issn=2092-6413|date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clustering can contend with this inherent variation by combining the signal from many cells, while allowing for the identification of cell types.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Stegle|first1=Oliver|last2=Teichmann|first2=Sarah A.|last3=Marioni|first3=John C.|date=2015-01-28|title=Computational and analytical challenges in single-cell transcriptomics|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=En|volume=16|issue=3|pages=133–145|doi=10.1038/nrg3833|pmid=25628217|s2cid=205486032|issn=1471-0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some differences in [[gene expression]] between cells are the result of dynamic processes such as the [[cell cycle]], [[Cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]], or response to an external stimuli.

__TOC__

== Methods ==
Since 2015, more than 50 algorithms for trajectory inference have been created.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Saelens|first1=Wouter|last2=Cannoodt|first2=Robrecht|last3=Todorov|first3=Helena|last4=Saeys|first4=Yvan|date=2019-01-04|title=A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0071-9|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|pages=547–555|doi=10.1038/s41587-019-0071-9|volume=37|issue=5|pmid=30936559|s2cid=89616753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the approaches taken are diverse there are some commonalities to the methods. Typically, the steps in the algorithm consist of [[dimensionality reduction]] to reduce the complexity of the data, trajectory building to determine the structure of the dynamic process, and projection of the data onto the trajectory so that cells are positioned by their evolution through the process and cells with similar expression profiles are situated near each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Trajectory inference algorithms differ in the specific procedure used for dimensionality reduction, the kinds of structures that can be used to represent the dynamic process, and the prior information that is required or can be provided.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
[[File:GaussianScatterPCA.svg|thumb|PCA of a [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]]. The vectors shown are the first (longer vector) and second principal components, which indicate the directions of maximum variance.]]

=== Dimensionality Reduction ===
The data produced by single-cell RNA-seq can consist of thousands of cells each with expression levels recorded across thousands of genes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Conesa|first1=Ana|last2=Madrigal|first2=Pedro|last3=Tarazona|first3=Sonia|last4=Gomez-Cabrero|first4=David|last5=Cervera|first5=Alejandra|last6=McPherson|first6=Andrew|last7=Szcześniak|first7=Michał Wojciech|last8=Gaffney|first8=Daniel J.|last9=Elo|first9=Laura L.|date=2016-01-26|title=A survey of best practices for RNA-seq data analysis|journal=Genome Biology|language=En|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13|doi=10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8|issn=1474-760X|pmc=4728800|pmid=26813401}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to efficiently process data with such high dimensionality many trajectory inference algorithms employ a dimensionality reduction procedure such as [[principal component analysis]] (PCA), [[independent component analysis]] (ICA), or [[T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding|t-SNE]] as their first step.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yosef|first1=Nir|last2=Regev|first2=Aviv|last3=Wagner|first3=Allon|title=Revealing the vectors of cellular identity with single-cell genomics|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1145–1160|doi=10.1038/nbt.3711|pmid=27824854|pmc=5465644|issn=1546-1696|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this step is to combine many features of the data into a more informative measure of the data.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, a coordinate resulting from dimensionality reduction could combine expression levels from many genes that are associated with the cell cycle into one value that represents a cell's position in the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Such a transformation corresponds to dimensionality reduction in the feature space, but dimensionality reduction can also be applied to the sample space by clustering together groups of similar cells.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Trajectory Building ===
[[File:6n-graf.svg|thumb|A graph with six vertices. Many trajectory inference algorithms use graphs to build the trajectory. ]]
Many methods represent the structure of the dynamic process via a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]-based approach. In such an approach the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the graph correspond to states in the dynamic process, such as cell types in cell differentiation, and the [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] between the nodes correspond to transitions between the states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The creation of the trajectory graph can be accomplished using [[K-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbors]] or [[minimum spanning tree]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cahan|first1=Patrick|last2=Tan|first2=Yuqi|last3=Kumar|first3=Pavithra|date=2017-01-01|title=Understanding development and stem cells using single cell-based analyses of gene expression|journal=Development|language=en|volume=144|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1242/dev.133058|issn=1477-9129|pmid=28049689|pmc=5278625}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topology of the trajectory refers to the structure of the graph and different algorithms are limited to creation of graph topologies of a particular type such as [[Path graph|linear]], [[Tree (graph theory)|branching]], or [[Cyclic graph|cyclic]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Use of prior information ===
Some methods require or allow for the input of prior information which is used to guide the creation of the trajectory. The use of prior information can lead to more accurate trajectory determination, but poor priors can lead the algorithm astray or bias results towards expectations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of prior information that can be used in trajectory inference are the selection of start cells that are at the beginning of the trajectory, the number of branches in the trajectory, and the number of end states for the trajectory.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Software ==

=== MARGARET ===
MARGARET employs a deep unsupervised [[Similarity learning|metric learning]] approach for inferring the cellular latent space and cell clusters. The trajectory is modeled using a cluster-connectivity graph to capture complex trajectory topologies. MARGARET utilizes the inferred trajectory for determining terminal states and inferring [[Adult stem cell|cell-fate plasticity]] using a scalable [[Absorbing Markov chain]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pandey|first1=Kushagra|last2=Zafar|first2=Hamim|date=2022|title=Inference of cell state transitions and cell fate plasticity from single-cell with MARGARET|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|doi=10.1093/nar/gkac412|issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monocle ===
Monocle first employs a differential expression test to reduce the number of genes then applies [[independent component analysis]] for additional dimensionality reduction. To build the trajectory Monocle computes a [[minimum spanning tree]], then finds the longest [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected path]] in that tree. Cells are projected onto the nearest point to them along that path.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== p-Creode ===
p-Creode finds the most likely path through a density-adjusted [[Nearest neighbor graph|k-nearest neighbor graph]]. Graphs from an ensemble are scored with a graph similarity metric to select the most representative topology.  p-Creode has been tested on a range of single-cell platforms, including [[mass cytometry]], multiplex immunofluorescence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gerdes|first1=M.

=== Slingshot ===
Slingshot takes cluster labels as input and then orders these clusters into lineages by the construction of a [[minimum spanning tree]]. Paths through the tree are smoothed by fitting simultaneous principal curves and a cell's pseudotime value is determined by its projection onto one or more of these curves. Prior information, such as initial and terminal clusters, is optional.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Street|first1=Kelly|last2=Risso|first2=Davide|last3=Fletcher|first3=Russell B.|last4=Das|first4=Diya|last5=Ngai|first5=John|last6=Yosef|first6=Nir|last7=Purdom|first7=Elizabeth|last8=Dudoit|first8=Sandrine|author8-link=Sandrine Dudoit|date=2018-06-19|title=Slingshot: cell lineage and pseudotime inference for single-cell transcriptomics|journal=BMC Genomics|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=477|doi=10.1186/s12864-018-4772-0|pmc=6007078|pmid=29914354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TSCAN ===
TSCAN performs dimensionality reduction using [[principal component analysis]] and clusters cells using a [[mixture model]]. A [[minimum spanning tree]] is calculated using the centers of the clusters and the trajectory is determined as the longest [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected path]] of that tree. TSCAN is an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] algorithm that requires no prior information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ji|first1=Zhicheng|last2=Ji|first2=Hongkai|date=2016-05-13|title=TSCAN: Pseudo-time reconstruction and evaluation in single-cell RNA-seq analysis|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=13|pages=e117|doi=10.1093/nar/gkw430|pmid=27179027|pmc=4994863|issn=0305-1048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wanderlust/Wishbone ===
Wanderlust was developed for analysis of [[mass cytometry]] data, but has been adapted for [[single-cell transcriptomics]] applications. A [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm]] is used to construct a graph which connects every cell to the cell closest to it with respect to a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] such as [[Euclidean distance]] or [[cosine distance]]. Wanderlust requires the input of a starting cell as prior information.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-04-24|title=Single-Cell Trajectory Detection Uncovers Progression and Regulatory Coordination in Human B Cell Development|journal=Cell|language=en|volume=157|issue=3|pages=714–725|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.04.005|pmid=24766814|pmc=4045247|issn=0092-8674|last1=Bendall|first1=Sean C.|last2=Davis|first2=Kara L.|last3=Amir|first3=El-ad David|last4=Tadmor|first4=Michelle D.|last5=Simonds|first5=Erin F.|last6=Chen|first6=Tiffany J.|last7=Shenfeld|first7=Daniel K.|last8=Nolan|first8=Garry P.|last9=Pe'Er|first9=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wishbone is built on Wanderlust and allows for a bifurcation in the graph topology, whereas Wanderlust creates a [[Path graph|linear graph]]. Wishbone combines principal component analysis and [[diffusion maps]] to achieve dimensionality reduction then also creates a [[K-nearest neighbors algorithm|KNN]] graph.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Setty|first1=Manu|last2=Tadmor|first2=Michelle D|last3=Reich-Zeliger|first3=Shlomit|last4=Angel|first4=Omer|last5=Salame|first5=Tomer Meir|last6=Kathail|first6=Pooja|last7=Choi|first7=Kristy|last8=Bendall|first8=Sean|last9=Friedman|first9=Nir|date=2016-05-02|title=Wishbone identifies bifurcating developmental trajectories from single-cell data|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=34|issue=6|pages=637–645|doi=10.1038/nbt.3569|pmid=27136076|pmc=4900897|issn=1087-0156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waterfall ===
Waterfall performs dimensionality reduction via [[principal component analysis]] and uses a [[K-means clustering|k-means algorithm]] to find cell clusters. A [[minimal spanning tree]] is built between the centers of the clusters. Waterfall is entirely unsupervised, requiring no prior information, and produces [[Linear graph|linear]] trajectories.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-09-03|title=Single-Cell RNA-Seq with Waterfall Reveals Molecular Cascades underlying Adult Neurogenesis|journal=Cell Stem Cell|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=360–372|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2015.07.013|pmid=26299571|issn=1934-5909|last1=Shin|first1=Jaehoon|last2=Berg|first2=Daniel A.|last3=Zhu|first3=Yunhua|last4=Shin|first4=Joseph Y.|last5=Song|first5=Juan|last6=Bonaguidi|first6=Michael A.|last7=Enikolopov|first7=Grigori|last8=Nauen|first8=David W.|last9=Christian|first9=Kimberly M.|last10=Ming|first10=Guo-li|last11=Song|first11=Hongjun|pmc=8638014|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transcellular transport''' involves the transportation of [[solutes]] by a [[cell (biology)|cell]] ''through'' a cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhoades|first1=Rodney A.|last2=Bell|first2=David R.|title=Medical physiology : principles for clinical medicine|date=2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1451110395|page=[https://archive.org/details/medicalphysiolog0000unse_a2j7/page/36 36]|edition=4th ed., International|chapter=Plasma membrane. membrane transport, and resting membrane potential|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/medicalphysiolog0000unse_a2j7/page/36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcellular transport can occur in three different ways active transport, passive transport, and transcytosis. 

== Active Transport ==
Main article: [[Active transport]]

Active transport is the process of moving [[Molecule|molecules]] from an area of low [[Concentration|concentrations]] to an area of high concentration. There are two types of active transport, [[primary active transport]] and [[secondary active transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hendrickson|first1=W. A.|last2=Ward|first2=K. B.|date=1975-10-27|title=Atomic models for the polypeptide backbones of myohemerythrin and hemerythrin|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5/|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1349–1356|doi=10.1016/0006-291x(75)90508-2|issn=1090-2104|pmid=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary active transport uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to move specific molecules and solutes against its concentration gradient. Examples of molecules that follow this process are [[potassium]] K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[sodium]] Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[calcium]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. A place in the human body where this occurs is in the intestines with the uptake of [[glucose]]. Secondary active transport is when one solute moves down the [[electrochemical gradient]] to produce enough energy to force the transport of another solute from low concentration to high concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Primary Active Transport - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/primary-active-transport|access-date=2021-11-29|website=www.sciencedirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of where this occurs is in the movement of glucose within the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT).

== Passive Transport ==
Main article: [[Passive transport]]

Passive transport is the process of moving molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration without expelling any energy. There are two types of passive transport, passive diffusion and [[facilitated diffusion]]. Passive diffusion is the unassisted movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration across a [[Semipermeable membrane|permeable membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-07-10|title=5.2A: The Role of Passive Transport|url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_General_Biology_(Boundless)/5%3A_Structure_and_Function_of_Plasma_Membranes/5.2%3A_Passive_Transport/5.2A%3A_The_Role_of_Passive_Transport|access-date=2021-11-29|website=Biology LibreTexts|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of passive diffusion is the [[gas exchange]] that occurs between the [[oxygen]] in the [[blood]] and the [[carbon dioxide]] present in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Peter D.|date=2015-01-01|title=The physiological basis of pulmonary gas exchange: implications for clinical interpretation of arterial blood gases|url=https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/45/1/227|journal=European Respiratory Journal|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=227–243|doi=10.1183/09031936.00039214|issn=0903-1936|pmid=25323225|s2cid=14808756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilitated diffusion is the movement of polar molecules down the concentration gradient with the assistance of [[Membrane protein|membrane proteins]]. Since the molecules associated with facilitated diffusion are polar, they are repelled by the hydrophobic sections of permeable membrane, therefore they need to be assisted by the membrane proteins. Both types of passive transport will continue until the system reaches [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=5.2 Passive Transport - Biology 2e {{!}} OpenStax|url=https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/5-2-passive-transport|access-date=2021-11-29|website=openstax.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of facilitated diffusion is the movement glucose from small intestine [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells into the [[extracellular matrix]] of the blood capillaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Lihong|last2=Tuo|first2=Biguang|last3=Dong|first3=Hui|date=2016-01-14|title=Regulation of Intestinal Glucose Absorption by Ion Channels and Transporters|journal=Nutrients|volume=8|issue=1|pages=43|doi=10.3390/nu8010043|issn=2072-6643|pmc=4728656|pmid=26784222|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcytosis ==
Main article: [[Transcytosis]]

Transcytosis is the movement of large molecules across the interior of a cell. This process occurs by engulfing the molecule as it moves across the interior of the cell and then releasing the molecule on the other side. There are two types of transcytosis are receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) and adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT). An example where both types of transcytosis occur is the movement of macromolecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Transcytosis - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/transcytosis|access-date=2021-11-29|website=www.sciencedirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paracellular Transport ==
In contrast, [[paracellular transport]] is the transfer of substances across an epithelium by passing through an intercellular space between the cells.
*1. It differs from transcellular transport, where the substances travel through the cell passing through both the apical membrane and basolateral membrane
*2. [[Renal physiology]]. Transcellular transport is more likely to involve energy expenditure than paracellular transport.
*3. [[Capillaries]] of the [[blood–brain barrier]] have only transcellular transport, in contrast with normal capillaries, which have both transcellular and paracellular transport.

==Discovery==
Davis et al. 1987 reported the first instance (sight) of transdifferentiation where a cell changed from one adult cell type to another. Forcing mouse embryonic [[fibroblast]]s to express [[MyoD]] was found to be [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] to turn those cells into [[myoblast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Natural examples==

The only known instances where adult cells change directly from one lineage to another occurs in the species ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii#Biological immortality|Turritopsis dohrnii]] (''which is also known as the immortal jellyfish) and ''[[Turritopsis nutricula|Turritopsis Nutricula]]'' (the [[Protozoa|protozoan]] which makes the immortal jellyfish immortal). Rather, cells dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate into the cell type of interest. In [[newt]]s when the eye lens is removed, pigmented [[epithelial]] cells de-differentiate and then redifferentiate into the lens cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Induced and therapeutic examples==

The first example of functional transdifferentiation has been provided by Ferber et al.&lt;ref&gt;Ferber S, Halkin A, Cohen H, Ber I, Einav Y, Goldberg I, Barshack I, Seijffers R, Kopolovic J, Kaiser N, Karasik A (2000) Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 induces expression of insulin genes in liver and ameliorates streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia. http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v6/n5/full/nm0500_568.html&lt;/ref&gt; by inducing a shift in the developmental fate of cells in the liver and converting them into '[[Pancreas|pancreatic]] [[Beta cell|beta-cell]]-like' cells. The cells induced a wide, functional and long-lasting transdifferentiation process that reduced the effects of [[hyperglycemia]] in diabetic mice.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;Sarah Ferber, Amir Halkin, Hofit Cohen, Idit Ber, Yulia Einav, Iris Goldberg, Iris Barshack, Rhona Seijffers, Juri Kopolovic, Nurit Kaiser &amp; Avraham Karasik (2000) - "[http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v6/n5/full/nm0500_568.html Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 induces expression of insulin genes in liver and ameliorates streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia]"&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the trans-differentiated beta-like cells were found to be resistant to the [[autoimmune]] attack that characterizes [[type 1 diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;Shternhall-Ron K et al., Ectopic PDX-1 expression in liver ameliorates type 1 diabetes, Journal of Autoimmunity (2007),
doi:10.1016/j.jaut.2007.02.010. http://www.orgenesis.com/uploads/default/files/shternhall-jai-2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The second step was to undergo transdifferentiation in human specimens. By transducing liver cells with a single gene, Sapir et al. were able to induce human liver cells to transdifferentiate into human beta cells.&lt;ref name="pnas.org"&gt;Tamar Sapir, Keren Shternhall, Irit Meivar-Levy, Tamar Blumenfeld, Hamutal Cohen, Ehud Skutelsky, Smadar Eventov-Friedman, Iris Barshack, Iris Goldberg, Sarah Pri-Chen, Lya Ben-Dor, Sylvie Polak-Charcon, Avraham Karasik, Ilan Shimon, Eytan Mor, and Sarah Ferber (2005) [http://www.pnas.org/content/102/22/7964 Cell-replacement therapy for diabetes: Generating functional insulin-producing tissue from adult human liver cells]&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has been demonstrated in mice, rat, [[xenopus]] and human tissues (Al-Hasani et al., 2013).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Schematic model of the [[hepatocyte]]-to-beta cell transdifferentiation process. Hepatocytes are obtained by liver biopsy from diabetic patient, cultured and expanded [[ex vivo]], transduced with a [[PDX1]] virus, transdifferentiated into functional [[insulin]]-producing beta cells, and transplanted back into the patient.&lt;ref name="pnas.org"/&gt;

==Methods==

=== Lineage-instructive approach ===

=== Mogrify algorithm ===
Determining the unique set of cellular factors that is needed to be manipulated for each cell conversion is a long and costly process that involved much trial and error. As a result, this first step of identifying the key set of cellular factors for cell conversion is the major obstacle researchers face in the field of cell reprogramming. An international team of researchers have developed an algorithm, called Mogrify(1), that can predict the optimal set of cellular factors required to convert one human cell type to another. When tested, Mogrify was able to accurately predict the set of cellular factors required for previously published cell conversions correctly. To further validate Mogrify's predictive ability, the team conducted two novel cell conversions in the laboratory using human cells, and these were successful in both attempts solely using the predictions of Mogrify.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-01/dms-moc011516.php  Mapping out cell conversion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = Rackham | last2 = Gough | first2 = Julian  | year = 2016 | title = A predictive computational framework for direct reprogramming between human cell types | journal = Nature Genetics| volume =  48| issue = 3| pages =  331–335| doi = 10.1038/ng.3487 | pmid=26780608| url = https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-predictive-computational-framework-for-direct-reprogramming-between-human-cell-types(e6490a78-f3e8-4253-acc4-7ee181c79168).html | hdl = 1983/e6490a78-f3e8-4253-acc4-7ee181c79168 | s2cid = 217524918 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Byrne (Jul 2021).

==Issues==

===Evaluation===

When examining transdifferentiated cells, it is important to look for markers of the target cell type and the absence of donor cell markers which can be accomplished using green fluorescent protein or immunodetection. It is also important to examine the cell function, [[epigenome]], [[transcriptome]], and [[proteome]] profiles. Cells can also be evaluated based upon their ability to integrate into the corresponding tissue in vivo&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and functionally replace its natural counterpart. In one study, transdifferentiating tail-tip [[fibroblasts]] into hepatocyte-like cells using transcription factors [[GATA4|Gata4]], Hnf1α and [[FOXA3|Foxa3]], and inactivation of p19(Arf) restored hepatocyte-like liver functions in only half of the mice using survival as a means of evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Transition from mouse to human cells===

Generally transdifferentiation that occurs in mouse cells does not translate in effectiveness or speediness in human cells. Pang et al. found that while transcription factors [[ASCL1|Ascl1]], [[Brn2]] and [[Myt1l]] turned mouse cells into mature neurons, the same set of factors only turned human cells into immature neurons. However, the addition of [[NeuroD1]] was able to increase efficiency and help cells reach maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Order of transcription factor expression===

The order of expression of transcription factors can direct the fate of the cell. Iwasaki et al. (2006) showed that in hematopoietic lineages, the expression timing of [[Gata-2]] and [[(C/EBPalpha)]] can change whether or not a [[lymphoid-committed progenitor]]s can differentiate into [[granulocyte]]/[[monocyte]] progenitor, [[eosinophil]], [[basophil]] or bipotent [[basophil]]/[[mast cell]] progenitor lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Immunogenicity===

It has been found for induced pluripotent stem cells that when injected into mice, the immune system of the [[synergeic]] mouse rejected the [[teratomas]] forming. Part of this may be because the immune system recognized epigenetic markers of specific sequences of the injected cells. However, when embryonic stem cells were injected, the immune response was much lower. Whether or not this will occur within transdifferentiated cells remains to be researched.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Method of transfection ===

In order to accomplish [[transfection]], one may use integrating [[viral vector]]s such as [[lentivirus]]es or [[retrovirus]]es, non-integrating vectors such as [[Sendai virus]]es or [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]], [[microRNA]]s and a variety of other methods including using proteins and [[plasmid]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Pluripotent reprogramming==
*Almost all factors that reprogram cells into pluripotency have been discovered and can turn a wide variety of cells back into [[induced pluripotent stem cells|induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)]]. However, many of the reprogramming factors that can change a cell's lineage have not been discovered and these factors apply only for that specific lineage.&lt;ref name="pmid18940730"&gt;{{Cite journal

*It may become possible in the future to use transdifferentiation in vivo, whereas pluripotent reprogramming may cause teratomas in vivo.&lt;ref name="pmid18940730"/&gt;
*Transdifferentiated cells will require less epigenetic marks to be reset, whereas pluripotent reprogramming requires nearly all to be removed, which may become an issue during redifferentiation.&lt;ref name="pmid18940730"/&gt;
*Transdifferentiation is geared towards moving between similar lineages, whereas pluripotent reprogramming has unlimited potential.&lt;ref name="pmid18940730"/&gt;
*Pluripotent cells are capable of self-renewal and often go through many cell passages, which increases the chance of accumulating mutations. Cell culture may also favor cells that are adapted for surviving under those conditions, as opposed to inside an organism. Transdifferentiation requires fewer cell passages and would reduce the chance of mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid18940730"/&gt;

In animal cells, transfection is the preferred term as transformation is also used to refer to progression to a cancerous state ([[carcinogenesis]]) in these cells. [[Transduction (genetics)|Transduction]] is often used to describe virus-mediated gene transfer into eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref name=paguide_ch12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Transduction, Genetic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''transfection'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''trans-'' and ''infection''.  [[Genetics|Genetic]] material (such as [[DNA supercoil|supercoiled plasmid DNA]] or [[siRNA]] constructs), may be transfected. Transfection of [[animal cell]]s typically involves opening transient pores or "holes" in the [[plasma membrane|cell membrane]] to allow the uptake of material. Transfection can be carried out using [[calcium phosphate]] (i.e. [[tricalcium phosphate]]), by [[electroporation]], by cell squeezing, or by mixing a [[cationic]] [[lipid]] with the material to produce [[liposomes]] that fuse with the cell membrane and deposit their cargo inside.

Transfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in target cells.

==Terminology==
The meaning of the term has evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000110186|Transfection}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original meaning of transfection was "infection by transformation", i.e., introduction of genetic material, DNA or RNA, from a [[prokaryote]]-infecting virus or [[bacteriophage]] into cells, resulting in an infection. For work with bacterial and archaeal cells transfection retains its original meaning as a special case of transformation. Because the term transformation had another sense in animal cell biology (a genetic change allowing long-term propagation in culture, or acquisition of properties typical of cancer cells), the term transfection acquired, for animal cells, its present meaning of a change in cell properties caused by introduction of DNA.{{fact|date=January 2022}}

==Methods==
There are various methods of introducing foreign [[DNA]] into a eukaryotic [[cell (biology)|cell]]: some rely on physical treatment (electroporation, cell squeezing, nanoparticles, magnetofection); others rely on chemical materials or biological particles (viruses) that are used as carriers. There are many different methods of gene delivery developed for various types of cells and tissues, from bacterial to mammalian. Generally, the methods can be divided into three categories: physical, chemical, and biological.&lt;ref name=Kim2010/&gt;

Physical methods include [[electroporation]], [[microinjection]], [[gene gun]], [[impalefection]], [[hydrostatic pressure]], continuous infusion, and sonication. Chemicals include methods such as [[lipofection]], which is a lipid-mediated DNA-transfection process utilizing liposome vectors. It can also include the use of polymeric gene carriers (polyplexes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saul JM, Linnes MP, Ratner BD, Giachelli CM, Pun SH | title = Delivery of non-viral gene carriers from sphere-templated fibrin scaffolds for sustained transgene expression | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 31 | pages = 4705–16 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17675152 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.07.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological transfection is typically mediated by [[virus]]es, utilizing the ability of a virus to inject its DNA inside a host cell. A gene that is intended for delivery is packaged into a replication-deficient viral particle. Viruses used to date include [[retrovirus]], [[lentivirus]], [[adenovirus]], [[adeno-associated virus]],  and [[herpes simplex virus]].{{fact|date=January 2022}}

===Physical methods===
[[File:Gemini X2 generator.jpg|thumbnail|Electroporator with square wave and exponential decay waveforms for in vitro, in vivo, adherent cell and 96 well electroporation applications. Manufactured by BTX Harvard Apparatus, Holliston MA USA.]]
Physical methods are the conceptually simplest, using some physical means to force the transfected material into the target cell's nucleus. The most widely used physical method is [[electroporation]], where short electrical pulses disrupt the cell membrane, allowing the transfected nucleic acids to enter the cell.&lt;ref name=Kim2010/&gt; Other physical methods use different means to poke holes in the cell membrane: [[Sonoporation]] uses high-intensity ultrasound (attributed mainly to the [[cavitation]] of gas bubbles interacting with nearby cell membranes), [[optical transfection]] uses a highly focused laser to form a ~1&amp;nbsp;µm diameter hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tsukakoshi M, Kurata S, Nomiya Y, etal |title=A Novel Method of DNA Transfection by Laser Microbeam Cell Surgery |journal=Applied Physics B: Photophysics and Laser Chemistry |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=135–140 |year=1984 |doi=10.1007/BF00697702 |bibcode=1984ApPhB..35..135T|s2cid=123250337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several methods use tools that force the nucleic acid into the cell, namely: [[microinjection]] of nucleic acid with a fine needle;&lt;ref name=Kim2010/&gt; [[biolistic particle delivery]], in which nucleic acid is attached to heavy metal particles (usually gold) and propelled into the cells at high speed;&lt;ref name=Mehier-Humbert2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehier-Humbert S, Guy RH |title=Physical methods for gene transfer: improving the kinetics of gene delivery into cells |journal=Adv Drug Deliv Rev |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=733–53 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15757758 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2004.12.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magnetofection]], where nucleic acids are attached to magnetic [[iron oxide]] particles and driven into the target cells by magnets.&lt;ref name=Mehier-Humbert2005/&gt;

[[Hydrodynamic delivery]] is a method used in mice and rats, in which nucleic acids can be delivered to the liver by injecting a relatively large volume in the blood in less than 10 seconds; nearly all of the DNA is expressed in the liver by this procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suda T, Liu D |title=Hydrodynamic delivery |journal=Adv Genet |series=Advances in Genetics |volume=89 |issue= |pages=89–111 |date=2015 |pmid=25620009 |doi=10.1016/bs.adgen.2014.10.002 |isbn=9780128022726 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical methods===
'''Chemical-based transfection''' can be divided into several kinds: [[cyclodextrin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Menuel S, Fontanay S, Clarot I, Duval RE, Diez L, Marsura A | title = Synthesis and complexation ability of a novel bis- (guanidinium)-tetrakis-(beta-cyclodextrin) dendrimeric tetrapod as a potential gene delivery (DNA and siRNA) system.

See below).

*One of the cheapest methods uses '''calcium phosphate''', originally discovered by [[Frank L. Graham|F. L. Graham]] and  [[Lex van der Eb|A. J. van der Eb]] in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graham FL, van der Eb AJ | title = A new technique for the assay of infectivity of human adenovirus 5 DNA | journal = Virology | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 456–67 | date = April 1973 | pmid = 4705382 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6822(73)90341-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bacchetti S, Graham FL | title = Transfer of the gene for thymidine kinase to thymidine kinase-deficient human cells by purified herpes simplex viral DNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 1590–4 | date = April 1977 | pmid = 193108 | pmc = 430836 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.4.1590 | bibcode = 1977PNAS...74.1590B | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[HEPES]]-buffered saline solution (HeBS) containing phosphate ions is combined with a [[calcium chloride]] solution containing the DNA to be transfected. When the two are combined, a fine precipitate of the positively charged calcium and the negatively charged phosphate will form, binding the DNA to be transfected on its surface. The suspension of the precipitate is then added to the cells to be transfected (usually a cell culture grown in a monolayer). By a process not entirely understood, the cells take up some of the precipitate, and with it, the DNA. This process has been a preferred method of identifying many oncogenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kriegler | first = Michael | name-list-style = vanc | title = Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual | year = 1991 | publisher = W. H. Freeman | isbn = 978-0-7167-7004-6 | pages = 96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another method is the use of '''cationic polymers''' such as [[DEAE|DEAE-dextran]] or [[polyethylenimine]] (PEI). The negatively charged DNA binds to the [[polycation]] and the complex is taken up by the cell via [[endocytosis]].
*{{anchor|Lipofection}}'''Lipofection''' (or [[liposome]] transfection) is a technique used to inject genetic material into a cell by means of [[liposome]]s, which are [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] that can easily merge with the [[cell membrane]] since they are both made of a [[phospholipid bilayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Felgner PL, Gadek TR, Holm M, Roman R, Chan HW, Wenz M, Northrop JP, Ringold GM, Danielsen M | title = Lipofection: a highly efficient, lipid-mediated DNA-transfection procedure | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 84 | issue = 21 | pages = 7413–7 | date = November 1987 | pmid = 2823261 | pmc = 299306 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.84.21.7413 | bibcode = 1987PNAS...84.7413F | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipofection generally uses a positively charged ([[ion|cationic]]) lipid ([[cationic liposome]]s or mixtures) to form an aggregate with the negatively charged ([[ion|anionic]]) genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Felgner JH, Kumar R, Sridhar CN, Wheeler CJ, Tsai YJ, Border R, Ramsey P, Martin M, Felgner PL | title = Enhanced gene delivery and mechanism studies with a novel series of cationic lipid formulations | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 4 | pages = 2550–61 | date = January 1994 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(17)41980-6 | pmid = 8300583 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8300583 | doi-access = free | access-date = 6 June 2016 | archive-date = 19 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190919003113/http://www.jbc.org/content/269/4/2550.long | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfection technology performs the same tasks as other biochemical procedures utilizing polymers, [[Diethylaminoethyl cellulose|DEAE-dextran]], [[calcium phosphate]], and [[electroporation]].

*'''Dendrimer''' is a class of highly branched molecules based on various building blocks and synthesized through a convergent or a divergent method.

===Viral methods===
DNA can also be introduced into cells using [[virus]]es as a carrier. In such cases, the technique is called [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], and the cells are said to be transduced. [[Adeno-associated virus|Adenoviral]] vectors can be useful for viral transfection methods because they can transfer genes into a wide variety of human cells and have high transfer rates.&lt;ref name=paguide_ch12/&gt; Lentiviral vectors are also helpful due to their ability to transduce cells not currently undergoing mitosis.

Protoplast fusion is a technique in which transformed bacterial cells are treated with lysozyme in order to remove the cell wall. Following this, fusogenic agents (e.g., Sendai virus, PEG, electroporation) are used in order to fuse the protoplast carrying the gene of interest with the target recipient cell. A major disadvantage of this method is that bacterial components are non-specifically introduced into the target cell as well.

==Stable and transient transfection==
Stable and transient transfection differ in their long term effects on a cell; a stably-transfected cell will continuously express transfected DNA and pass it on to [[Cell division|daughter cells]], while a transiently-transfected cell will express transfected DNA for a short amount of time and not pass it on to daughter cells.

For some applications of transfection, it is sufficient if the transfected genetic material is only transiently expressed. Since the DNA introduced in the transfection process is usually not integrated into the nuclear genome, the foreign DNA will be diluted through [[mitosis]] or degraded.&lt;ref name=Kim2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TK, Eberwine JH | title = Mammalian cell transfection: the present and the future | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 397 | issue = 8 | pages = 3173–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20549496 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-010-3821-6 | pmc=2911531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell lines expressing the [[Epstein–Barr virus]] (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) or the SV40 large-T antigen, allow episomal amplification of plasmids containing the viral EBV (293E) or SV40 (293T) origins of replication, greatly reducing the rate of dilution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durocher Y, Perret S, Kamen A | title = High-level and high-throughput recombinant protein production by transient transfection of suspension-growing human 293-EBNA1 cells | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 9e–9 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11788735 | pmc = 99848 | doi = 10.1093/nar/30.2.e9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is desired that the transfected gene actually remain in the genome of the cell and its daughter cells, a stable transfection must occur.  To accomplish this, a [[marker gene]] is co-transfected, which gives the cell some selectable advantage, such as resistance towards a certain [[toxin]]. Some (very few) of the transfected cells will, by chance, have integrated the foreign genetic material into their genome. If the toxin is then added to the cell culture, only those few cells with the marker gene integrated into their genomes will be able to [[cell proliferation|proliferate]], while other cells will die. After applying this selective stress (selection pressure) for some time, only the cells with a stable transfection remain and can be cultivated further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science of Stable Cell Line Generation|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli | name-list-style = vanc | url = http://www.stablecellline.com/the-science-of-stable-cell-line-generation/|date=2016|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common agents for selecting stable transfection are:

* [[Geneticin]], or G418,  neutralized by the product of the [[neomycin]] resistance gene
* [[Puromycin]]
* [[Zeocin]]
* [[Hygromycin B]]
* [[Blasticidin S]]

==RNA transfection==
RNA can also be transfected into cells to transiently express its coded protein, or to study [[MRNA#Degradation|RNA decay]] kinetics. RNA transfection is often used in primary cells that do not divide.

[[siRNA|siRNAs]] can also be transfected to achieve RNA silencing (i.e. loss of RNA and protein from the targeted gene). This has become a major application in research to achieve "[[Gene knockdown|knock-down]]" of proteins of interests (e.g. Endothelin-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mawji IA, Marsden PA | title = RNA transfection is a versatile tool to investigate endothelin-1 posttranscriptional regulation | journal = Experimental Biology and Medicine | volume = 231 | issue = 6 | pages = 704–708 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16740984 | doi = 10.3181/00379727-231-2310704 | url = https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3181/00379727-231-2310704 | doi-broken-date = 31 July 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) with potential applications in gene therapy. Limitation of the silencing approach are the toxicity of the transfection for cells and potential "off-target" effects on the expression of other genes/proteins.

RNA can be purified from cells after [[lysis]] or synthesized from free [[nucleotide]]s either chemically, or enzymatically using an [[RNA polymerase]] to [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribe]] a [[DNA]] template.  As with DNA, RNA can be delivered to cells by a variety of means including [[microinjection]], [[electroporation]], and [[Liposome|lipid-mediated transfection]].  If the RNA encodes a [[protein]], transfected cells may [[Translation (genetics)|translate]] the RNA into the encoded protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herb M, Farid A, Gluschko A, Krönke M, Schramm M | title = Highly Efficient Transfection of Primary Macrophages with In Vitro Transcribed mRNA  | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | date = November 2019 | issue = 153 | doi=10.3791/60143  | pmid = 31762462 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the RNA is a regulatory RNA (such as a [[MicroRNA|miRNA]]), the RNA may cause other changes in the cell (such as [[RNA interference|RNAi-mediated knockdown]]).

Encapsulating the RNA molecule in [[solid lipid nanoparticles|lipid nanoparticles]] was a breakthrough for producing viable [[RNA vaccines]], solving a number of key technical barriers in delivering the RNA molecule into the human cell.&lt;ref name=Stat4&gt;{{cite web | website=[[Stat (website)|Stat]] | date=1 December 2020 | accessdate=3 December 2020 | url=https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/01/how-nanotechnology-helps-mrna-covid19-vaccines-work/ | title=How nanotechnology helps mRNA Covid-19 vaccines work | first=Elizabeth | last=Cooney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Foley |first1=Katherine Ellen |title=The first Covid-19 vaccines have changed biotech forever |url=https://qz.com/1948132/the-first-covid-19-vaccines-have-changed-biotech-forever/ |access-date=11 January 2021 |work=Quartz |publisher=Quartz Media |date=22 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA molecules shorter than about 25nt (nucleotides) largely evade detection by the [[innate immune system]], which is triggered by longer RNA molecules.  Most cells of the body express proteins of the innate immune system, and upon exposure to exogenous long RNA molecules, these proteins initiate signaling cascades that result in [[inflammation]].  This inflammation hypersensitizes the exposed cell and nearby cells to subsequent exposure.  As a result, while a cell can be repeatedly transfected with short RNA with few non-specific effects, repeatedly transfecting cells with even a small amount of long RNA can cause cell death unless measures are taken to suppress or evade the innate immune system (see "Long-RNA transfection" below).

Short-RNA transfection is routinely used in biological research to knock down the expression of a protein of interest (using [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]]) or to express or block the activity of a [[MicroRNA|miRNA]] (using short RNA that acts independently of the cell's [[RNA interference|RNAi]] machinery, and therefore is not referred to as siRNA).  While DNA-based vectors ([[virus]]es, [[plasmid]]s) that encode a short RNA molecule can also be used, short-RNA transfection does not risk modification of the cell's DNA, a characteristic that has led to the development of short RNA as a new class of [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] [[drug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/11/BUGPNKFU6T1.DTL | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | author=Tansey B | title=Macular degeneration treatment interferes with RNA messages | date=11 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-RNA transfection is the process of deliberately introducing RNA molecules longer than about 25nt into living cells.  A distinction is made between short- and long-RNA transfection because exogenous long RNA molecules elicit an [[Innate immune system|innate immune response]] in cells that can cause a variety of nonspecific effects including [[Translation (biology)|translation]] block, [[Cell cycle|cell-cycle]] arrest, and [[apoptosis]].

===Endogenous vs. exogenous long RNA===
The innate immune system has evolved to protect against [[infection]] by detecting [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMPs), and triggering a complex set of responses collectively known as "[[inflammation]]".  Many cells express specific [[pattern recognition receptor]]s (PRRs) for exogenous RNA including [[toll-like receptor]] 3,7,8 ([[TLR3]], [[TLR7]], [[TLR8]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/35099560 |vauthors=Alexopoulou L, Holt AC, Medzhitov R, Flavell RA | title=Recognition of double-stranded RNA and activation of NF-kappaB by Toll-like receptor 3 | journal=Nature | year=2001 | volume=413 | issue=6857 | pages=732–738 | pmid=11607032|bibcode=2001Natur.413..732A |s2cid=4346537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1074/jbc.M310175200 |vauthors=Kariko K, Ni H, Capodici J, Lamphier M, Weissman D | title=mRNA is an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 3 | journal=J Biol Chem | year=2004 | volume=279 | issue=13 | pages=12542–12550 | pmid=14729660| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kariko05&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2005.06.008 |vauthors=Kariko K, Buckstein M, Ni H, Weissman D | title=Suppression of RNA recognition by Toll-like receptors: the impact of nucleoside modification and the evolutionary origin of RNA | journal=Immunity | year=2005 | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=165–175 | pmid=16111635| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1093616 |vauthors=Diebold SS, Kaisho T, Hemmi H, Akira S, Reis e Sousa C | title=Innate antiviral responses by means of TLR7-mediated recognition of single-stranded RNA | journal=Science | year=2004 | volume=303 | issue=5663 | pages=1529–1531 | pmid=14976261|bibcode=2004Sci...303.1529D |s2cid=33144196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the RNA [[helicase]] [[RARRES3|RIG1 (RARRES3)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/ni1087  |vauthors=Yoneyama M, Kikuchi M, Natsukawa T, Shinobu N, Imaizumi T, etal | title=The RNA helicase RIG-I has an essential function in double-stranded RNA-induced innate antiviral responses | journal=Nat Immunol | year=2004 | volume=5 | issue=7 | pages=730–737 | pmid=15208624|s2cid=34876422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protein kinase R]] (PKR, a.k.a.

All of these proteins can specifically bind to exogenous RNA molecules and trigger an immune response.
The specific chemical, structural or other characteristics of long RNA molecules that are required for recognition by PRRs remain largely unknown despite intense study.  At any given time, a typical [[mammal]]ian cell may contain several hundred thousand mRNA and other, [[Long noncoding RNA|regulatory long RNA]] molecules.  How cells distinguish exogenous long RNA from the large amount of endogenous long RNA is an important open question in [[cell biology]].  Several reports suggest that [[phosphorylation]] of the 5'-end of a long RNA molecule can influence its [[immunogenicity]], and specifically that 5'-triphosphate RNA, which can be produced during viral infection, is more immunogenic than 5'-diphosphate RNA, 5'-monophosphate RNA or RNA containing no 5' phosphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1132505  |vauthors=Hornung V, Ellegast J, Kim S, Brzozka K, Jung A, etal | title=5'-triphosphate RNA is the ligand for RIG-I | journal=Science | year=2006 | volume=314 | issue=5801 | pages=994–997 | pmid=17038590|bibcode=2006Sci...314..964H |s2cid=22436759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature07106 |author1=Saito T |author2=Owen DM |author3=Jiang F |author4=Marcotrigiano J |author5=Gale M, Jr. | title=Innate immunity induced by composition-dependent RIG-I recognition of Hepatitis C virus RNA | journal=Nature | year=2008 | volume=454 | issue=7203 | pages=523–527 | pmid=18548002 | pmc=2856441|bibcode=2008Natur.454..523S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.11.028  |vauthors=Takahasi K, Yoneyama M, Nishihori T, Hirai R, Kumeta H, etal | title=Nonself RNA-sensing mechanism of RIG-I helicase and activation of antiviral immune responses | journal=Mol Cell | year=2008 | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=428–440 | pmid=18242112| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2008.07.009 |vauthors=Yoneyama M, Fujita T | title=Structural mechanism of RNA recognition by the RIG-I-like receptors | journal=Immunity | year=2008 | volume=29 | issue=2 | pages=178–181 | pmid=18701081| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.0900971106  |vauthors=Schmidt A, Schwerd T, Hamm W, Hellmuth JC, Cui S, etal | title=5'-triphosphate RNA requires base-paired structures to activate antiviral signaling via RIG-I | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | year=2009 | volume=106 | issue=29 | pages=12067–12072 | pmid=19574455 | pmc=2705279|bibcode=2009PNAS..10612067S |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2009.05.008  |vauthors=Schlee M, Roth A, Hornung V, Hagmann CA, Wimmenauer V, etal | title=Recognition of 5'-triphosphate by RIG-I helicase requires short blunt double-stranded RNA as contained in panhandle of negative strand virus | journal=Immunity | year=2009 | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=25–34 | pmid=19576794 | pmc=2824854}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in vitro-transcribed (ivT) long RNA containing a [[5' cap|7-methylguanosine cap]] (present in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] mRNA) is also highly immunogenic despite having no 5' phosphate,&lt;ref name=Angel10&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Angel M, Yanik MF | title=Innate Immune Suppression Enables Frequent Transfection with RNA Encoding Reprogramming Proteins| journal=PLOS ONE| year=2010| volume=5  | issue = 7| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011756 | pages=e11756 | pmid=20668695 | pmc=2909252| bibcode=2010PLoSO...511756A| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that characteristics other than 5'-phosphorylation can influence the immunogenicity of an RNA molecule.

Although only a very small number of these modified nucleotides are present in a typical mRNA molecule, they may help prevent mRNA from activating the innate immune system by disrupting [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structure]] that would resemble double-stranded RNA (dsRNA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herb M, Farid A, Gluschko A, Krönke M, Schramm M | title = Highly Efficient Transfection of Primary Macrophages with In Vitro Transcribed mRNA  | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | date = November 2019 | issue = 153 | doi=10.3791/60143  | pmid = 31762462 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kariko05 /&gt; a type of RNA thought to be present in cells only during viral infection.

===Repeated long-RNA transfection===
Inhibiting only three proteins, [[Interferon type I|interferon-β]], [[STAT2]], and [[protein kinase R|EIF2AK2]] is sufficient to rescue human [[fibroblast]]s from the cell death caused by frequent transfection with long, protein-encoding RNA.&lt;ref name=Angel10 /&gt; Inhibiting interferon signaling disrupts the positive-feedback loop that normally hypersensitizes cells exposed to exogenous long RNA.

They are artificial [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] that have been derived from the naturally occurring [[Ti plasmid]] found in bacterial species of the genus ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', such as ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|A. tumefaciens]]''. The binary vector is a ''shuttle vector'', so-called because it is able to [[DNA replication|replicate]] in multiple hosts (e.g. ''[[E. coli|Escherichia coli]]'' and ''Agrobacterium'').

Systems in which [[Transfer DNA|T-DNA]] and ''vir'' genes are located on separate replicons are called T-DNA binary systems. T-DNA is located on the binary vector (the non-T-DNA region of this vector containing origin(s) of replication that could function both in ''E. coli'' and ''Agrobacterium'', and [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] genes used to select for the presence of the binary vector in bacteria, became known as vector backbone sequences). The replicon containing the ''vir'' genes became known as the ''vir'' helper plasmid. The ''vir'' helper plasmid is considered disarmed if it does not contain oncogenes that could be transferred to a plant.

==Binary system components==

===T-DNA binary vector===

There are several binary vectors that replicate in ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' and can be used for delivery of T-DNA from ''Agrobacterium'' into plant cells. The T-DNA portion of the binary vector is flanked by left and right border sequences and may include a [[transgene]] as well as a plant [[selectable marker]]. Outside of the T-DNA, the binary vector also contains a bacterial selectable marker and an [[origin of replication]] (ori) for bacteria.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Slater | first1 = Adrian | last2 = Scott | first2 = Nigel | last3 = Fowler | first3 = Mark | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2008 | title = Plant Biotechnology the genetic manipulation of plants. | publisher = Oxford University Press Inc. | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vir'' helper plasmid===

The ''vir'' helper plasmid contains the ''vir'' genes that originated from the [[Ti plasmid]] of ''Agrobacterium''. These genes code for a series of proteins that cut the binary vector at the left and right border sequences, and facilitate transfer and integration of T-DNA to the plant's cells and genomes, respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Several ''vir'' helper plasmids have been reported,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hellens R, Mullineaux P, Klee H | title = Technical Focus:a guide to Agrobacterium binary Ti vectors | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 446–51 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11044722 | doi = 10.1016/s1360-1385(00)01740-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and common ''Agrobacterium'' strains that include ''vir'' helper plasmids are:
*[[EHA101]]
*EHA105
*AGL-1
*LBA4404
*GV2260

==Development of T-DNA binary vectors==
The pBIN19 vector was developed in the 1980s and is one of the first and most widely used binary vectors. The pGreen vector, which was developed in 2000, is a newer version of the binary vector that allows for a choice of promoters, selectable markers and reporter genes. Another distinguishing feature of pGreen is its large reduction in size (from about 11,7kbp to 4,6kbp) from pBIN19, therefore increasing its [[transformation efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgreen.ac.uk/|title=pGreen on the Web|website=www.pgreen.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with higher transformation efficiency, pGreen has been engineered to ensure transformation integrity. Both pBIN19 and pGreen usually use the same selectable marker ''nptII'', but pBIN19 has the selectable marker next to the right border, while pGreen has it close to the left border. Due to a polarity difference in the left and right borders, the right border of the T-DNA enters the host plant first. If the selectable maker is near the right border (as is the case with pBIN19) and the transformation process is interrupted, the resulting plant may have expression of a selectable marker but contain no T-DNA giving a false positive. The pGreen vector has the selectable marker entering the host last (due to its location next to the left border) so any expression of the marker will result in full transgene integration.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The pGreen-based vectors are not autonomous and they will not replicate in ''Agrobacterium'' if [[PGreen|pSoup]] is not present. Series of small binary vectors that autonomously replicate in ''E. coli'' and ''Agrobacterium'' include:

* pCB &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* pLSU &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* pLX &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''transfer DNA''' (abbreviated '''T-DNA''') is the transferred [[DNA]] of the [[Ti plasmid|tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid]] of some species of bacteria such as ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' and ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]](actually an Ri plasmid)''. The T-DNA is transferred from bacterium into the host plant's [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] DNA [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelvin|first=Stanton B.|date=2017-11-27|title=Integration of Agrobacterium T-DNA into the Plant Genome|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genet-120215-035320|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=51|issue=1|pages=195–217|doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-120215-035320|pmid=28853920|issn=0066-4197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capability of this specialized tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid is attributed to two essential regions required for DNA transfer to the host cell. The T-DNA is bordered by 25-base-pair repeats on each end. Transfer is initiated at the right border and terminated at the left border and requires the ''vir'' genes of the Ti plasmid.

== Mechanism of transformation in nature ==
The infection process of T-DNA into the host cell and integration into its nucleus involve multiple steps. First, the bacteria multiply in the wound sap before infection and then attach to the plant cell walls. The bacterial virulence genes expression of approximately 10 [[operon]]s is activated by perception of phenolic compounds such as [[acetosyringone]] emitted by wounded plant tissue and follows cell-cell contact. Then this process proceeds with the [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] [[Translocation (genetics)|translocation]] from ''Agrobacterium'' to cytoplasm of host cell, transmission of T-DNA along with associated proteins (called '''T-complex''') to the host cell nucleus followed by disassembly of the T-complex, stable integration of T-DNA into host plant [[genome]], and eventual expression of the transferred [[gene]]s. The integration of T-DNA into a host genome involves the formation of a single-stranded nick in the DNA at the right border of the Ti plasmid. This nick creates a region of single stranded DNA from the left border of the T-DNA gene over to the right border which was cut. Then, single stranded binding proteins attach to the single stranded DNA. DNA synthesis displaces the single stranded region and then a second nick at the left border region releases the single stranded T-DNA fragment. Further this fragment can  be incorporated into a host genome.&lt;ref name="pmid24166430"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lacroix B, Citovsky V|date=2013|title=The roles of bacterial and host plant factors in Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation|journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology|volume=57|issue=6–8|pages=467–81|doi=10.1387/ijdb.130199bl|pmid=24166430|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Agrobacterium'' has been known to evolve a control system that uses plant host factors and cellular processes for several pathways of host-plant defense response to invade the host cell nucleus. For the integration of T-DNA into the target host genome, ''Agrobacterium'' carries out multiple interactions with host-plant factors.&lt;ref name="pmid24166430" /&gt; To interact with host plant proteins many ''Agrobacterium'' virulence proteins encoded by vir genes. ''Agrobacterium'' ''vir'' gene expression occurs via the VirA-VirG sensor that results in generation of a mobile single-stranded T-DNA copy (T-strand).  A processed form of VirB2 is the major component of the T-complex that is required for transformation. VirD2 is the protein that caps the 5′ end of the transferred T-strand by covalent attachment and is transported to the host cell cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koukolíková-Nicola Z, Raineri D, Stephens K, Ramos C, Tinland B, Nester EW, Hohn B|date=February 1993|title=Genetic analysis of the virD operon of Agrobacterium tumefaciens: a search for functions involved in transport of T-DNA into the plant cell nucleus and in T-DNA integration|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=175|issue=3|pages=723–31|doi=10.1128/jb.175.3.723-731.1993|pmc=196211|pmid=8380800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arya|first=Aditya|date=February 2017|title=Agrobacterium Pathology and Ti Plasmid based Vector Design.|journal=High Value Notes|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.18345.49769/1|name-list-style=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; VirE2 is the single-stranded DNA binding protein that presumably coats the T- strand in the host cytoplasm by cooperative binding. It is then directed into the nucleus via interactions with the host cell proteins such as importin a, bacterial VirE3, and dynein-like proteins. Several other bacterial virulence effectors like VirB5, VirB7 (the minor components of the T-complex), VirD5, VirE2, VirE3, and VirF that may also interact with proteins of host plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gelvin SB|date=March 2003|title=Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation: the biology behind the "gene-jockeying" tool|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=67|issue=1|pages=16–37, table of contents|doi=10.1128/mmbr.67.1.16-37.2003|pmc=150518|pmid=12626681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in biotechnology ==
''Agrobacterium''-mediated T-DNA transfer is widely used as a tool in [[biotechnology]]. For more than two decades, ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' has been exploited for introducing genes into plants for basic research as well as for commercial production of [[transgenic crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oltmanns H, Frame B, Lee LY, Johnson S, Li B, Wang K, Gelvin SB|date=March 2010|title=Generation of backbone-free, low transgene copy plants by launching T-DNA from the Agrobacterium chromosome|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=152|issue=3|pages=1158–66|doi=10.1104/pp.109.148585|pmc=2832237|pmid=20023148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[genetic engineering]], the tumor-promoting and opine-synthesis genes are removed from the T-DNA and replaced with a gene of interest and/or a selection marker, which is required to establish which plants have been successfully transformed. Examples of selection markers include neomycin phosphotransferase, hygromycin B phosphotransferase (which both phosphorylate antibiotics) and [[phosphinothricin acetyltransferase]] (which acetylates and deactivates [[phosphinothricin]], a potent inhibitor of [[glutamine synthetase]]) or a [[herbicide]] formulations such as Basta or Bialophos.&lt;ref name="pmid18250230"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lee LY, Gelvin SB|date=February 2008|title=tDNA binary vectors and systems|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=146|issue=2|pages=325–32|doi=10.1104/pp.107.113001|pmc=2245830|pmid=18250230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another selection system that can be employed is usage of metabolic markers such as phospho-mannose isomerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Todd R, Tague BW|date=2001-12-01|title=Phosphomannose isomerase: A versatile selectable marker forArabidopsis thaliana germ-line transformation|journal=Plant Molecular Biology Reporter|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=307–319|doi=10.1007/bf02772829|s2cid=46196053|issn=0735-9640}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agrobacterium'' is then used as a vector to transfer the engineered T-DNA into the plant cells where it integrates into the plant genome. This method can be used to generate [[transgenic plant]]s carrying a foreign gene. ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' is capable of transferring foreign DNA to both [[monocotyledons]] and [[dicotyledonous]] plants efficiently while taking care of critically important factors like the genotype of plants, types and ages of tissues inoculated, kind of vectors, strains of ''Agrobacterium'', selection marker genes and selective agents, and various conditions of tissue culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The same procedure of T-DNA transfer can be used to disrupt genes via [[insertional mutagenesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid10590158" /&gt; Not only does the inserted T-DNA sequence create a mutation but its insertion also 'tags'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu YG, Shirano Y, Fukaki H, Yanai Y, Tasaka M, Tabata S, Shibata D|date=May 1999|title=Complementation of plant mutants with large genomic DNA fragments by a transformation-competent artificial chromosome vector accelerates positional cloning|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=96|issue=11|pages=6535–40|bibcode=1999PNAS...96.6535L|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.11.6535|pmc=26917|pmid=10339623|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; the affected gene, thus allowing for its isolation as T-DNA flanking sequences. A reporter gene can be linked to the right end of the T-DNA to be transformed along with a plasmid replicon and a selectable antibiotic (such as [[hygromycin]])-resistance gene and can explicit approximately 30% of average efficiency having successful T-DNA inserts induced [[gene fusion]]s in ''Arabidopsis thaliana''.&lt;ref name="pmid2554318"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koncz C, Martini N, Mayerhofer R, Koncz-Kalman Z, Körber H, Redei GP, Schell J|date=November 1989|title=High-frequency T-DNA-mediated gene tagging in plants|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=86|issue=21|pages=8467–71|bibcode=1989PNAS...86.8467K|doi=10.1073/pnas.86.21.8467|pmc=298303|pmid=2554318|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reverse genetics]] involves testing the presumed function of a gene that is known by disrupting it and then looking for the effect of that induced mutation on the organismal phenotype.  T-DNA tagging mutagenesis involves screening of populations by T-DNA insertional mutations. Collections of known T-DNA mutations provide resources to study the functions of individual genes, as developed for the model plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' .&lt;ref name="pmid28217003"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ben-Amar A, Daldoul S, Reustle GM, Krczal G, Mliki A|date=December 2016|title=Reverse Genetics and High Throughput Sequencing Methodologies for Plant Functional Genomics|journal=Current Genomics|volume=17|issue=6|pages=460–475|doi=10.2174/1389202917666160520102827|pmc=5282599|pmid=28217003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of T-DNA insertion mutations in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' include those associated many classes of phenotypes including seedling-lethals, size variants, pigment variants, embryo-defectives, reduced-fertility, and morphologically or physiologically aberrant plants &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Kenneth A.|date=1991-07-01|title=T-DNA insertion mutagenesis in Arabidopsis: mutational spectrum|journal=The Plant Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=71–82|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313x.1991.00071.x|issn=1365-313X|name-list-style=vanc|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transformed cladistics''', also known as '''pattern cladistics''' is an epistemological approach to the [[cladistic]] method of phylogenetic inference and classification that makes no a priori assumptions about [[common ancestry]]. It was advocated by [[Norman Platnick]], [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]], Ronald Brady and others in the 1980s, but has few modern proponents. The book, ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. M. and M. C. Ebach. 2008. ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''. Springer Science+Business Media, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; by David Williams and Malte Ebach provides a thoughtful history of the origins of this point of view.

==Patterns vs. processes==
The traditional approach to cladistics, which traces back to [[Willi Hennig]],&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1950. Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik. Deutscher Zentralverlag, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1966. Phylogenetic systematics. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL.
&lt;/ref&gt; groups together organisms based on whether or not they share derived characters or character states that are assumed to be descended from a common ancestor. Transformed cladists maintain that the assumption of [[common descent]] is uninformative and/or potentially misleading, and that therefore cladistic methods should be free from evolutionary process assumptions, and based only on [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] interpretation of empirical data:

{{Quote|"If classifications (that is, our knowledge of patterns) are ever to provide an adequate test of theories of evolutionary processes their construction must be independent of any particular theory of process." (Platnick, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;Platnick, N. I. (1979). "Philosophy and the transformation of cladistics". ''Systematic Zoology''. 28: 537–546.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, pattern cladists argue that the fewer evolutionary assumptions a classification presupposes, the fewer errors creep in, and greater transparency results. They draw a distinction between patterns, which are observed, and processes, which may be inferred from patterns, but which should not be presupposed. Before the emergence of cladistics as a school, [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] criticized phylogenetic systematics on the grounds that homology by way of common ancestry is "putting the cart before the horse, because descent from a common ancestor is something assumed, not observed. It belongs to theory, whereas morphological correspondence is observed.".&lt;ref&gt;Woodger, S. (1945). “On Biological Transformations”. In: ''Essays on Growth and Form''. Le Gros Clark, W. E., Medawar, P. B (eds.). Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]] later wrote similarly:

{{Quote|"We must remember the distinction between the cart--the explanation--and the horse--the data. And where models are introduced in phylogenetic reconstruction, we should prefer models dictated by features of the data to models derived from explanatory theories."&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. (1994). "Null or minimal models". In: ''Models In Phylogeny Reconstruction''. Scotland, R. W. , Siebert, D. J. (eds.). Systematics Association Special Volume; 173-192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pattern cladists, like traditional cladists, think that classifications should be isomorphic to cladograms, recognizing groups based on nested patterns of [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]], but they argue that the discovery of characters is not dependent on apriori considerations about common ancestry:

{{Quote|"[T]o state a cladogram is a synapomorphy scheme invites the rejoinder that a cladogram must, therefore be a phyletic concept. Not so, for by ‘synapomorphy’ we mean ‘defining character’ of an inclusive taxon."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, G. J., Platnick, N. I. (1981). ''Systematics and biogeography: cladistics and vicariance'' (Vol. 214). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nelson &amp; Platnick (1981) also noted that: "''all'' of Hennig’s groups correspond by definition to patterns of synapomorphy. Indeed, Hennig’s trees are frequently called synapomorphy schemes. The concept of ‘patterns within patterns’ seems, therefore, an empirical generalization.” Pattern cladists hence regard synapomorphies to be patterns free of processes.

==Criticism==
A frequent (but false) accusation against pattern cladistics is that its proponents claim that systematics should be "theory free." At some point in the 1960s and '70s [[Phenetics|pheneticists]] may have believed that, but pattern cladists are not pheneticists. Obviously, rejecting a priori evolutionary process theories is not the same thing as categorically rejecting "theory" in toto. Furthermore, pattern cladists do not reject post hoc evolutionary explanations for cladograms, they simply think that the evidence is independent of the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1985). "On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some philosophers with a background conciliatory towards [[evolutionary taxonomy]] continue to offer criticisms in this vein:
{{Quote|"Pattern cladistics has remained on the fringe because of, first, its implausible assumption that there can be pure observation untainted by theory; and second, its rejection of the evolution assumption. Few systematists now think that a classification not based on evolutionary branching and history has any real signification or justification. The developing consensus is that Darwin was right – a natural classification must be genealogical."&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M. (2008). ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Biology''. Oxford University Press. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of course, the distinction between the phenomenon and its explanation was clear to Darwin: "the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group, which from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment fully explained."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1859. On the Origin of Species. John Murray, London, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady &lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1982). "Theoretical Issues and 'Pattern Cladistics'". ''Systematic Zoology''. 3. 286-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1985). "On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced to systematics the terms ''explanandum'' for empirical patterns (the phenomenon to be explained) and ''explanans'' for process theory (the explanation), writing: "by making our explanation into the definition of the condition [data] to be explained, we express not scientific hypothesis but belief". In the above quote, Darwin's "fact" is the ''explanandum''; his theory of descent with modification is the ''explanans''.

In this view, whatever the characters imply as the preferred hypothesis of relationships becomes, de facto, "genealogical" when we explain it as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, A. V. Z. 2002. Cladistics, phylogeny, evidence and explanation - a reply to Lee. Zool. Scripta 31:221-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationist distortion==
As noted, transformed cladistics does not deny [[common ancestry]], rather it argues a logical precedence: theories regarding processes should only be formulated after patterns are discovered. Creationists have distorted this to argue that there are pattern cladists who are skeptical about whether evolution occurs.

===Colin Patterson===
In November, 1981, [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Patterson]] delivered a seminar to the Systematics Discussion Group in the American Museum of Natural History.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. 2002. Systematics and creationism. The Linnean 18:13-37.
&lt;/ref&gt; In the talk, Patterson asked provocatively: "Can you tell me anything about evolution, any one thing that is true?", and remarked:

{{Quote|"As I understand it, cladistics is theoretically neutral so far as evolution is concerned. It has nothing to say about evolution. You don’t need to know about evolution, or believe in it, to do cladistic analysis. All that cladistics demands is that groups have characters."}}

A [[creationist]] in the audience taped segments of Patterson's talk to imply he was "agnostic" on the subject of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution Colin Patterson: Evolution, Reports of the National Center for Science Education]&lt;/ref&gt; To his dismay, Patterson soon found his name quoted in creationist publications:

{{Quote|"I was too naive and foolish to guess what might happen: the talk was taped by a creationist who passed the tape to Luther Sunderland [...] Since, in my view, the tape was obtained unethically, I asked Sunderland to stop circulating the transcipt, but of course to no effect. There is not much point in my going through the article point by point. I was putting a case for discussion, as I thought off the record, and was speaking only about systematics, a specialized field. I do not support the creationist movement in any way, and in particular I am opposed to their efforts to modify school curricula. In short the article does not fairly represent my views. But even if it did, so what? The issue should be resolved by rational discussion, and not by quoting 'authorities,' which seems to be the creationists' principal mode of argument." (Letter from Colin Patterson to Steven W. Binkley, June 17, 1982)}}

{{Quote|"Unfortunately, and unknown to me, there was a creationist in my audience with a hidden tape recorder. A transcript of my talk was produced and circulated among creationists, and the talk has since been widely, and often inaccurately, quoted in creationist literature." (Patterson, 1994)}} (Note that a transcript of Patterson's talk has been published in the Linnean 18(2),and may be [https://www.linnean.org/our-publications/the-linnean/the-linnean-back-issues-2001-2010 downloaded] from the Linnean Society).

{{Quote|text="Because creationists lack scientific research to support such theories as a young earth ... a world-wide flood ... or separate ancestry for humans and apes, their common tactic is to attack evolution by hunting out debate or dissent among evolutionary biologists. ... I learned that one should think carefully about candour in argument (in publications, lectures, or correspondence) in case one was furnishing creationist campaigners with ammunition in the form of 'quotable quotes', often taken out of context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartelt |first=Karen |date=May–June 2000 |title=Review: Evolution |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |type=Book review |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=38–39 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2015-05-21}} Bartelt quoting from Patterson, ''Evolution'' (1999), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Richard Dawkins in "The Extended Phenotype" notes that "bacterial endosymbionts of insects which are transmitted transovarially" share an interest in the "success of their host's gametes.....as well as the survival of their host's body." In this case, "the interest of the host genes and parasite genes might not be quite identical, but they would..... be very much closer than the case of fluke and snail." where host and parasite have different means of propagation into the next generation, and therefore more divergent interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1156420992 |title=The extended phenotype : the long reach of the gene |isbn=978-0-19-878891-1 |oclc=1156420992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transposon silencing''' is a form of transcriptional gene silencing targeting transposons. Transcriptional gene silencing is a product of [[Histone|histone modifications]] that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including [[hemophilia]], [[severe combined immunodeficiency]], and predisposition to [[cancer]]. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these [[epigenetic]] defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in ''[[Drosophila]]'', ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', and mice all indicate that [[small interfering RNA]]s are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these [[Small interfering RNA|siRNAS]] and [[Piwi-interacting RNA|piRNAs]] are most active in the [[gonads]].

== Mechanism ==

Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), the largest class of the small RNAs, are between 26 and 31 nucleotides in length and function through interactions with piwi proteins from the [[Argonaute|Argonaute protein family]] (gene silencing proteins).  Many piRNAs are derived from transposons and other repeated elements, and therefore lack specific loci.  Other piRNAs that do map to specific locations are clustered in areas near the centromeres or telomeres of the chromosome. piRNA clusters make up ~1% of the genome (Khurana, 4).  
	It is thought that piRNA-PIWI complexes directly control the activity of transposons. piRNAs bound to PIWI proteins seem to use post-transcriptional transcript destruction to silence transposons (4). Transposon insertions in [[introns]] can escape silencing via the piRNA pathway, suggesting that transcript destruction by piRNAs occurs after [[nuclear export]]. piRNAs could, however, act on multiple levels, including guiding [[heterochromatin]] assembly and possibly playing a role in translation as well .
	The exact biogenesis of piRNAs is still unknown. Most piRNAs are antisense to [[mRNA]]s transcribed from the silenced transposons, generally associating with Piwi and Aubergine (Aub) proteins, while sense-strand piRNAs tend to associate with Argonaute 3 (Ago3) instead (4).  A cycle called “ping pong” amplification proceeds between the sense and anti-sense piRNAs involving extensive trimming and processing to create mature piRNAs.  This process is responsible for the production of most piRNAs in the germline and could also explain the origin of piRNAs in germline development (3).

== History ==

piRNAs were first observed in Drosophila in 1990 (Johnson, 2). In 2003, piRNAs derived largely from repeated sequence elements, including transposons, were found in abundance in male and female ''Drosophila'' germlines (Theurkauf, 5). Since then, several studies have identified various piRNAs and piwi-pathways involved in transposon silencing in various species. Two such genome defense systems against transposons are the silencing of the MuDR transposon in maize and the silencing of [[P elements]] in ''Drosophila''.

=== MuDR ===

In 2006, a study by Margaret Roth Woodhouse, Michael Freeling, and Damon Lisch identified a gene that inhibits the transcription of both transposons and paramuted color gens in maize (Woodhouse, 6). The gene, called ''Mediator of paramutation1'' (Mop1), codes for an RNA-processing enzyme that is necessary for making the small RNAs that are responsible for silencing the transposon MuDR. A second gene, Mu killer (MuK), is then needed to establish heritable silencing (Gross, 1).

=== P elements ===

P elements are a family of transposons that recently proliferated within the genome of ''Drosophila melanogaster''.  The P elements have an extremely high transposition rate and induce sterility and abnormal gonad development in ''D. melanogaster'' (Johnson, 2).  The flies thus developed a maternally inherited technique for combating the invasive DNA and silencing the transposons, now known as P cytotype. P cytotype detects DNA sequences in areas of telomeric heterochromatin and silences those sequences when they are found elsewhere in the genome. This is referred to as the telomeric-silencing effect (TSE) (2).  Just two P elements in the [[telomere]] are enough to suppress over 80 other copies of the P element in the genome.  The cytoplasmic factor used for TSE builds up over generations and suppression of the transposons is not fully effective unless the fly’s female-line ancestors have had the P element for six generations (2).

The '''tree of life''' or '''universal tree of life''' is a [[metaphor]], model and research tool used to explore the [[evolution]] of life and describe the relationships between organisms, both living and extinct, as described in a famous passage in [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).&lt;ref name="Mindell 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mindell |first=D.

Tree diagrams originated in the [[Middle Ages |medieval era]] to represent [[family tree |genealogical relationships]]. [[Phylogenetic tree]] diagrams in the evolutionary sense date back to the mid-nineteenth century.

The term [[phylogeny]] for the evolutionary relationships of species through time was coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], who went further than [[Charles Darwin |Darwin]] in proposing [[Phylogenetics |phylogenic]] histories of life. In contemporary usage, ''tree of life'' refers to the compilation of comprehensive phylogenetic databases rooted at the [[last universal common ancestor]] of life on Earth. Two public databases for the tree of life are ''TimeTree'', for phylogeny and divergence times, and the ''[[Open Tree of Life]]'', for phylogeny.

{{further|History of evolutionary thought}}

Although tree-like diagrams have long been used to organize knowledge, and although branching diagrams known as ''claves'' ("keys") were omnipresent in eighteenth-century [[natural history]], it appears that the earliest tree diagram of natural order was the 1801 "Arbre botanique" (Botanical Tree) of the French schoolteacher and Catholic priest [[Augustin Augier]].&lt;ref name="Hellström 2019"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hellström |first=Petter |url=https://www.academia.edu/40660349 |title=Trees of Knowledge.

In 1840, the American geologist [[Edward Hitchcock]] (1793–1864) published the first tree-like [[paleontology]] chart in his ''Elementary Geology'', with two separate trees for the plants and the animals.

The first edition of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', published anonymously in 1844 in England, contained a tree-like diagram in the chapter "Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms".{{sfnp |Chambers |1844 |p=[https://archive.org/details/vestigesofnatura00unse/page/212 212]}} It shows a model of [[Embryology|embryological]] development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M).

== Model of evolution ==

{{further|Evolution}}

=== Darwin ===

{{further|Common descent}}

[[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) used the metaphor of a "tree of life" to conceptualize his theory of evolution. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large [[genus]] (see figure). On the horizontal base line hypothetical species within this genus are labelled A – L and are spaced irregularly to indicate how distinct they are from each other, and are above broken lines at various angles suggesting that they have diverged from one or more common ancestors. On the vertical axis divisions labelled I – XIV each represent a thousand generations. From A, diverging lines show branching descent producing new varieties, some of which become extinct, so that after ten thousand generations descendants of A have become distinct new varieties or even sub-species a&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, f&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, and m&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the descendants of I have diversified to become the new varieties w&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; and z&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. The process is extrapolated for a further four thousand generations so that the descendants of A and I become fourteen new species labelled a&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to z&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. While F has continued for fourteen thousand generations relatively unchanged, species B,C,D,E,G,H,K and L have gone extinct. In Darwin's own words: "Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera."{{sfnp|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=131 116–130]}} This is a branching pattern with no names given to species, unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later (figure below) which includes the names of species and shows a more linear development from "lower" to "higher" species. In his summary to the section, Darwin put his concept in terms of the metaphor of the tree of life:

{{blockquote|The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the [[Platypus|Ornithorhynchus]] or [[South American Lungfish|Lepidosiren]], which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a [[ecological niche|protected station]]. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], 1859.{{sfnp|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=147&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 129–130]}}}}

The meaning and importance of Darwin's use of the tree of life metaphor have been extensively discussed by scientists and scholars. [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for one, has argued that Darwin placed the famous passage quoted above "at a crucial spot in his text", where it marked the conclusion of his argument for natural selection, illustrating both the interconnectedness by descent of organisms as well as their success and failure in the history of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1993 |title=Eight Little Piggies |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |isbn=978-0-224-03716-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/eightlittlepiggi0000goul }} p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Penny]] has written that Darwin did not use the tree of life to describe the relationship between groups of organisms, but to suggest that, as with branches in a living tree, lineages of species competed with and supplanted one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penny |first=D. |year=2011 |title=Darwin's Theory of Descent with Modification, versus the Biblical Tree of Life |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=9 |issue=7 |page=e1001096 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001096 |pmid=21750664 |pmc=3130011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Hellström has argued that Darwin consciously named his tree after the biblical [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of Life]], as described in [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]], thus relating his theory to the religious tradition.&lt;ref name="Hellström 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hellström |first1=Petter |year=2012 |title=Darwin and the Tree of Life: The Roots the Evolutionary Tree |url=https://www.academia.edu/4613148 |journal=Archives of Natural History |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=234–252 |doi=10.3366/anh.2012.0092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haeckel ===

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) constructed several trees of life. His first sketch, in the 1860s, shows "''Pithecanthropus alalus''" as the ancestor of ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gliboff |first=Sander |title=Ascent, Descent, and Divergence: Darwin and Haeckel on the Human Family Tree |journal=Konturen |date=2014 |volume=6 |url=http://journals.oregondigital.org/konturen/article/view/3523/3284}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1866 tree of life from ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' shows three kingdoms: Plantae, Protista and Animalia.

==Developments since 1990==

{{further|Kingdom (biology)}}

In 1990, [[Carl Woese]], [[Otto Kandler]] and Mark Wheelis proposed a "tree of life" consisting of three lines of descent for which they introduced the term [[Domain (biology)|domain]] as the highest rank of classification. They also suggested the terms [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[Eukaryote|eukaryota]] for the three domains.&lt;ref name="Woese_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woese | first1 = Carl R.| author-link1 = Carl Woese | last2 =  Kandler | first2 = O | last3 = Wheelis | first3= M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the first draft of the [[Open Tree of Life]] was published, in which information from nearly 500 previously published trees was combined into a single online database, free to browse and download.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.science.org/content/article/first-comprehensive-tree-life-shows-how-related-you-are-millions-species First comprehensive tree of life shows how related you are to millions of species"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another database, ''TimeTree'', helps biologists to evaluate phylogeny and divergence times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TimeTree of Life |url=http://www.timetree.org/ |website=Timetree.org |access-date=27 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, a new tree of life, summarizing the [[evolution]] of all known [[life forms]], was published, illustrating the latest [[gene]]tic findings that the branches were mainly composed of bacteria. The new study incorporated over a thousand newly discovered bacteria and archaea.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160411"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Zimmer |date=11 April 2016 |title=Scientists Unveil New 'Tree of Life' |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/science/scientists-unveil-new-tree-of-life.html |access-date=11 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TS-20160411"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Taylor |first=Ashley P. |title=Branching Out: Researchers create a new tree of life, largely {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} mystery bacteria |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45793/title/Branching-Out/ |date=11 April 2016 |work=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |access-date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NM-20160411"/&gt;

'''''Trichoderma asperellum''''' Samuels, Lieckf &amp; Nirenberg &lt;ref&gt;Samuels, G.J.; Lieckfeldt, E.; Nirenberg, H.I. (1999) ''Trichoderma asperellum'', a new species with warted conidia, and redescription of ''T. viride''. ''Sydowia'' '''51(1)''':71–88&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Hypocreaceae]].&lt;ref name="COL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life: 2011 Annual Checklist.|url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2011/search/all/key/trichoderma+asperellum/match/1|author=Roskov Y.|author2= Kunze T.|author3=Orrell T.|author4=Abucay L.|author5=Paglinawan L.|author6=Culham A.|author7=Bailly N.|author8=Kirk P.|author9=Bourgoin T.|author10=Baillargeon G.|author11=Decock W.|author12=De Wever A.|editor=Didžiulis V.|publisher=Species 2000: Reading, UK.|year=2011|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be distinguished from ''T. viride'' by molecular and phenotypic characteristics. The most important molecular characteristics are divergent ITS-1 and 28S sequences and RFLP's of the endochitinase gene. Main phenotypic characters are conidial ornamentation and arrangement and branching of the conidiophores.

==Important Isolates==
This species has been used commercially and experimentally as a [[biopesticide]] for [[plant disease]] control: some commercial isolates were previously placed in ''[[Trichoderma harzianum|T. harzianum]]''.

'''Troglomorphism''' is the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] adaptation of an animal to living in the constant darkness of caves, characterised by features such as loss of pigment, reduced eyesight or blindness, and frequently with attenuated bodies and/or appendages. The terms [[Troglobite|troglobitic]], stygobitic, [[stygofauna]], [[troglofauna]], and [[Hypogeal|hypogean]] or hypogeic, are often used for cave-dwelling organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/glossary/Glossary.php?q=troglomorphic|title=FishBase Glossary|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by a team from the [[National University of Singapore]] found that reductive changes in freshwater cave crabs evolved at the same rate as constructive changes. This shows that both [[natural selection|selection]] and [[evolution]] have a role in advancing reductive changes (e.g smaller eyes) and constructive changes (e.g larger claws), making troglomorphic adaptations subject to strong factors that affect an organism's morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klaus|first=S.|author2=Mendoza, J. C. E. |author3=Liew, J. H. |author4=Plath, M. |author5=Meier, R. |author6= Yeo, D. C. J. |title=Rapid evolution of troglomorphic characters suggests selection rather than neutral mutation as a driver of eye reduction in cave crabs|journal=Biology Letters|date=2013|volume=9|issue=2|pages=20121098–20121098|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.1098 |pmid=23345534 |pmc=3639761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troglomorphism occurs in molluscs, [[velvet worm]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[myriapods]], crustaceans, insects, [[Cavefish|fish]], amphibians (notably [[cave salamander]]s) and reptiles. To date no mammals or birds have been found to live exclusively in caves. [[Pickerel frog]]s are classed as either [[trogloxene]]s, or possibly [[troglophile]]s.

'''Tropical vegetation''' is any [[vegetation]] in [[tropical]] [[latitude]]s. Plant life that occurs in climates that are warm year-round is in general more biologically diverse that in other latitudes. Some tropical areas may receive abundant rain the whole year round, but others have long [[dry season]]s which last several months and may vary in length and intensity with geographic location. These seasonal [[drought]]s have great impact on the vegetation, such as in the [[Madagascar spiny forests]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060112035906.htm 2006-01-13, Sciencedaily: Deep-rooted Plants Have Much Greater Impact On Climate Than Experts Thought]&lt;/ref&gt; Rainforest vegetation is categorized by five layers.  The top layer being the upper tree layer.  Here you will find the largest and widest trees in all the forest.  These trees tend to have very large canopy's so they can be fully exposed to sunlight.  A layer below that is the middle tree layer.  Here you will find more compact trees and vegetation.  These trees tend to be more skinny as they are trying to gain any sunlight they can. The third layer is the lower tree area.  These trees tend to be around five to ten meters high and tightly compacted. The trees found in the third layer are young trees trying to grow into the larger canopy trees. The fourth layer is the shrub layer beneath the tree canopy. This layer is mainly populated by sapling trees, shrubs, and seedlings. The fifth and final layer is the herb layer which is the forest floor.  The forest floor is mainly bare except for various plants, mosses, and ferns. The forest floor is much more dense than above because of little sunlight and air movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Chris|title=Tropical Rainforest|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0-415-06238-1|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tropicalrainfore00park/page/17 17-18]|url=https://archive.org/details/tropicalrainfore00park/page/17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant species native to the tropics found in tropical [[ecosystem]]s are known as tropical plants. Some examples of tropical ecosystem are the [[Guinean Forests of West Africa]], the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] and the broadleaf forests of the [[Thai highlands]] and the [[El Yunque National Forest]] in the [[Puerto Rico]].

==Description==
{{See also|Tropical ecology|Tropical climate}}
The term "tropical vegetation" is frequently used in the sense of lush and luxuriant, but not all the vegetation of the areas of the Earth in [[tropical climate]]s can be defined as such. Despite lush vegetation, often the soils of [[tropical forests]] are low in [[nutrient]]s making them quite vulnerable to [[slash-and-burn]] [[deforestation]] techniques, which are sometimes an element of [[shifting cultivation]] agricultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation|work=UN Secretary-General's Report| url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tropical vegetation may include the following habitat types:

===Tropical rainforest===
[[Tropical rainforest]] ecosystems include significant areas of [[biodiversity]], often coupled with high species [[endemism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/rainforests/explore/facts.html Facts about the world's tropical rainforests] from [[The Nature Conservancy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rainforests are home to half of all the living animal and plant species on the planet and roughly two-thirds of all flowering plants can be found in rainforests.&lt;ref name="MI"&gt;The Regents of the [[University of Michigan]]. [http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/kling/rainforest/rainforest.html The Tropical Rain Forest.] Retrieved on 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newman, Arnold 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Arnold|title=Tropical Rainforest: Our Most Valuable and Endangered Habitat With a Blueprint for Its Survival Into the Third Millennium|year=2002|publisher=Checkmark|isbn=0816039739|edition=2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tropicalrainfore00newm_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most representative are the [[Borneo]] rainforest, one of the oldest rainforests in the world, the [[Brazil]]ian and [[Venezuela]]n [[Amazon Rainforest]], as well as the eastern [[Costa Paulo]]n rainforests.

===Tropical seasonal forest===
[[Seasonal tropical forest]]s generally receive high total rainfall, averaging more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm per year, but with a distinct [[dry season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0103.htm Types of rainforests]&lt;/ref&gt; They include: the [[Congolian forests]], a broad belt of highland [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] which extends across the basin of the [[Congo River]]; Central American tropical forests in [[Geography of Panama#Fauna and flora|Panama]] and [[Nicaragua]]; the seasonal forests that predominate across much the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Indochina]], and northern Australia: [[Wet Tropics of Queensland|Queensland]].

===Tropical dry broadleaf forest===
[[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical dry broadleaf forests]] are territories with a forest cover that is not very dense and has often an unkempt, irregular appearance, especially in the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/selecting_terrestrial_ecoregions/habitat02.cfm |title=WWF - Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forest Ecoregions |publisher=Wwf.panda.org |accessdate=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425205410/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/selecting_terrestrial_ecoregions/habitat02.cfm |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of forest often includes [[bamboo]] and [[teak]] as the dominant large tree species, such as in the [[Phi Pan Nam Range]], part of the [[Central Indochina dry forests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=THA+02 UNESCO - MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory - Huai Tak Teak Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt; They are affected by often long seasonal dry periods and, though less biologically diverse than rainforests, tropical dry forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife.

===Tropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands===
[[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|Tropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]]&lt;ref name="grass"&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/habitats/grasslands/ WWF - Grasslands]&lt;/ref&gt; are spread over a large area of the tropics with a vegetation made up mainly of low [[shrub]]s and [[grass]]es, often including [[sclerophyll]] species.&lt;ref name="grass"/&gt; Some of the most representative are the [[Western Zambezian grasslands]] in [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]], as well as the [[Einasleigh upland savanna]] in [[Australia]] and the [[Everglades]] in [[United States of America]]. Tree species such as [[Acacia]] and [[baobab]] may be present in these ecosystems depending on the region.

When this type of bacteria is administered into the body it migrates to the cancerous tissues and starts to grow, then deploys distinct mechanisms to destroy solid tumors.

Different strains of tumor homing bacteria in distinct environments use unique or similar processes to inhibit or destroy tumor growth.[[File:Mechanisms by which bacteria target tumors.svg|thumb|Mechanisms by which bacteria target tumors.]]

=== Unique Mechanisms ===

* ''Salmonella'' bacteria kill tumor cells by uncontrolled bacterial multiplication that can lead to the bursting of cancerous cells. Moreover, the [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s (type of white blood cells) in these ''Salmonella''-colonized tumors secrete [[Interleukin 1 beta|IL-1β]], a protein responsible for anti-tumor activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jung-Eun|last2=Phan|first2=Thuy Xuan|last3=Nguyen|first3=Vu Hong|last4=Dinh-Vu|first4=Hong-Van|last5=Zheng|first5=Jin Hai|last6=Yun|first6=Misun|last7=Park|first7=Sung-Gyoo|last8=Hong|first8=Yeongjin|last9=Choy|first9=Hyon E.|last10=Szardenings|first10=Michael|last11=Hwang|first11=Won|date=2015|title=Salmonella typhimurium Suppresses Tumor Growth via the Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Interleukin-1β|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26516371/|journal=Theranostics|volume=5|issue=12|pages=1328–1342|doi=10.7150/thno.11432|issn=1838-7640|pmc=4615736|pmid=26516371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''S. Typhimurium'' flagellin increases both [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]] (nonspecific and specific defense mechanisms) of the bacteria by stimulating [[Natural killer cell|NK cells]] (Natural Killer cells) to produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ), an important [[cytokine]] (regulatory protein) for this immunity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ''Listeria'' inhibits tumors through [[NADPH oxidase]] mediated production (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase) of [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] (reactive oxygen species) which is a cell signaling process that activates [[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T cells]] (cells that kill cancerous tissue) which target primary tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Sun Hee|last2=Castro|first2=Francisco|last3=Paterson|first3=Yvonne|last4=Gravekamp|first4=Claudia|date=2009-07-15|title=High Efficacy of a Listeria-Based Vaccine against Metastatic Breast Cancer Reveals a Dual Mode of Action|url= |journal=Cancer Research|language=en|volume=69|issue=14|pages=5860–5866|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4855|issn=0008-5472|pmid=19584282|pmc=3127451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similar Mechanisms ===

* ''Clostridium, S. Typhimurium, Listeria'' produce [[exotoxin]]s (e.g. [[phospholipase]]s, [[hemolysin]]s, [[lipase]]s) that damage the membrane structure and the cellular functions of the tumor using [[apoptosis]] or [[autophagy]] which is programmed cell death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* ''Salmonella, Clostridium,'' and ''Listeria'' infections promote tumor elimination by increasing [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s (cell signaling regulatory proteins) that regulate infected sites using [[granulocyte]]s and [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic lymphocytes]] ([[White blood cell|WBC]] s that kill cancerous cells).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Confirmed Medical Treatments ==
Bacterial cancer therapy is an emerging field for cancer treatment. Although many clinical trials are taking place, as of right now only a few confirmed treatments are being administered to patients.

=== Treatment with Live Strains of Bacteria ===

* The usage of the live attenuated strain of [[Mycobacterium bovis|Mycobacterium Bovis]], also known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is a confirmed treatment for [[bladder cancer]]. BCG therapy is done by intravesical instillation (drug administration into the urinary bladder via a catheter) and has been used since 1970 on cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Torres|first1=Wheeler|last2=Lameda|first2=Víctor|last3=Olivar|first3=Luis Carlos|last4=Navarro|first4=Carla|last5=Fuenmayor|first5=Jorge|last6=Pérez|first6=Adrián|last7=Mindiola|first7=Andres|last8=Rojas|first8=Milagros|last9=Martínez|first9=María Sofía|last10=Velasco|first10=Manuel|last11=Rojas|first11=Joselyn|date=2018-01-24|title=Bacteria in cancer therapy: beyond immunostimulation|url=https://jcmtjournal.com/article/view/2365|journal=Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment|language=en-us|volume=4|page=4|doi=10.20517/2394-4722.2017.49|issn=2394-4722|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to the necrotic and hypoxic regions of tumor cells (area of treatment resistance), drug delivery of [[chemotherapy]] can be impaired. Therefore ''Salmonella'' can be combined with chemotherapy to provide treatment and transport as ''Salmonella'' is not affected by these regions. Moreover, the ''Salmonella'' mutant strain VNP20009 increased in number from this combination which causes further inhibition of cancerous cells by stimulating anti-tumor proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mi|first1=Ze|last2=Feng|first2=Zhi-Chao|last3=Li|first3=Cheng|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao|last5=Ma|first5=Meng-Tian|last6=Rong|first6=Peng-Fei|date=2019-08-20|title=Salmonella-Mediated Cancer Therapy: An Innovative Therapeutic Strategy|journal=Journal of Cancer|volume=10|issue=20|pages=4765–4776|doi=10.7150/jca.32650|issn=1837-9664|pmc=6775532|pmid=31598148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment with Genetically Engineered Bacteria ===
Tumor homing bacteria can be genetically engineered to enhance their anti-tumor activities and be used to transport therapeutic materials based on medical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sieow |first1=Brendan Fu-Long |last2=Wun |first2=Kwok Soon |last3=Yong |first3=Wei Peng |last4=Hwang |first4=In Young |last5=Chang |first5=Matthew Wook |title=Tweak to Treat: Reprograming Bacteria for Cancer Treatment |journal=Trends in Cancer |date=December 2020 |doi=10.1016/j.trecan.2020.11.004 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2020.11.004 |issn=2405-8033|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually transformed into a [[plasmid]] that contains the specific gene expression of these therapeutic proteins of the bacteria. After the plasmid reaches the target site, the protein’s genetic sequence is expressed and the bacteria can have its full biological effect. Currently, there is no approved treatment with genetically engineered bacteria. However, research is being conducted on ''Listeria'' and ''Clostridium'' as vectors to transport [[RNA interference|RNAi]] (suppresses genes) for [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chien|first1=Tiffany|last2=Doshi|first2=Anjali|last3=Danino|first3=Tal|date=October 2017|title=Advances in bacterial cancer therapies using synthetic biology|journal=Current Opinion in Systems Biology|volume=5|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.coisb.2017.05.009|issn=2452-3100|pmc=5986102|pmid=29881788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety of Bacterial Cancer Therapy ==
Some active tumor homing bacteria can be harmful to the human body since they produce toxins that disturb the [[cell cycle]] which results in altered cell growth and chronic infections. However, many ways to enhance the safety of tumor homing bacteria in the body has been found. For example, when the virulent genes of the bacteria are removed by [[gene targeting]], a process where genes are deleted or modified, it can be reduced in [[pathogen]]icity (property of causing disease).

=== Adverse Effects ===

* [[Mutation|DNA mutations]] of the tumor homing bacteria in the body can lead to problems like extreme infection and failure of therapy as the genes that are expressed will be different and cause the bacteria to become non-functional.
* Incomplete tumor [[lysis]] or colonization by the bacteria can lead to delayed treatment and will necessitate the use of other cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or a combination of more. Delayed or combined treatment causes many effects on the body such as vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, and hair loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Patyar|first1=S|last2=Joshi|first2=R|last3=Byrav|first3=DS Prasad|last4=Prakash|first4=A|last5=Medhi|first5=B|last6=Das|first6=BK|date=2010-03-23|title=Bacteria in cancer therapy: a novel experimental strategy|journal=Journal of Biomedical Science|volume=17|issue=1|pages=21|doi=10.1186/1423-0127-17-21|issn=1021-7770|pmc=2854109|pmid=20331869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention of Adverse Effects ===

* Deleting the ''[[MSMB|msbB]] gene'' from ''Salmonella'' by genetic engineering leads to the loss of [[lipid A]] (a lipid responsible for the toxicity levels of [[gram-negative bacteria]]) and therefore reduces the toxicity of ''Salmonella'' by 10,000-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Toso|first1=John F.|last2=Gill|first2=Vee J.|last3=Hwu|first3=Patrick|last4=Marincola|first4=Francesco M.|last5=Restifo|first5=Nicholas P.|last6=Schwartzentruber|first6=Douglas J.|last7=Sherry|first7=Richard M.|last8=Topalian|first8=Suzanne L.|last9=Yang|first9=James C.|last10=Stock|first10=Frida|last11=Freezer|first11=Linda J.|date=2002-01-01|title=Phase I Study of the Intravenous Administration of Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium to Patients With Metastatic Melanoma|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=20|issue=1|pages=142–152|doi=10.1200/JCO.2002.20.1.142|issn=0732-183X|pmc=2064865|pmid=11773163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Generating [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophic mutants]] (a strain of microorganism that will proliferate only when the medium is supplemented with some specific substance) that cannot replicate efficiently in an environment where a particular nutrient required by the mutant strain is scarce. ''Salmonella A1-R'' represents such a strain, which is auxotrophic for the amino acids [[leucine]] and [[arginine]] that are enriched in the tumor but not in normal tissues. Therefore in the tumor, ''Salmonella A1-R'' will grow but not in the normal tissues thereby preventing infections and increasing safety.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Research ==
The most researched bacteria for cancer therapy are ''Salmonella'', ''Listeria,'' and ''Clostridium.'' A genetically engineered strain of ''Salmonella'' (TAPET-CD) has completed phase 1 clinical trials for patients with stage 4 metastatic cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=C.|last2=Nemunaitis|first2=J.|date=2001-08-10|title=A phase I trial of genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium expressing cytosine deaminase (TAPET-CD, VNP20029) administered by intratumoral injection in combination with 5-fluorocytosine for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.

[[File:TuringPattern.PNG|thumb|320px|Three examples of Turing patterns]]
[[File:Six States - Turing Patterns.jpg|thumb|320px|Six states generating a Turing pattern]]

The '''Turing pattern''' is a concept introduced by English mathematician [[Alan Turing]] in a 1952 paper titled "[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]" which describes how [[patterns in nature]], such as stripes and spots, can arise naturally and autonomously from a homogeneous, uniform state.&lt;ref name="turing52"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Turing | first1=Alan | author-link=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B]] | volume=237 | issue=641 | pages=37–72 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | url=http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf | jstor=92463 | date=1952 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T | s2cid=120437796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Life's Other Secret: The New Mathematics of the Living World | first=Ian | last=Stewart | authorlink=Ian Stewart (mathematician) | publisher=[[Allen Lane]]: [[The Penguin Press]] | isbn=0-713-99161-5 | date=1998 | pages=138–140, 142–146, 148, 149, 151, 152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In his classic paper,&lt;ref name="turing52" /&gt; Turing examined the behaviour of a system in which two diffusible substances interact with each other, and found that such a system is able to generate a spatially periodic pattern even from a random or almost uniform initial condition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kondo|first=Shigeru|date=2017-02-07|title=An updated kernel-based Turing model for studying the mechanisms of biological pattern formation|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=414|pages=120–127|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.11.003|pmid=27838459|bibcode=2017JThBi.414..120K|issn=0022-5193|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the discovery of this instability mechanism arising due to unequal diffusion coefficients of the two substances, diffusional effects are always presumed to have stabilizing influences on the system. 

Turing hypothesized that the resulting wavelike patterns are the chemical basis of [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Turing patterning is often found in combination with other patterns: vertebrate [[limb development]] is one of the many [[phenotypes]] exhibiting Turing patterning overlapped with a complementary pattern (in this case a [[French flag model]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Sharpe | first1=James | last2=Green | first2=Jeremy | title=Positional information and reaction-diffusion: two big ideas in developmental biology combine | journal=Development | volume=142 | pages=1203–1211 | doi=10.1242/dev.114991 | url=https://dev.biologists.org/content/142/7/1203 | date=2015 | issue=7 | pmid=25804733 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Turing, [[Yakov Zeldovich]] in 1944 discovered this instability mechanism in connection with the cellular structures observed in lean [[hydrogen]] flames.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldovich, Y. B. (1944). Theory of Combustion and Detonation of Gases. Selected Works of Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich, Volume I: Chemical Physics and Hydrodynamics (pp. 162-232). Princeton: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Zeldovich explained the cellular structure as a consequence of hydrogen's diffusion coefficient being larger than the [[thermal diffusivity|thermal diffusion coefficient]]. In [[combustion]] literature, Turing instability is referred to as [[diffusive–thermal instability]].

The original theory, a [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion]] theory of morphogenesis, has served as an important model in [[theoretical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=L. G. | last=Harrison | title=Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern | journal=Endeavour | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1993 | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=130–6 | doi=10.1016/0160-9327(95)90520-5 | pmid=7851310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction–diffusion systems have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. Patterns such as [[Front (physics)|fronts]], [[hexagon]]s, [[spiral]]s, [[Stripe (pattern)|stripes]] and [[dissipative soliton]]s are found as solutions of Turing-like [[reaction–diffusion equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kondo |first1=S. |last2=Miura |first2=T. |title=Reaction-Diffusion Model as a Framework for Understanding Biological Pattern Formation |journal=Science |date=23 September 2010 |volume=329 |issue=5999 |pages=1616–1620 |doi=10.1126/science.1179047|pmid=20929839 |bibcode=2010Sci...329.1616K |s2cid=10194433 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3296c877ed52b3961990507714b434058977ec9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing proposed a model wherein two homogeneously distributed substances (P and S) interact to produce stable patterns during morphogenesis. These patterns represent regional differences in the concentrations of the two substances. Their interactions would produce an ordered structure out of random chaos.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gilbert, Scott F., 1949-|title=Developmental biology|year=2014|isbn=978-0-87893-978-7|edition=Tenth|location=Sunderland, MA, USA|oclc=837923468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turing's model, substance P promotes the production of more substance P as well as substance S. However, substance S inhibits the production of substance P; if S diffuses more readily than P, sharp waves of concentration differences will be generated for substance P. An important feature of Turing´s model is that particular wavelengths in the substances' distribution will be amplified while other wavelengths will be suppressed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The parameters depend on the physical system under consideration. In the context of fish skin pigmentation, the associated equation is a three field reaction–diffusion one in which the linear parameters are associated with pigmentation cell concentration and the diffusion parameters are not the same for all fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakamasu |first1=A. |last2=Takahashi |first2=G. |last3=Kanbe |first3=A. |last4=Kondo |first4=S. |title=Interactions between zebrafish pigment cells responsible for the generation of Turing patterns |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=11 May 2009 |volume=106 |issue=21 |pages=8429–8434 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0808622106|pmid=19433782 |pmc=2689028 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.8429N |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In dye-doped [[liquid crystals]], a photoisomerization process in the liquid crystal matrix is described as a reaction–diffusion equation of two fields (liquid crystal order parameter and concentration of cis-isomer of the azo-dye).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrade-Silva |first1=Ignacio |last2=Bortolozzo |first2=Umberto |last3=Clerc |first3=Marcel G. |last4=González-Cortés |first4=Gregorio |last5=Residori |first5=Stefania |last6=Wilson |first6=Mario |title=Spontaneous light-induced Turing patterns in a dye-doped twisted nematic layer |journal=Scientific Reports |date=27 August 2018 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=12867 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-31206-x|pmid=30150701 |pmc=6110868 |bibcode=2018NatSR...812867A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The systems have very different physical mechanisms on the chemical reactions and diffusive process, but on a phenomenological level, both have the same ingredients.

Turing-like patterns have also been demonstrated to arise in developing organisms without the classical requirement of diffusible morphogens. Studies in chick and mouse embryonic development suggest that the patterns of feather and hair-follicle precursors can be formed without a morphogen pre-pattern, and instead are generated through self-aggregation of mesenchymal cells underlying the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glover | first1 = James D. | last2 = Wells | first2 = Kirsty L. | last3 = Matthäus | first3 = Franziska | last4 = Painter | first4 = Kevin J. | last5 = Ho | first5 = William | last6 = Riddell | first6 = Jon | last7 = Johansson | first7 = Jeanette A. | last8 = Ford | first8 = Matthew J. | last9 = Jahoda | first9 = Colin A.

Regular patterns of cell aggregates of this sort were originally proposed in a theoretical model formulated by George Oster, which postulated that alterations in cellular motility and stiffness could give rise to different self-emergent patterns from a uniform field of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oster | first1 = G. F. | last2 = Murray | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Harris | first3 = A. K. | year = 1983 | title = Mechanical aspects of mesenchymal morphogenesis | journal = Journal of Embryology and Experimental Morphology | volume = 78 | pages = 83–125 | pmid = 6663234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of pattern formation may act in tandem with classical reaction-diffusion systems, or independently to generate patterns in biological development.

As well as in biological organisms, Turing patterns occur in other natural systems – for example, the wind patterns formed in sand, the atomic-scale repetitive ripples that can form during growth of bismuth crystals, and the uneven distribution of matter in [[galactic disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fuseya|first1=Yuki|last2=Katsuno|first2=Hiroyasu|last3=Behnia|first3=Kamran|last4=Kapitulnik|first4=Aharon|date=2021-07-08|title=Nanoscale Turing patterns in a bismuth monolayer|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01288-y|journal=Nature Physics|volume=17|issue=9|language=en|pages=1031–1036|doi=10.1038/s41567-021-01288-y|arxiv=2104.01058 |bibcode=2021NatPh..17.1031F|s2cid=237767233|issn=1745-2481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Smolin|first=Lee|date=1996-12-03|title=Galactic disks as reaction-diffusion systems|eprint=astro-ph/9612033|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Turing's ideas on morphogenesis and Turing patterns remained dormant for many years, they are now inspirational for much research in [[mathematical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, T. E., [[Ruth Baker|Baker, R. E.]], [[Philip Maini|Maini, P. K.]], Chapter 34, ''Turing's theory of morphogenesis''. In {{cite book |author-link1 = Jack Copeland|last1 = Copeland | first1=B.

Turing patterns can also be created in nonlinear optics as demonstrated by the [[Lugiato–Lefever equation]].

A mechanism that has gained increasing attention as a generator of spot- and stripe-like patterns in developmental systems is related to the chemical reaction-diffusion process described by Turing in 1952. This has been schematized in a biological "local autoactivation-lateral inhibition" (LALI) framework by Meinhardt and Gierer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Meinhardt|first=Hans|title=Multiscale Modeling of Developmental Systems|chapter=Models of Biological Pattern Formation: From Elementary Steps to the Organization of Embryonic Axes|date=2008|series=Current Topics in Developmental Biology|volume=81|pages=1–63|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0070-2153(07)81001-5|pmid=18023723|isbn=978-0-12-374253-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; LALI systems, while formally similar to reaction-diffusion systems, are more suitable to biological applications, since they include cases where the activator and inhibitor terms are mediated by cellular ‘‘reactors’’ rather than simple chemical reactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hentschel|first1=H.

Reaction-diffusion models can be used to forecast the exact location of the tooth cusps in mice and voles based on differences in gene expression patterns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The model can be used to explain the differences in gene expression between mice and vole teeth, the signaling center of the tooth, enamel knot, secrets BMPs, FGFs and Shh. Shh and FGF inhibits BMP production, while BMP stimulates both the production of more BMPs and the synthesis of their own inhibitors. BMPs also induce epithelial differentiation, while FGFs induce epithelial growth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Salazar-Ciudad|first1=Isaac|last2=Jernvall|first2=Jukka|date=March 2010|title=A computational model of teeth and the developmental origins of morphological variation|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08838|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=464|issue=7288|pages=583–586|doi=10.1038/nature08838|pmid=20220757|bibcode=2010Natur.464..583S|s2cid=323733|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a pattern of gene activity that changes as the shape of the tooth changes, and vice versa. Under this model, the large differences between mouse and vole molars can be generated by small changes in the binding constants and diffusion rates of the BMP and Shh proteins. A small increase in the diffusion rate of BMP4 and a stronger binding constant of its inhibitor is sufficient to change the vole pattern of tooth growth into that of the mouse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Salazar-ciudad|first1=Isaac|last2=Jernvall|first2=Jukka|date=January 2004|title=How different types of pattern formation mechanisms affect the evolution of form and development|journal=Evolution and Development|volume=6|issue=1|pages=6–16|doi=10.1111/j.1525-142x.2004.04002.x|pmid=15108813|s2cid=1783730|issn=1520-541X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Asgards are found to contain genes that codes for several of such unique proteins, indicating that the proteins originated in archaea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
Classification of life into two main divisions is not new and the first was by a French biologist [[Édouard Chatton]]. In 1938, Chatton gave a broad distinction of organisms:

# Procaryotes (that include bacteria)
# Eucaryotes (that include protozoans)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Katscher |first=Friedrich |date=2004 |title=The History of the Terms Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1434461004701820 |journal=Protist |language=en |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=257–263 |doi=10.1078/143446104774199637|pmid=15305800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were later named empires, and Chatton's classification as the [[two-empire system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |date=1998 |title=Two empires or three? |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=95 |issue=17 |pages=9720–9723 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.17.9720 |pmc=33883 |pmid=9707542|bibcode=1998PNAS...95.9720M |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatton used the name Eucaryotes only for protozoans, excluded other eukaryotes, and published in limited circulation so that his work was not recognised. His classification was rediscovered by Canadian bacteriologist [[Roger Stanier|Roger Yates Stanier]] of the [[University of California in Berkeley]] in 1961 while staying at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The next year, Stanier and his colleague [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis Bernardus van Niel]] published in ''Archiv für Mikrobiologie'' (now ''[[Archives of Microbiology]]'') Chatton's classification with Eucaryotes eloborated to include higher algae, protozoans, fungi, plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Stanier |first1=R. Y. |last2=Van Niel |first2=C. B. |date=1962 |title=The concept of a bacterium |url=https://fire.biol.wwu.edu/cmoyer/zztemp_fire/biol497_F13/papers/Stanier_archmicro62.pdf |journal=Archiv für Mikrobiologie |volume=42 |pages=17–35 |doi=10.1007/BF00425185 |pmid=13916221|s2cid=29859498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a popular system of classification, as John O. Corliss wrote in 1986: "[The] Chatton-Stanier concept of a [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] (better, superkingdom) Prokaryota for bacteria (in the broadest sense) and a second superkingdom Eukaryota for all other organisms has been widely accepted with enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Corliss |first=John O. |date=1986 |title=The Kingdoms of Organisms: From a Microscopist's Point of View |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3226544 |journal=Transactions of the American Microscopical Society |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.2307/3226544 |jstor=3226544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[Carl Woese]] and [[George E. Fox]] classified prokaryotes into two groups (kingdoms), Archaebacteria (for [[methanogens]], the first known archaea) and Eubacteria, based on their [[16S ribosomal RNA]] (16S rRNA) genes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese CR, Fox GE |date=November 1977 |title=Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: the primary kingdoms |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=5088–90 |bibcode=1977PNAS...74.5088W |doi=10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088 |pmc=432104 |pmid=270744 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[James A.

=== Eukaryotes evolved from archaea ===
The three-domain system presumes that eukaryotes are more closely related to archaea than to bacteria and are sister group to archaea, thus, it treats them as separate domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Eme |first1=Laura |last2=Spang |first2=Anja |last3=Lombard |first3=Jonathan |last4=Stairs |first4=Courtney W. |last5=Ettema |first5=Thijs J.

In 2008, researchers from [[Natural History Museum, London]] and [[Newcastle University]] reported a comprehensive analysis of 53 genes from archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes that included essential components of the nucleic acid replication, transcription, and translation machineries. The conclusion was that eukaryotes evolved from archaea, specifically Crenarchaeota (eocytes) and the results "favor a topology that supports the eocyte hypothesis rather than archaebacterial monophyly and the 3-domains tree of life."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A study around the same time also found several genes that are common to eukaryotes and archaea within the Crenarchaeota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Yutin |first1=Natalya |last2=Makarova |first2=Kira S. |last3=Mekhedov |first3=Sergey L. |last4=Wolf |first4=Yuri I. |last5=Koonin |first5=Eugene V. |date=2008 |title=The deep archaeal roots of eukaryotes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1619–1630 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn108 |pmc=2464739 |pmid=18463089}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accumulating evidences support the two-domain system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One of the distinctions of the domain Eukarya in the three-domain system is that eukaryotes have unique proteins such as [[actin]] ([[Cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal]] [[microfilament]] involved in cell motility), [[tubulin]] (component of the large cytoskeleton, [[microtubule]]) and the [[ubiquitin]] system (protein degradation and recycling) that are not found in prokaryotes. However, these so-called "eukaryotic signature proteins"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are present in TACK (comprising the phyla [[Thaumarchaeota]], [[Aigarchaeota]], Crenarchaeota and [[Korarchaeota]]) archaea but not in other archaea as indicated by genes that codes for such proteins.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first eukaryotic protein identified was actin and actin-related proteins (Arp) 2 and 3 in Crenarchaeota.

== Classification ==
The two-domain system defines classification of all known cellular life forms into two domains: Bacteria and Archaea. It overrides the domain Eukaryota recognised in the three-domain classification as one of the main domains. In contrast to the eocyte hypothesis, which proposed two major groups of life (similar to domains) and posited that archaea could be divided to both bacterial and eukaryotic groups, it merged archaea and eukaryotes into a single domain, bacteria entirely in a separate domain.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Domain Bacteria ===
It consists entirely of all bacteria. All bacteria are prokaryotes (lacking nucleus), thus, the domain is made up of prokaryotic organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hugenholtz |first=Philip |date=2002 |title=Exploring prokaryotic diversity in the genomic era |url=https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-reviews0003 |journal=Genome Biology |language=en |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=reviews0003.1 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-reviews0003 |pmc=139013 |pmid=11864374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Oren |first=Aharon |date=2004 |editor-last=Godfray |editor-first=H.

'''Archaea'''

Archaea are prokaryotic organisms and some examples are:

* Most [[halophiles]] – which live in very salty water.
* Most [[thermoacidophiles]] – which live in acidic high-temperature water.

'''Eukarya'''

Eukaryotes are those having nucleus in their cells, and are classified into four groups:

* [[Protists]] – an informal taxon for unicellular eukaryotes that include malarial parasites, amoeba, and diatoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Adl |first1=Sina M. |last2=Simpson |first2=Alastair G.

[[File:Marocaster coronatus MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2 (Close up).jpg|thumb|right|Type specimen for ''[[Marocaster coronatus]]'']]

In biology, a '''type''' is a particular [[wiktionary:en:specimen|specimen]] (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an [[organism]] to which the [[scientific name]] of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralizes the defining features of that particular [[taxon]]. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock/&gt;

A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a [[species description]]) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{citation |author=Hitchcock, A.S. |year=1921 |title=The Type Concept in Systematic Botany |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=251–255 |jstor=2434993 |doi=10.2307/2434993|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/314424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Dan H.|title=Botanical nomenclature, types, &amp; standard reference works|url=http://botany.si.edu/references/botlinks/dhntyp.htm|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type specimen==
{{Redirect|Type specimen|the mineralogy term|type specimen (mineralogy)}}
According to a precise set of rules laid down in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular ''specimen'', or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a [[museum]] or [[herbarium]] research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.&lt;ref name="MarshallEvenhuis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Evenhuis|first2=Neal L.|last1=Marshall|first1=Stephen A.|title=New species without dead bodies: a case for photo-based descriptions, illustrated by a striking new species of ''Marleyimyia'' Hesse (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from South Africa |journal=[[ZooKeys]] |issue=525 |year=2015 |pages=117–127 |issn=1313-2970 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.525.6143 |pmid=26487819 |pmc=4607853|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]].

When identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa{{clarify|date=April 2020}}{{cn|date=April 2020}}, based on (at least) having read the type description(s){{cn|date=April 2020}}, preferably also based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand, the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

This process is crucial to biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change over time. How do we know that what we call "''[[Canis lupus]]''" is the same thing,  or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling "''Canis lupus''" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115145/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2020}} and everyone who uses that name{{clarify|date=April 2020}}{{cn|date=April 2020}}– no matter what else they may mean by it – will include that particular specimen.{{clarify|date=April 2020}}{{cn|date=April 2020}} 

Depending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an [[Biological illustration|illustration]], or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code, the type is always a specimen or illustration.

For example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the [[spotted harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.

Note that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a "typical" individual to be used. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more "typical" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term [[name-bearing type]] or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define "typical" individuals or [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CANBR&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant names – a basic introduction|url=http://www.cpbr.gov.au/chah/avh/help/names/|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research|access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', type-based definitions are replaced by [[phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definitions]].

==Older terminology==
In some older taxonomic works the word "type" has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first ''Laws of Botanical Nomenclature'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.P.|year=1867|title=Lois de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique tenu à Paris en août 1867 suivies d'une deuxième édition de l'introduction historique et du commentaire qui accompagnaient la rédaction préparatoire présentée à la congrès|publisher=J.-B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|fr|Ce seul caractère permet de distinguer ce type de toutes les autres espèces de la section. … Après avoir étudié ces diverses formes, j'en arrivai à les considérer comme appartenant à un seul et même type spécifique.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Translation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{anchor|botany|Botany}}In botany==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], a ''type'' (''typus'', ''nomenclatural type''), "is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached." (article 7.2)&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, "curated", in a [[herbarium]] (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:
* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make faithful and detailed illustrations. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of taxon.
* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a [[microscope]]. A tiny "plant" on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the "plant" in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006).

Note that a type does not determine the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "big" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "small" species). The name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent to which the name actually applies varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.

Miscellaneous notes:
# Only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For most new [[taxon|taxa]] (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks, a type should not be an illustration.

The ''ICN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of types (article 9 and the Glossary),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

* holotype – the single specimen or illustration that the author(s) clearly indicated to be the nomenclatural type of a name
* lectotype – a specimen or illustration designated from the original material as the nomenclatural type when there was no holotype specified or the holotype has been lost or destroyed
* isotype – a duplicate of the holotype
* syntype  – any specimen (or illustration) cited in the original description when there is no holotype, or any one of two or more specimens simultaneously designated as types
* paratype – any specimen (or illustration) cited in the original description that is not the holotype nor an isotype, nor one of the syntypes
* neotype – a specimen or illustration selected to serve as nomenclatural type if no material from the original description is available
* epitype – a specimen or illustration selected to serve as an interpretative type, usually when another kind of type does not show the critical features needed for identification

Note that the word "type" appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the ''ICN'': for example a clonotype.

==In zoology==

In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen or series of specimens. The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A "name-bearing type" is a specimen or image that "provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined."

===Definitions===
* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen "Neanderthal-1" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.
* A [[type species]] is the [[nominal species]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]].
* A [[type genus]] is the [[nominal genus]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.
* The [[type series]] are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.

===Use of type specimens===
[[File:Mormopterus acetabulosus type illustration.jpg|thumb|Type illustration of ''[[Mormopterus acetabulosus]]'']]
Although in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.

A type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''{{visible anchor|type host}}''' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|jstor=3283335|author1=Frey, Jennifer K. |author2=Yates, Terry L. |author3=Duszynski, Donald W. |author4=Gannon, William L. |author5=Gardner, Scott L. |name-list-style=amp |journal=The Journal of Parasitology| volume=78|issue=5|year=1992| pages=930–993|s2cid=82003952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other "type" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:

====Holotype====
{{main|Holotype}}
When a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the ''holotype'' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.

====Paratype====
{{main|Paratype}}
When the original description designated a holotype, there may be additional specimens that the author designates as additional representatives of the same species, termed paratypes. These are not [[name-bearing type]]s.

====Allotype====
An allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. The word was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"/&gt; The term is not regulated by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].

====Neotype====
A neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.

====Syntype====
{{Main|Syntype}}
A syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.

====Lectotype====
A lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of [[syntype]]s.
In zoology, a lectotype is a kind of [[name-bearing type]]. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.

A notable example is a suggestion that [[Carl Linnaeus]] should constitute the lectotype for the species ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stearn|first=W. T.|date=1959-03-01|title=The Background of Linnaeus's Contributions to the Nomenclature and Methods of Systematic Biology|journal=Systematic Biology|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=10.2307/sysbio/8.1.4|issn=1063-5157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paralectotype====
A paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hansen, Hans V. |author2=Seberg, Ole |title=Paralectotype, a new type term in botany |journal=Taxon |year=1984 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=707–711 |jstor=1220790 |doi=10.2307/1220790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hapantotype====
A special case in [[Protistan]]s where the type consists of two or more specimens of "directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.

==== Iconotype ====
An illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese python, ''[[Burmese python|Python bivittatus]],'' is one of many species that are based on illustrations by [[Albertus Seba]] (1734).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/62760#/summary|title=Locupletissimi Rerum naturalium Thesauri accurata Descriptio, et Iconibus artificiosissimus Expressio, per universam Physices Historiam. Opus, cui in hoc Rerum Genere, nullum par exstitit.|last=Seba|first=Albertus|publisher=Janssonio-Waesbergios|year=1734|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Aaron M.|date=2002|title=Albertus Seba, Cabinet of Natural Curiosities. The Complete Plates in Colour, 1734–1765. 2001.|journal=International Society for the History and Bibliography of Herpetology|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ergatotype====
An ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in [[hymenopteran]]s which have polymorphic castes.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawksworth |first=D.L. |title=Terms Used in Bionomenclature. The naming of organisms (and plant communities) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Biodiversity Information Facility |location=Copenhagen |isbn=978-87-92020-09-3 |pages=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qky7_6-UcQQC&amp;q=ergatotype&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternatives to preserved specimens====
Type illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the [[Réunion parakeet]], which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=Julian Pender|title=Reappraisal of the parrots (Aves: Psittacidae) from the Mascarene Islands, with comments on their ecology, morphology, and affinities|url=http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|date=25 June 2007|volume=1513|access-date=13 January 2011|issn=1175-5334|issue=1513|pages=1–76|doi=10.11646/zootaxa.1513.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

Recently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (a [[bushshrike]]), described as ''Laniarius liberatus'', in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary for the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should dispute about the validity of a species arise.

====Formalisation of the type system====
The various types listed above are necessary{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in the destruction of the original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.

The ICZN has existed only since 1961 when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many "type-less" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is "an exceptional need" for "clarifying the taxonomic status" of a species (Article 75.2).

There are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix "-type" (e.g., [[allotype (nomenclature)|allotype]], cotype, [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype (biology)|isotype]], isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).

The term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.

===Type species===
{{Main|Type species}}
[[File:Bufo bufo (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|The [[common toad]], ''Bufo bufo'' described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], is the type species for the genus ''[[Bufo]]'']]
Each genus must have a designated type species (the term "genotype" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for [[genotype|a different concept]] in [[genetics]]). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.

Ideally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Type genus===
{{Main|Type genus}}
A type genus is a genus from which the name of a [[family (biology)|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative but is usually the earliest described, largest or best-known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.

'''Type II sensory fiber''' ('''group Aβ''') is a [[type of sensory fiber]], the second of the two main groups of touch [[Mechanoreceptors|receptors]]. The responses of different type Aβ fibers to these stimuli can be subdivided based on their adaptation properties, traditionally into rapidly adapting (RA) or slowly adapting (SA) neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Olson W, Dong P, Fleming M, Luo W|date=2016-05-01|title=The specification and wiring of mammalian cutaneous low-threshold mechanoreceptors|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=389–404|doi=10.1002/wdev.229|pmc=4864430|pmid=26992078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type II sensory fibers  are slowly-adapting (SA), meaning that even when there is no change in touch, they keep respond to stimuli and fire action potentials. In the body,  Type II sensory fibers belong to pseudounipolar neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Moraes ER, Kushmerick C, Naves LA | title = Morphological and functional diversity of first-order somatosensory neurons | journal = Biophysical Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 847–856 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28889335 | doi = 10.1007/s12551-017-0321-3 | pmc = 5662056 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable example are neurons with [[Merkel cell|Merkel cell-neurite complexes]] on their dendrites (sense static touch) and  [[Bulbous corpuscle|Ruffini endings]] (sense stretch on the skin and over-extension inside joints). Under pathological conditions they may become hyper-excitable leading to stimuli that would usually elicit sensations of tactile touch causing pain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sun W, Yang F, Wang Y, Fu H, Yang Y, Li CL, Wang XL, Lin Q, Chen J|date=February 2017|title=Contribution of large-sized primary sensory neuronal sensitization to mechanical allodynia by upregulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels via cyclooxygenase 1 cascade|journal=Neuropharmacology|volume=113|issue=Pt A|pages=217–230|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.10.012|pmid=27743933}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are in part induced by [[Prostaglandin E2|PGE2]] which is produced by [[Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I|COX1]], and type II fibers with [[free nerve ending]]s are likely to be the subdivision of fibers that carry out this function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arcourt A, Gorham L, Dhandapani R, Prato V, Taberner FJ, Wende H, Gangadharan V, Birchmeier C, Heppenstall PA, Lechner SG|date=January 2017|title=Touch Receptor-Derived Sensory Information Alleviates Acute Pain Signaling and Fine-Tunes Nociceptive Reflex Coordination|journal=Neuron|volume=93|issue=1|pages=179–193|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2016.11.027|pmid=27989460|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Type II sensory fiber''' ('''group Aα''') is another type of sensory fiber, which participate in the sensation of body position (proprioception).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Niessen MH, Veeger DH, Koppe PA, Konijnenbelt MH, van Dieën J, Janssen TW|date=February 2008|title=Proprioception of the shoulder after stroke|url=http://www.archives-pmr.org/article/S0003-9993(07)01699-1/pdf|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=89|issue=2|pages=333–8|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.08.157|pmid=18226659}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each muscle, we have 10-100 tiny muscle-like pockets called muscle spindles. The type II fibers (aka secondary fibers) connect to [[nuclear chain fiber]]s and static nuclear bag fibers in muscle spindles, but not to dynamic nuclear bag fibers. The typical innervation to muscle spindles consists of one type Ia fiber and 2 type II fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poliak S, Norovich AL, Yamagata M, Sanes JR, Jessell TM | title = Muscle-type Identity of Proprioceptors Specified by Spatially Restricted Signals from Limb Mesenchyme | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 3 | pages = 512–25 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26824659 | pmc = 4733250 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type Ia fiber has "anulospiral" endings around the middle parts of the intrafusal fibers compared to type II fibers that have "flower spray" endings which may be spray shaped or annular, spreading in narrow bands on both sides of the chain or bag fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Mancall | editor-first1 = Elliott L | editor-last2 = Brock | editor-first2 = David G | year = 2011 | title = Gray’s Clinical Neuroanatomy: The Anatomic Basis for Clinical Neuroscience | chapter = Chapter 2 - Overview of the Microstructure of the Nervous System | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | isbn = 978-1-4160-4705-6 | pages = 29–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the Ia fibers signal the degree of change in muscle movement, and the type II fibers signal the length of the muscle (which is later used for forming the perception of the body in space).

==History==
The School of Biological Sciences first opened in 1965 at the University of California, Irvine and was one of the first schools founded when the University campus opened. The school's founding Dean, Edward A. Steinhaus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb629006wb&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00041&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=|title = University of California: In Memoriam, December 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; had four founding department chairs and started out with 17 [[professor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bio.uci.edu/about/history/|title = Our History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2014, the School was officially renamed after UCI professor and donor [[Francisco J. Ayala]] by then-Chancellor [[Michael V. Drake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.uci.edu/press-releases/uc-irvines-school-of-biological-sciences-renamed-in-honor-of-francisco-j-ayala/|title=UC Irvine's School of Biological Sciences renamed in honor of Francisco J.

      <text bytes="4500" xml:space="preserve">'''Ultramicrotomy''' is a method for cutting specimens into extremely thin slices, called ultra-thin sections, that can be studied and documented at different magnifications in a [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM). It is used mostly for biological specimens, but sections of plastics and soft metals can also be prepared. Sections must be very thin because the 50 to 125&amp;nbsp;kV electrons of the standard electron microscope cannot pass through biological material much thicker than 150&amp;nbsp;nm. For best resolutions, sections should be from 30 to 60 nm. This is roughly the equivalent to splitting a 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm-thick human hair into 2,000 slices along its diameter, or cutting a single red blood cell into 100 slices.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Electron Microscopy]]", chapter 4, by John J. Bozzola and Lonnie Dee Russell&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Ultramicrotomy process==
Ultra-thin sections of specimens are cut using a specialized instrument called an "ultramicrotome". The ultramicrotome is fitted with either a diamond knife, for most biological ultra-thin sectioning, or a glass knife, often used for initial cuts. There are numerous other pieces of equipment involved in the ultramicrotomy process. Before selecting an area of the specimen block to be ultra-thin sectioned, the technician examines semithin or "thick" sections range from 0.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;μm. These thick sections are also known as ''survey sections'' and are viewed under a light microscope to determine whether the right area of the specimen is in a position for thin sectioning. "Ultra-thin" sections from 50 to 100 nm thick are able to be viewed in the TEM. 
[[File:Salvinia cucullata megaspore.tif|thumb|Low magnification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kempf, Eugen Karl | 
title = Low magnifications: A marginal area of electron microscopy. | journal = ZEISS Information | volume = 21 | issue = 83 | pages = 57–60 | year = 1976 | url = http://www.kempfworld.de/PDF/1976_Kempf_Low_Magnifications_Azolla_Galapagos.pdf | issn = 0174-5581}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an ultra-thin section (length = 0.5 mm) of a megaspore of ''[[Salvinia]] cucullata'' (intermediate lens micrograph taken with the ZEISS TEM 9A – "flying carpet" preparation)]]
Tissue sections obtained by ultramicrotomy are compressed by the cutting force of the knife. In addition, interference microscopy of the cut surface of the blocks reveals that the sections are often not flat. With Epon or Vestopal as embedding medium the ridges and valleys usually do not exceed 0.5 μm in height, i.e., 5–10 times the thickness of ordinary sections (1). 

A small sample is taken from the specimen to be investigated. Specimens may be from biological matter, like animal or plant tissue, or from inorganic material such as rock, metal, magnetic tape, plastic, film, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Micro Star Technologies, diamond knives&lt;/ref&gt; The sample block is first trimmed to create a block face 1&amp;nbsp;mm by 1&amp;nbsp;mm in size. "Thick" sections (1&amp;nbsp;μm) are taken to be looked at on an [[optical microscope]]. An area is chosen to be sectioned for TEM and the block face is re-trimmed to a size no larger than 0.7 mm on a side. Block faces usually have a square, trapezoidal, rectangular, or triangular shape. Finally, thin sections are cut with a glass or [[diamond knife]] using an [[ultramicrotome]] and the sections are left floating on water that is held in a boat or trough. The sections are then retrieved from the water surface and mounted on a [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[gold]], or other metal grid. Ideal section thickness for transmission electron microscopy with accelerating voltages between 50kV and 120kV is about 30–100 nm.

==Advances==

[[Image:Cryo Ultramicrotome.jpg|thumb|right|'''Cryo ultramicrotome''']]
In 1952 [[Humberto_Fernández-Morán|Humberto Fernandez Morán]] introduced [[Cryoultramicrotome|'''cryo ultramicrotomy''']], which is a similar technique but done at freezing temperatures between −20 and −150°C. Cryo ultramicrotomy can be used to cut ultra-thin frozen biological specimens. One of the advantages over the more "traditional" ultramicrotomy process is speed, since it should be possible to freeze and section a specimen in 1 to 2 hours.

      <text bytes="3507" xml:space="preserve">'''Ultrasonic hearing''' is a recognised [[auditory system|auditory]] effect which allows humans to perceive sounds of a much higher [[frequency]] than would ordinarily be audible using the [[inner ear]], usually by stimulation of the base of the [[cochlea]] through [[bone conduction]]. Normal human hearing is recognised as having an upper bound of 15–28&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|kHz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashihara|first=Kaoru|date=2007-09-01|title=Hearing thresholds for pure tones above 16kHz|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/122/3/10.1121/1.2761883|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=122|issue=3|pages=EL52–EL57|bibcode=2007ASAJ..122L..52A|doi=10.1121/1.2761883|pmid=17927307|issn=0001-4966|quote=The absolute threshold usually starts to increase sharply when the signal frequency exceeds about 15 kHz. ...

[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] [[sine wave|sinusoids]] as high as 120&amp;nbsp;kHz have been reported as successfully perceived. Two competing theories are proposed to explain this effect. The first asserts that ultrasonic sounds excite the inner hair cells of the cochlea basal turn, which are responsive to high frequency sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Researchers Tsutomu Oohashi et al. have coined the term [[hypersonic effect]] to describe the results of their controversial study supporting audibility of ultrasonics.&lt;ref name="oo2000"&gt;T. Oohashi, E. Nishina, M. Honda, Y. Yonekura, Y. Fuwamoto, N. Kawai, T. Maekawa, S. Nakamura, H. Fukuyama, and H. Shibasaki.

By modulating speech signals onto an ultrasonic carrier, intelligible speech has also been perceived with a high degree of clarity, especially in areas of high [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] noise. Deatherage states that what humans experience as ultrasonic perception may have been a necessary precursor in the [[evolution]] of [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] in [[marine mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''umbilical ring''' is a dense fibrous ring surrounding the [[Navel|umbilicus]] at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Developmental Biology and Embryology|page=216|first1=Frank J. |last1=Dye|date=21 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118076514|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l7pNfWhZBFYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the sixth week of [[embryological development]], the [[midgut]] herniates through the umbilical ring; six weeks later it returns to the abdominal cavity and rotates around the [[superior mesenteric artery]].

Dense embryonic [[connective tissue]] encircles the attachment of the [[umbilical cord]]. It forms an umbilical ring of [[mesoderm]]al condensation surrounding the [[coelom|coelomic portal]], and is present in the 16&amp;nbsp;mm. embryo, but more emphatically so in the 23&amp;nbsp;mm. embryo. The [[compact tissue]] first appears in the stalk mesoderm, situated superficial to the [[allantois|allantoic vessels]]. Cranially it lies ventral to the umbilical vein and on each side extends into the tissue of the lateral pillars of the cord bounding the coelom. When the myotomic downgrowths reach the ventral aspect, their anterior portions (i.e. the sheaths of the recti muscles) become continuous with the tissue of the umbilical ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The formation of the umbilical cord and the umbilical region of the anterior abdominal wall|last1=Wyburn |first1=GM|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Paper_-_The_formation_of_the_umbilical_cord_and_the_umbilical_region_of_the_anterior_abdominal_wall|date=1939|journal=Journal of Anatomy|volume=73|issue=2|pages=289–310|pmid=17104757 |pmc=1252509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Umbilical hernia ==
When the umbilical ring has failed to close during the gestation (pregnancy) which results in a central defect in the lineal alba. Umbilical hernias are smaller than one centimeter in size that it is present at birth but will only close in four to five years of life. In some cases, hernias don't need any surgical repair but when it is larger in size that protrusion is blighting to the parent and the child, it would require to get an early surgical repair. It is more common in women with increased intra-abdominal pressure during pregnancy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statpearls.com/kb/viewarticle/30753/|title=Umbilical Hernia Article - StatPearls|website=www.statpearls.com|access-date=2019-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
