'''Genetics''' is the study of [[gene]]s, [[heredity]], and the [[genetic variation|variation]] of [[organism]]s, as well as the [[medicine|medical practice]] of diagnosing, treating, and counseling patients with [[genetic disorder]]s.  Humans began applying knowledge of genetics in prehistory with the [[domestication]] and [[selective breeding|breeding]] of plants and animals. In modern research, genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene, e.g. analysis of [[genetic interactions]]. Within [[organism]]s, genetic information generally is carried in [[chromosome]]s, where it is represented in the [[DNA sequence|chemical structure]] of particular [[DNA]] [[molecule]]s.

'''Medicine''' is a branch of [[health science]] concerned with maintaining [[human]] [[health]] and restoring it by treating [[disease]] and [[injury]]; it is both an area of knowledge, a [[science]] of [[Organ system|body systems]] and diseases and their treatment, and the ''applied practice'' of that knowledge. {{selfref|Also see Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Medical disclaimer|medical disclaimer]].}}

'''NOTE''': Most of the articles pertaining to the actual work and practice of medicine are located in '''[[:Category:Clinical medicine]]''' and its subcategories, such as {{cat|Medical diagnosis‎}} and {{cat|Medical treatments‎}}, along with [[:Category:Diseases and disorders]]. Articles pertaining to non-conventional approaches are located in {{cat|Alternative medicine}}.

'''Molecular biology''' is the study of [[biology]] at a [[molecular]] level. The field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated.

'''Neuroscience''' is a field of study which deals with the [[anatomy|structure]], &lt;!-- Function == Physiology --&gt; [[developmental biology|development]], [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], [[physiology]], [[pharmacology]] and [[pathology]] of the [[nervous system]].
Neurology, which literally means ''neuroscience'', is a branch of medicine primarily interested in, but by no means restricted to studying pathology. [[:Category:Neurobiology|Neurobiology]] is another synonym that exists in few languages, but is generally identical when it is not meant as a subcategory.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2018}}
A '''cell culture assay''' is any method used to assess the [[cytotoxicity]] of a material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A cell culture assay for the detection of cardiotoxicity|journal=Journal of Pharmacological Methods|volume=25|issue=2|pages=133–45|pmid=1712416|year=1991|last1=Löw-Friedrich|first1=I|last2=von Bredow|first2=F|last3=Schoeppe|first3=W|doi=10.1016/0160-5402(91)90004-o}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the ''[[in vitro]]'' assessment of a material to determine whether it releases toxic chemicals in the cell. It also determines if the quantity is sufficient to kill cells, either directly or indirectly, through the inhibition of cell metabolic pathways.  Cell culture evaluations are the precursor to whole animal studies and are a way to determine if significant cytotoxicity exists for the given material.  Cell culture assays are standardized by [[ASTM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and BSI ([[British Standards Institution]].)

'''Cell culture''' or '''Tissue culture''' is the process by which [[cell (biology)|cells]] are grown under controlled conditions, generally outside their natural environment. The term "tissue culture" was coined by American pathologist [[Montrose Thomas Burrows]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrel A, Burrows MT | title = Cultivation of Tissues in Vitro and ITS Technique | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–396 | date = March 1911 | pmid = 19867420 | pmc = 2125263 | doi = 10.1084/jem.13.3.387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is also called [[micropropagation]]. After the cells of interest have been [[Cell isolation|isolated from living tissue]], they can subsequently be maintained under carefully controlled conditions the need to be kept at body temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C) in an incubator.&lt;ref name = "Taylor_2014"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Taylor MW | chapter = A History of Cell Culture |date=2014 | title = Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions |pages=41–52 |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_3 |isbn=978-3-319-07757-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions vary for each cell type, but generally consist of a suitable vessel with a substrate or rich [[growth medium|medium]] that supplies the essential nutrients ([[amino acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s), [[growth factor]]s, [[hormone]]s, and gases ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and regulates the physio-chemical environment ([[Buffer solution|pH buffer]], [[osmotic pressure]], [[temperature]]). Most cells require a surface or an artificial substrate to form an adherent culture as a monolayer (one single-cell thick), whereas others can be grown free floating in a medium as a [[suspension culture]].&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris AR, Peter L, Bellis J, Baum B, Kabla AJ, Charras GT | title = Characterizing the mechanics of cultured cell monolayers | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 41 | pages = 16449–16454 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22991459 | pmc = 3478631 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1213301109 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10916449H }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is typically facilitated via use of a liquid, semi-solid, or solid [[growth medium]], such as [[broth]] or [[agar]]. Tissue culture commonly refers to the culture of animal cells and tissues, with the more specific term [[plant tissue culture]] being used for plants. The lifespan of most cells is genetically determined, but some cell culturing cells have been “transformed” into immortal cells which will reproduce indefinitely if the optimal conditions are provided.

In practice, the term "cell culture" now refers to the culturing of cells derived from multicellular [[eukaryote]]s, especially [[animal]] cells, in contrast with other types of culture that also grow cells, such as [[plant tissue culture]], [[fungus|fungal]] culture, and [[microbiological culture]] (of [[microbe]]s). The historical development and methods of cell culture are closely interrelated to those of [[tissue culture]] and [[organ culture]]. [[Viral culture]] is also related, with cells as hosts for the viruses.

The [[laboratory]] technique of maintaining live [[Immortalised cell line|cell lines]] (a population of cells descended from a single cell and containing the same genetic makeup) separated from their original tissue source became more robust in the middle 20th century.&lt;ref name="NIHtimeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?db=Books&amp;rid=mboc4.table.1516|title=Some landmarks in the development of tissue and cell culture|access-date=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioteach.ubc.ca/Bioengineering/CellCulture/index.htm|title=Cell Culture|access-date=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
The 19th-century English physiologist [[Sydney Ringer]] developed [[Lactated Ringer's solution|salt solutions]] containing the chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium suitable for maintaining the beating of an isolated [[heart (biology)|animal heart]] outside the body.&lt;ref name="whonamedit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2119.html|title=Whonamedit - Ringer's solution|publisher=whonamedit.com|access-date=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885 [[Wilhelm Roux]] removed a section of the [[medullary plate]] of an [[embryo]]nic [[chicken]] and maintained it in a warm [[saline solution]] for several days, establishing the basic principle of tissue culture. In 1907 the zoologist [[Ross Granville Harrison]] demonstrated the growth of frog embryonic cells that would give rise to nerve cells in a medium of clotted [[lymph]]. In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew [[vaccinia]] [[virus]] in fragments of guinea pig [[cornea]]l tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Steinhardt E, Israeli C, Lambert RA |date=1913 |title=Studies on the Cultivation of the Virus of Vaccinia  |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=294–300 |doi=10.1093/infdis/13.2.294 |issn=0022-1899 |jstor=30073371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the first use of regenerative tissue was used to replace a small length of urethra, which led to the understanding that the technique of obtaining samples of tissue, growing it outside the body without a scaffold, and reapplying it, can be used for only small distances of less than 1&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Atala A |title=Growing new organs |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_growing_new_organs |work=TEDMED |year=2009 |language=en |access-date=2021-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zurlow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caat.jhsph.edu/pubs/animal_alts/appendix_c.htm|title=Animals and alternatives in testing|access-date=2006-04-19|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060225204205/http://caat.jhsph.edu/pubs/animal_alts/appendix_c.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 2006-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fentem JH | title = Working together to respond to the challenges of EU policy to replace animal testing | journal = Alternatives to Laboratory Animals | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–18 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16522146 | doi = 10.1177/026119290603400116 | s2cid = 10339716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ross Granville Harrison]], working at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] and then at [[Yale University]], published results of his experiments from 1907 to 1910, establishing the methodology of [[tissue culture]].&lt;ref name="Schiff"&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Schiff JA | title = An unsung hero of medical research | url = http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_02/old_yale.html | access-date = 2006-04-19 | work = [[Yale Alumni Magazine]] | date = February 2002 | archive-date = 2012-11-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114035855/http://yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_02/old_yale.html | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlieb Haberlandt]] first pointed out the possibilities of the culture of isolated tissues, [[plant tissue culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonner J | title = Plant Tissue Cultures from a Hormone Point of View | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 426–430 | date = June 1936 | pmid = 16588100 | pmc = 1076796 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.22.6.426 | doi-access = free | jstor = 86579 | bibcode = 1936PNAS...22..426B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the potentialities of individual cells via tissue culture as well as that the reciprocal influences of tissues on one another could be determined by this method. Since Haberlandt's original assertions, methods for tissue and cell culture have been realized, leading to significant discoveries in biology and medicine. His original idea, presented in 1902, was called totipotentiality: “Theoretically all plant cells are able to give rise to a complete plant.”&lt;ref&gt;Haberlandt, G. (1902) Kulturversuche mit isolierten Pflanzenzellen. Sitzungsber. Akad. Wiss. Wien. Math.-Naturwiss. Kl., Abt. J. 111, 69–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noé AC | title = Gottlieb Haberlandt | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 850–855 | date = October 1934 | pmid = 16652925 | pmc = 439112 | doi = 10.1104/pp.9.4.850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/plant+sciences/book/978-3-211-83839-6 Plant Tissue Culture]. 100 years since Gottlieb Haberlandt. Laimer, Margit; Rücker, Waltraud (Eds.) 2003. Springer {{ISBN|978-3-211-83839-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell culture techniques were advanced significantly in the 1940s and 1950s to support research in [[virology]]. Growing viruses in cell cultures allowed preparation of purified viruses for the manufacture of [[vaccine]]s. The injectable [[Salk polio vaccine|polio vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk]] was one of the first products mass-produced using cell culture techniques. This vaccine was made possible by the cell culture research of [[John Franklin Enders]], [[Thomas Huckle Weller]], and [[Frederick Chapman Robbins]], who were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for their discovery of a method of growing the virus in monkey [[kidney]] cell cultures. Cell culture has contributed to the development of vaccines for many diseases.&lt;ref name = "Taylor_2014" /&gt;

== Modern usage ==
[[File:Cho_cells_adherend2.jpg|right|thumb|Cultured cells growing in [[growth medium]]]]
In modern usage, "tissue culture" generally refers to the growth of cells from a tissue from a [[multicellular]] organism ''in vitro''. These cells may be cells isolated from a donor organism ([[Primary cell culture|primary cells]]) or an [[immortalised cell line]]. The cells are bathed in a culture medium, which contains essential nutrients and energy sources necessary for the cells' survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Martin BM |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tl3dBwAAQBAJ |title=Tissue Culture Techniques: An Introduction |date=2013-12-01 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4612-0247-9 |pages=29–30 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in its broader sense, "tissue culture" is often used interchangeably with "cell culture". On the other hand, the strict meaning of "tissue culture" refers to the culturing of tissue pieces, i.e. [[explant culture]].

Tissue culture is an important tool for the study of the biology of cells from multicellular organisms. It provides an ''in vitro'' model of the tissue in a well defined environment which can be easily manipulated and analysed. In animal tissue culture, cells may be grown as two-dimensional monolayers (conventional culture) or within fibrous scaffolds or gels to attain more naturalistic three-dimensional tissue-like structures (3D culture). Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polymeric fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as ''in vitro'' cell and tissue substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed of tissues ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name = "Simon_1988"&gt;{{Cite web | vauthors = Simon EM |date=1988 |title=Phase I Final Report: Fibrous Substrates for Cell Culture (R3RR03544A) |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317053872 |access-date=2017-05-22 |website=ResearchGate |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plant tissue culture]] in particular is concerned with the growing of entire plants from small pieces of plant tissue, cultured in medium.&lt;ref&gt;Urry, L. A., Campbell, N. A., Cain, M. L., Reece, J. B., Wasserman, S. (2007). Biology. United Kingdom: Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company. p. 860&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts in mammalian cell culture ==

===Isolation of cells===
{{Main|Cell isolation}}Cells can be [[Cell isolation|isolated]] from tissues for ''[[ex vivo]]'' culture in several ways. Cells can be easily purified from blood; however, only the [[white blood cell|white cells]] are capable of growth in culture. Cells can be isolated from solid tissues by digesting the extracellular matrix using [[enzyme]]s such as [[Matrix metalloproteinase|collagenase]], [[trypsin]], or [[pronase]], before agitating the tissue to release the cells into suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Voigt N, Pearman CM, Dobrev D, Dibb KM | title = Methods for isolating atrial cells from large mammals and humans | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | volume = 86 | pages = 187–198 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26186893 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.07.006 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Louch WE, Sheehan KA, Wolska BM | title = Methods in cardiomyocyte isolation, culture, and gene transfer | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–298 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21723873 | pmc = 3164875 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, pieces of tissue can be placed in [[growth medium|growth media]], and the cells that grow out are available for culture. This method is known as [[explant culture]].

Cells that are cultured directly from a subject are known as primary cells. With the exception of some derived from tumors, most [[primary cell culture]]s have limited lifespan.

An established or [[immortalised cell line|immortalized cell line]] has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely either through random mutation or deliberate modification, such as artificial [[Gene expression|expression]] of the [[telomerase]] [[gene]].
Numerous cell lines are well established as representative of particular [[cell type]]s.

===Maintaining cells in culture===
For the majority of isolated primary cells, they undergo the process of [[senescence]] and stop dividing after a certain number of population doublings while generally retaining their viability (described as the [[Hayflick limit]]).

[[File:DMEM cell culture medium.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of DMEM cell culture medium]]
Aside from temperature and gas mixture, the most commonly varied factor in culture systems is the cell [[growth medium]]. Recipes for growth media can vary in [[pH]], glucose concentration, [[growth factors]], and the presence of other nutrients. The growth factors used to supplement media are often derived from the serum of animal blood, such as [[fetal bovine serum]] (FBS), bovine calf serum, equine serum, and porcine serum. One complication of these blood-derived ingredients is the potential for contamination of the culture with viruses or [[prion]]s, particularly in medical [[biotechnology]] applications. Current practice is to minimize or eliminate the use of these ingredients wherever possible and use human [[platelet lysate]] (hPL).&lt;ref&gt;Hemeda, H., Giebel, B., Wagner, W. (16Feb2014) Evaluation of human platelet lysate versus fetal bovine serum for culture of mesenchymal stromal cells Cytotherapy p170-180 issue 2 doi.10.1016&lt;/ref&gt; This eliminates the worry of cross-species contamination when using FBS with human cells. hPL has emerged as a safe and reliable alternative as a direct replacement for FBS or other animal serum. In addition, [[chemically defined medium|chemically defined media]] can be used to eliminate any serum trace (human or animal), but this cannot always be accomplished with different cell types. Alternative strategies involve sourcing the animal blood from countries with minimum [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]/[[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|TSE]] risk, such as The United States, Australia and New Zealand,&lt;ref name="bovalco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bovalco.com/blog/post/view/9|title=Post - Blog &amp;#124; Boval BioSolutions, LLC|publisher=bovalco.com|access-date=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using purified nutrient concentrates derived from serum in place of whole animal serum for cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selbornebiological.com/products/lipimax.htm|title=LipiMAX purified lipoprotein solution from bovine serum|year=2006|work=Selborne Biological Services|access-date=2010-02-02|archive-date=2012-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719014420/http://www.selbornebiological.com/products/lipimax.htm|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plating density (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a critical role for some cell types. For example, a lower plating density makes [[granulosa cell]]s exhibit estrogen production, while a higher plating density makes them appear as [[progesterone]]-producing [[theca lutein cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Portela VM, Zamberlam G, Price CA | title = Cell plating density alters the ratio of estrogenic to progestagenic enzyme gene expression in cultured granulosa cells | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 2050–2055 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19324349 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells can be grown either in [[Suspension culture|suspension]] or '''adherent cultures'''.&lt;ref name="Jaccard"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaccard N, Macown RJ, Super A, Griffin LD, Veraitch FS, Szita N | title = Automated and online characterization of adherent cell culture growth in a microfabricated bioreactor | journal = Journal of Laboratory Automation | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 437–443 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 24692228 | pmc = 4230958 | doi = 10.1177/2211068214529288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cells naturally live in suspension, without being attached to a surface, such as cells that exist in the bloodstream. There are also cell lines that have been modified to be able to survive in suspension cultures so they can be grown to a higher density than adherent conditions would allow. Adherent cells require a surface, such as tissue culture plastic or [[microcarrier]], which may be coated with extracellular matrix (such as collagen and laminin) components to increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are adherent. Another type of adherent culture is '''organotypic culture''', which involves growing cells in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment as opposed to two-dimensional culture dishes. This 3D culture system is biochemically and physiologically more similar to ''in vivo'' tissue, but is technically challenging to maintain because of many factors (e.g. diffusion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Humpel C | title = Organotypic brain slice cultures: A review | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 305 | pages = 86–98 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26254240 | pmc = 4699268 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.07.086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell line cross-contamination===

To address this problem of cell line cross-contamination, researchers are encouraged to authenticate their cell lines at an early passage to establish the identity of the cell line. Authentication should be repeated before freezing cell line stocks, every two months during active culturing and before any publication of research data generated using the cell lines. Many methods are used to identify cell lines, including [[isoenzyme]] analysis, [[human lymphocyte antigen]] (HLA) typing, chromosomal analysis, karyotyping, morphology and [[STR analysis]].&lt;ref name=dunham/&gt;

One significant cell-line cross contaminant is the immortal [[HeLa]] cell line. Hela contamination was first noted in the early 1960s in non-human culture in the USA. Intraspecies contamination was discovered in nineteen cell lines in the seventies. In 1974, five human cell lines from the Soviet Union were found to be Hela. A follow-up study analysing 50-odd cell lines indicated that half  had Hela markers, but contaminant Hela had hybridised with the original cell lines. Hela cell contamination from [[air droplets]] has been reported. Hela was even unknowingly injected into human subjects by [[Jonas Salk]] in a 1978 vaccine trial.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan P.

===Other technical issues===
As cells generally continue to divide in culture, they generally grow to fill the available area or volume. This can generate several issues:

*Nutrient depletion in the growth media
*Changes in pH of the growth media
*Accumulation of [[apoptosis|apoptotic]]/[[necrosis|necrotic]] (dead) cells
*Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate cell cycle arrest, causing cells to stop dividing, known as [[contact inhibition]].
*Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate [[cellular differentiation]].
*[[Heredity|Genetic]] and [[epigenetic]] alterations, with a [[natural selection]] of the altered cells potentially leading to overgrowth of abnormal, culture-adapted cells with decreased differentiation and increased proliferative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen HT, Geens M, Spits C | title = Genetic and epigenetic instability in human pluripotent stem cells | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–205 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23223511 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms048 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of [[culture medium]] might affect the physiological relevance of findings from cell culture experiments due to the differences in the nutrient composition and concentrations.&lt;ref name="MindYourMedia"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lagziel S, Gottlieb E, Shlomi T | title = Mind your media | journal = Nature Metabolism | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 1369–1372 | date = December 2020 | pmid = 33046912 | doi = 10.1038/s42255-020-00299-y | s2cid = 222319735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic bias in generated datasets was recently shown for [[CRISPR]] and [[RNAi]] [[gene silencing]] screens,&lt;ref name="pmid31039782"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lagziel S, Lee WD, Shlomi T | title = Inferring cancer dependencies on metabolic genes from large-scale genetic screens | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 37 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 31039782 | pmc = 6489231 | doi = 10.1186/s12915-019-0654-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for metabolic profiling of cancer [[cell lines]].&lt;ref name="MindYourMedia" /&gt;  Using a [[growth medium]] that better represents the physiological levels of nutrients can improve the physiological relevance of [[in vitro]] studies and recently such media types, as Plasmax&lt;ref name="pmid30613774"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vande Voorde J, Ackermann T, Pfetzer N, Sumpton D, Mackay G, Kalna G, Nixon C, Blyth K, Gottlieb E, Tardito S | display-authors = 6 | title = Improving the metabolic fidelity of cancer models with a physiological cell culture medium | journal = Science Advances | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = eaau7314 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30613774 | pmc = 6314821 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.aau7314 | bibcode = 2019SciA....5.7314V }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Human Plasma Like Medium (HPLM),&lt;ref name="pmid28388410"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cantor JR, Abu-Remaileh M, Kanarek N, Freinkman E, Gao X, Louissaint A, Lewis CA, Sabatini DM | display-authors = 6 | title = Physiologic Medium Rewires Cellular Metabolism and Reveals Uric Acid as an Endogenous Inhibitor of UMP Synthase | journal = Cell | volume = 169 | issue = 2 | pages = 258–272.e17 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28388410 | pmc = 5421364 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were developed.

===Manipulation of cultured cells===
Among the common manipulations carried out on culture cells are media changes, passaging cells, and transfecting cells.
These are generally performed using tissue culture methods that rely on [[aseptic technique]]. Aseptic technique aims to avoid contamination with bacteria, yeast, or other cell lines. Manipulations are typically carried out in a [[biosafety cabinet]] or [[laminar flow cabinet]] to exclude contaminating micro-organisms. [[Antibiotics]] (e.g. [[penicillin]] and [[streptomycin]]) and antifungals (e.g.[[amphotericin B]] and [[Antibiotic-Antimycotic]] solution) can also be added to the growth media.

As cells undergo metabolic processes, acid is produced and the pH decreases. Often, a [[pH indicator]] is added to the medium to measure nutrient depletion.

====Media changes====
In the case of adherent cultures, the media can be removed directly by aspiration, and then is replaced. Media changes in non-adherent cultures involve centrifuging the culture and resuspending the cells in fresh media.

====Passaging cells====
{{main|Passaging}}
Passaging (also known as subculture or splitting cells) involves transferring a small number of cells into a new vessel. Cells can be cultured for a longer time if they are split regularly, as it avoids the senescence associated with prolonged high cell density. Suspension cultures are easily passaged with a small amount of culture containing a few cells diluted in a larger volume of fresh media. For adherent cultures, cells first need to be detached; this is commonly done with a mixture of [[trypsin]]-[[EDTA]]; however, other enzyme mixes are now available for this purpose. A small number of detached cells can then be used to seed a new culture. Some cell cultures, such as [[RAW cells]] are mechanically scraped from the surface of their vessel with rubber scrapers.

====Transfection and transduction====
{{main|Transfection|Transformation (genetics)}}
Another common method for manipulating cells involves the introduction of foreign DNA by [[transfection]]. This is often performed to cause cells to [[gene expression|express a gene]] of interest. More recently, the transfection of [[RNAi]] constructs have been realized as a convenient mechanism for suppressing the expression of a particular gene/protein. DNA can also be inserted into cells using viruses, in methods referred to as [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], [[infection]] or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Viruses, as parasitic agents, are well suited to introducing DNA into cells, as this is a part of their normal course of reproduction.

===Established human cell lines===
[[File:HeLa cells stained with Hoechst 33258.jpg|thumb|right|Cultured [[HeLa]] cells have been stained with [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] turning their [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] blue, and are one of the earliest human cell lines descended from [[Henrietta Lacks]], who died of cervical cancer from which these cells originated.]]
Cell lines that originate with humans have been somewhat controversial in [[bioethics]], as they may outlive their parent organism and later be used in the discovery of lucrative medical treatments. In the pioneering decision in this area, the [[Supreme Court of California]] held in ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]'' that human patients have no property rights in cell lines derived from organs removed with their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/51C3d120.htm |title=Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 C3d 120 |publisher=Online.ceb.com |access-date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Hybridoma}}
It is possible to fuse normal cells with an [[immortalised cell line]]. This method is used to produce [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]]. In brief, lymphocytes isolated from the [[spleen]] (or possibly blood) of an [[immunization|immunised]] animal are combined with an immortal myeloma cell line (B cell lineage) to produce a [[hybridoma]] which has the antibody specificity of the primary lymphocyte and the immortality of the myeloma. [[Selective growth medium]] (HA or HAT) is used to select against unfused myeloma cells; primary lymphoctyes die quickly in culture and only the fused cells survive. These are screened for production of the required antibody, generally in pools to start with and then after single cloning.

===Cell strains===
A cell strain is derived either from a primary culture or a cell line by the selection or cloning of cells having specific properties or characteristics which must be defined. Cell strains are cells that have been adapted to culture but, unlike cell lines, have a finite division potential. Non-immortalized cells stop dividing after 40 to 60 population doublings&lt;ref name=Hayflick&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayflick L | title = A brief history of the mortality and immortality of cultured cells | journal = The Keio Journal of Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–182 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9785764 | doi = 10.2302/kjm.47.174 | series = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after this, they lose their ability to proliferate (a genetically determined event known as senescence).&lt;ref name=Worthington&gt;{{cite web|title=Worthington tissue guide|url=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/tissuedissociation/glossary.html|access-date=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of cell culture==
Mass culture of animal cell lines is fundamental to the manufacture of viral [[vaccines]] and other products of biotechnology. Culture of human [[stem cell]]s is used to expand the number of cells and differentiate the cells into various somatic cell types for transplantation.&lt;ref name="pmid14643607"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qian L, Saltzman WM | title = Improving the expansion and neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through culture surface modification | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 25 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 1331–1337 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14643607 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stem cell culture is also used to harvest the molecules and exosomes that the stem cells release for the purposes of therapeutic development.&lt;ref name="pmid27190588"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maguire G | title = Therapeutics from Adult Stem Cells and the Hype Curve | journal = ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–443 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27190588 | pmc = 4867479 | doi = 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.6b00125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological products produced by [[recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) technology in animal cell cultures include [[enzymes]], synthetic [[hormones]], immunobiologicals ([[monoclonal antibodies]], [[interleukins]], [[lymphokines]]), and [[anticancer agents]]. Although many simpler proteins can be produced using rDNA in bacterial cultures, more complex proteins that are [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] (carbohydrate-modified) currently must be made in animal cells. An important example of such a complex protein is the hormone [[erythropoietin]]. The cost of growing mammalian cell cultures is high, so research is underway to produce such complex proteins in insect cells or in higher plants, use of single embryonic cell and [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] embryos as a source for direct gene transfer via particle bombardment, transit [[gene expression]] and [[confocal microscopy]] observation is one of its applications. It also offers to confirm single cell origin of somatic embryos and the asymmetry of the first cell division, which starts the process.

Cell culture is also a key technique for [[cellular agriculture]], which aims to provide both new products and new ways of producing existing agricultural products like milk, [[Cultured meat|(cultured) meat]], fragrances, and rhino horn from cells and microorganisms. It is therefore considered one means of achieving [[animal-free agriculture]]. It is also a central tool for teaching cell biology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieto D, Aparicio G, Sotelo-Silveira JR | title = Cell migration analysis: A low-cost laboratory experiment for cell and developmental biology courses using keratocytes from fish scales | journal = Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 475–482 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28627731 | doi = 10.1002/bmb.21071 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell culture in two dimensions===
Research in [[tissue engineering]], [[stem cells]] and [[molecular biology]] primarily involves cultures of cells on flat plastic dishes. This technique is known as two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, and was first developed by [[Wilhelm Roux]] who, in 1885, removed a portion of the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in warm saline for several days on a flat glass plate. From the advance of [[polymer]] technology arose today's standard plastic dish for 2D cell culture, commonly known as the [[Petri dish]]. [[Julius Richard Petri]], a German [[bacteriologist]], is generally credited with this invention while working as an assistant to [[Robert Koch]]. Various researchers today also utilize culturing [[laboratory flasks]], conicals, and even disposable bags like those used in [[single-use bioreactor]]s.

Aside from Petri dishes, scientists have long been growing cells within biologically derived matrices such as collagen or fibrin, and more recently, on synthetic hydrogels such as polyacrylamide or PEG. They do this in order to elicit phenotypes that are not expressed on conventionally rigid substrates. There is growing interest in controlling [[matrix stiffness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Discher DE, Janmey P, Wang YL | title = Tissue cells feel and respond to the stiffness of their substrate | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5751 | pages = 1139–1143 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16293750 | doi = 10.1126/science.1116995 | s2cid = 9036803 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.690 | bibcode = 2005Sci...310.1139D }}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that has led to discoveries in fields such as:

'''3D cell culture in scaffolds'''

Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as ''in vitro'' cell substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types including Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF), transformed Human Carcinoma (HEp-2), and Mink Lung Epithelium (MLE) would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that, as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more histotypic rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name = "Simon_1988" /&gt;

==== 3D cell culture in hydrogels ====
As the natural [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) is important in the survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cells, different hydrogel culture matrices mimicking natural ECM structure are seen as potential approaches to in vivo –like cell culturing.&lt;ref name="pmid19472329"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tibbitt MW, Anseth KS | title = Hydrogels as extracellular matrix mimics for 3D cell culture | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 103 | issue = 4 | pages = 655–663 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19472329 | pmc = 2997742 | doi = 10.1002/bit.22361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogels are composed of interconnected pores with high water retention, which enables efficient transport of substances such as nutrients and gases. Several different types of hydrogels from natural and synthetic materials are available for 3D cell culture, including animal ECM extract hydrogels, protein hydrogels, peptide hydrogels, polymer hydrogels, and [[3D cell culture in wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel|wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel]].

==== 3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation ====
The [[3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation|3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation]] method (MLM) is the application of growing 3D tissue by inducing cells treated with magnetic nanoparticle assemblies in spatially varying magnetic fields using neodymium magnetic drivers and promoting cell to cell interactions by levitating the cells up to the air/liquid interface of a standard petri dish. The magnetic nanoparticle assemblies consist of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and the polymer polylysine. [[3D cell culture|3D cell culturing]] is scalable, with the capability for culturing 500 cells to millions of cells or from single dish to high-throughput low volume systems.

===Tissue culture and engineering===
Cell culture is a fundamental component of [[tissue culture]] and [[tissue engineering]], as it establishes the basics of growing and maintaining cells ''in vitro''.
The major application of human cell culture is in stem cell industry, where [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s can be cultured and cryopreserved for future use. Tissue engineering potentially offers dramatic improvements in low cost medical care for hundreds of thousands of patients annually.

===Vaccines===
[[Vaccine]]s for [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], and [[chickenpox]] are currently made in cell cultures. Due to the [[H5N1]] [[pandemic]] threat, research into using cell culture for [[influenza vaccine]]s is being funded by the [[United States]] government. Novel ideas in the field include [[recombinant DNA]]-based vaccines, such as one made using human [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] (a common cold virus) as a vector,&lt;ref name=quickie&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/news/wireservice/0,70102-0.html?tw=wn_index_7 |publisher=Wired.com|title=Quickie Bird Flu Vaccine Created|date=2006-01-26|agency=Reuters|magazine=Wired|access-date=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao W, Soloff AC, Lu X, Montecalvo A, Nguyen DC, Matsuoka Y, Robbins PD, Swayne DE, Donis RO, Katz JM, Barratt-Boyes SM, Gambotto A | display-authors = 6 | title = Protection of mice and poultry from lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus through adenovirus-based immunization | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 1959–1964 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16439551 | pmc = 1367171 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.80.4.1959-1964.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cell Co-Culture ===
The technique of co-culturing is used to study cell crosstalk between two or more types of cells on a plate or in a 3D matrix. A similar in vitro model to biological tissue can be used to investigate the cultivation of different stem cells and interaction of immune cells. Since most tissues contain more than one type of cell, it is important to evaluate their interaction in a 3D culture environment to gain a better understanding of their interaction and to introduce mimetic tissues. There are two types of co-culturing: direct and indirect. Using the direct method, cells are in contact with each other in the same culture media or matrix, while using the indirect method, different environments are used, allowing the interaction to take place through signaling and soluble factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miki |first=Yasuhiro |last2=Ono |first2=Katsuhiko |last3=Hata |first3=Shuko |last4=Suzuki |first4=Takashi |last5=Kumamoto |first5=Hiroyuki |last6=Sasano |first6=Hironobu |date=September 2012 |title=The advantages of co-culture over mono cell culture in simulating in vivo environment |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.12.004 |journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=131 |issue=3-5 |pages=68–75 |doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.12.004 |issn=0960-0760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Co-Cultured System is useful for studying the model of cancer tumors, the effect of drugs during therapeutic trials, and the differentiation of cells in tissue models during interaction between cells. the coculture system in 3D model can predict the response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy if the microenvironment defines biological tissue for the cells.

A co-culture method is used in tissue engineering to generate tissue formation with multiple cells interacting directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Paschos |first=Nikolaos K. |last2=Brown |first2=Wendy E. |last3=Eswaramoorthy |first3=Rajalakshmanan |last4=Hu |first4=Jerry C. |last5=Athanasiou |first5=Kyriacos A. |date=2014-02-03 |title=Advances in tissue engineering through stem cell-based co-culture |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/term.1870 |journal=Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=488–503 |doi=10.1002/term.1870 |issn=1932-6254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of non-mammalian cells==
Besides the culture of well-established immortalised cell lines, cells from primary explants of a plethora of organisms can be cultured for a limited period of time before senescence occurs (see Hayflick's limit). Cultured primary cells have been extensively used in research, as is the case of fish keratocytes in cell migration studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapanan JL, Cooper KE, Leyva KJ, Hull EE | title = Collective cell migration of primary zebrafish keratocytes | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 326 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–165 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24973510 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.06.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee J, Jacobson K | title = The composition and dynamics of cell-substratum adhesions in locomoting fish keratocytes | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 110 | issue = 22 | pages = 2833–2844 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9427291 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.110.22.2833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant cell culture methods===
{{main|Plant tissue culture}}
{{see also|Tobacco BY-2 cells}}
Plant cell cultures are typically grown as cell suspension cultures in a liquid medium or as [[Callus (cell biology)|callus cultures]] on a solid medium. The culturing of undifferentiated plant cells and calli requires the proper balance of the plant growth hormones [[auxin]] and [[cytokinin]].

===Insect cell culture===
{{main|Insect cell culture}}
Cells derived from [[Drosophila melanogaster]] (most prominently, [[Schneider 2 cells]]) can be used for experiments which may be hard to do on live flies or larvae, such as [[biochemistry|biochemical studies]] or studies using [[siRNA]]. Cell lines derived from the army worm ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', including [[Sf9 (cells)|Sf9]] and [[Sf21]], and from the cabbage looper ''[[Trichoplusia ni]]'', [[High Five cells]], are commonly used for expression of recombinant proteins using [[baculovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drugmand JC, Schneider YJ, Agathos SN | title = Insect cells as factories for biomanufacturing | journal = Biotechnology Advances | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 1140–1157 | date = 2012 | pmid = 21983546 | doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.09.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/896333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacterial and yeast culture methods===
{{main|Microbiological culture}}
For bacteria and yeasts, small quantities of cells are usually grown on a solid support that contains nutrients embedded in it, usually a gel such as agar, while large-scale cultures are grown with the cells suspended in a nutrient broth.

===Viral culture methods===
{{main|Viral culture}}
The culture of viruses requires the culture of cells of mammalian, plant, fungal or bacterial origin as hosts for the growth and replication of the virus. Whole [[wild type]] viruses, [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] viruses or viral products may be generated in cell types other than their natural hosts under the right conditions. Depending on the species of the virus, infection and [[viral replication]] may result in host cell lysis and formation of a [[viral plaque]].

      <text bytes="12782" xml:space="preserve">'''Cell cycle analysis by DNA content measurement''' is a method that most frequently employs [[flow cytometry]] to distinguish cells in different phases of the [[cell cycle]]. Before analysis, the cells are usually [[wiktionary:Permeabilization|permeabilised]] and treated with a [[fluorescent dye]] that stains [[DNA]] quantitatively, such as [[propidium iodide]] (PI) or [[DAPI | 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole]] (DAPI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the [[S phase]], the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the [[G0 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] and [[G1 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] (before S), in the S phase, and in the [[G2 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] and [[M phase]] (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; versus S versus G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.

Cell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such [[DNA damage]] that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain [[cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]. Such an arrest of the cell cycle progression can lead either to an effective DNA repair, which may prevent transformation of normal into a cancer cell ([[carcinogenesis]]), or to cell death, often by the mode of [[apoptosis]]. An arrest of cells in G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after [[blood serum|serum]] deprivation.
Cell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] by a group from the [[University of California]] using the [[Feulgen stain]]ing technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Multiparameter analysis of the cell cycle''' includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features. The concurrent measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content, or DNA susceptibility to denaturation at low pH using the metachromatic dye [[acridine orange]], reveals the G&lt;sub&gt;1Q&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;, and G&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; cell cycle compartments and also makes it possible to discriminate between S, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and mitotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Darzynkiewicz Z, Traganos F, Melamed MR | year = 1980 | title = New cell cycle compartments identified by multiparameter flow cytometry | journal = Cytometry | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 98–108 | doi = 10.1002/cyto.990010203 | pmid = 6170495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells in G&lt;sub&gt;1Q&lt;/sub&gt; are quiescent, temporarily withdrawn from the cell cycle (also identifiable as G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), the G&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; are in the growth phase while G&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; are the cells just prior entering S, with their growth (RNA and protein content, size) similar to that of the cells initiating DNA replication. Similar cell cycle compartments are also recognized by multiparameter analysis that includes measurement of expression of [[cyclin D1]], [[cyclin E]], [[cyclin A]] and [[cyclin B1]], each in relation to DNA content &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Darzynkiewicz Z, Gong JP, Juan G, Ardelt B, Traganos F | year = 1996 | title = Cytometry of cyclin proteins | journal = Cytometry | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 1–13 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19960901)25:1&lt;1::AID-CYTO1&gt;3.0.CO;2-N | pmid = 8875049 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent measurement of DNA content and of incorporation of DNA precursor [[5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine]] (BrdU) by flow cytometry is an especially useful assay, that has been widely used in analysis of the cell cycle in vitro and in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gray JW, Dolbeare F, Pallavicini MG, Beisker W, Waldman F | year = 1986 | title = Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry | journal = Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 237–55 | doi = 10.1080/09553008514552531 | pmid = 3510993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the incorporation of [[5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine]] (EdU), the precursor whose detection offers certain advantages over BrdU, has now become the preferred methodology do detect DNA replicating (S-phase) cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buck SB, Bradford J, Gee KR, Agnew BJ, Clarke ST, Salic A | year = 2008 | title = Detection of S-phase cell cycle progression using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation with click chemistry, an alternative to using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine antibodies | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 7| pages = 927–9 | doi = 10.2144/000112812 | pmid = 18533904 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental procedure==

[[File:1D30 DNA DAPI.png|250px|right|thumb|DAPI (magenta) bound to the minor groove of DNA (green and blue). From {{PDB|1D30}}.]] Unless staining is performed using [[Hoechst 33342]], the first step in preparing cells for cell cycle analysis is permeabilisation of the cells' [[plasma membrane]]s. This is usually done by incubating them in a [[buffer solution]] containing a mild [[detergent]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

| volume      = 3
| issue       = 5
| pages       = 323–327

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Triton X-100]] or [[NP-40]], or by [[Fixation (histology)|fixating]] them in [[ethanol]]. Most fluorescent DNA dyes (one of exceptions is [[Hoechst 33342]]) are not plasma membrane permeant, that is, unable to pass through an intact cell membrane. Permeabilisation is therefore crucial for the success of the next step, the staining of the cells.

Prior to (or during the staining step) the cells are often treated with [[RNase A]] to remove [[RNA]]s. This is important because 
certain dyes that stain DNA will also stain RNA, thus creating [[Artifact (error)|artefact]]s that would distort the results. An exception is the metachromatic fluorochrome [[acridine orange]],  which under the specific staining protocol can differentially stain both, RNA (generating red luminescence) and DNA (green fluorescence), or in another protocol, after removal of RNA and partial DNA denaturation, to differentially stain double-stranded DNA (green fluorescence) versus single-stranded DNA (red luminescence)&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;. Aside from propidium iodide and acridine orange, quantifiable dyes that are frequently used include (but are not limited to) DRAQ5, [[7-Aminoactinomycin D]], [[DAPI]] and [[Hoechst 33342]].

===Doublet discrimination===

Since cells and especially fixed cells tend to stick together, cell aggregates have to be excluded from analysis through a process called ''doublet discrimination''. This is important because a doublet of two G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells has the same total content of DNA and thus the same fluorescence intensity as a single G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharpless T, Traganos F, Darzynkiewicz Z, Melamed MR | year = 1975 | title = Flow cytofluorimetry: discrimination between single cells and cell aggregates by direct size measurements | journal = Acta Cytol | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 577–81 | pmid = 1108568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| doi         = 10.1002/cyto.1171
| doi-access= free
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless recognized as such the G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; doublets would contribute to [[false positive]] identification and count of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M cells.

===Nicoletti assay===

The '''Nicoletti assay''', named after its inventor, the Italian physician [[Ildo Nicoletti]], is a modified form of cell cycle analysis. It is used to detect and quantify [[apoptosis]], a form of [[programmed cell death]], by analysing cells with a DNA content less than 2n ("sub-G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells"). Such cells are usually the result of [[apoptotic DNA fragmentation]]: during apoptosis, the DNA is degraded by cellular [[endonuclease]]s. Therefore, [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of apoptotic cells contain less DNA than nuclei of healthy G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells, resulting in a sub-G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; peak in the fluorescence [[histogram]] that can be used to determine the relative amount of apoptotic cells in a sample. This method was developed and first described in 1991 by Nicoletti and co-workers at [[University of Perugia|Perugia University]] School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[biology]], '''cell theory''' is a [[scientific theory]] first formulated in the mid-nineteenth century, that living organisms are made up of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of [[reproduction]].

The three tenets of the cell theory are:
# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

The theory was once universally accepted, but now some biologists consider [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as [[virus]]es living organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Luis P. (August 8, 2008) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/ Are Viruses Alive?] ''Scientific American''&lt;/ref&gt; and thus disagree with the first tenet. As of 2021: "expert opinion remains divided roughly a third each between yes, no and don’t know".&lt;ref name="Farnsworth2021"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farnsworth|first1=Keith D.|title=An organisational systems-biology view of viruses explains why they are not alive |journal=Biosystems|volume=200|year=2021|pages=104324|issn=0303-2647|doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2020.104324|pmid=33307144|s2cid=228169048}}&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no universally accepted definition of [[Life#Definition|life]], discussion will continue.

==History==
With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells, known as [[cell biology]]. When observing a piece of cork under the scope he was able to see pores. This was shocking at the time because it was believed no one else had seen these. To further support his theory, [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] both studied cells of both animal and plants. What they discovered was there were significant differences between the two types of cells. This put forth the idea that cells were not only fundamental to plants, but animals as well.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Society. (2019, May 22).

[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|thumb|Robert Hooke's microscope]]
Robert Hooke's microscope was a recreation of [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s microscope in the 17th century, except his was 300x magnification.&lt;ref name=funsci/&gt; The discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass. They discovered that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D’Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscopes]] ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification. [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscopes]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620. In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.&lt;ref name=Gest/&gt;

An extensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses. This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. He made one with a single lens. He was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress in microscope technology until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"/&gt;

Optical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. The development of the [[electron microscope]] in the 1920s made it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again opening up new possibilities in science.&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"/&gt;

== Discovery of cells ==
[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]'']]

The cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. In this book, he gave 60 'observations' in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope. One observation was from very thin slices of bottle [[Cork cambium|cork]]. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named "cells". This came from the Latin word ''Cella'', meaning ‘a small room’ like monks lived in and also ''Cellulae'', which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function. What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the "cellulae" were alive. His cell observations gave no indication of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s found in most living cells. In ''Micrographia'', Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe "seeds" that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovered that generation was achieved otherwise.&lt;ref name="Gest"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gest|first1=H|year=2004|title=The discovery of microorganisms by Robert Hooke and Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek, fellows of the Royal Society|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume=58|issue=2|pages=187–201|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2004.0055|pmid=15209075|s2cid=8297229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects 270-fold. Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these "[[animalcules]]," which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]]. Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study "pepper water" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.&lt;ref name="Gest" /&gt;

The cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.&lt;ref name="History of Biology"/&gt; This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]]. Besides stating “the cell is the fundamental element of organization”,&lt;ref&gt;Dutrochet, Henri (1824) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA166,M1 "Recherches anatomiques et physiologiques sur la structure intime des animaux et des vegetaux, et sur leur motilite, par M.H. Dutrochet, avec deux planches"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.

In 1804, [[Karl Rudolphi]] and [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|J. H. F. Link]] were awarded the prize for "solving the problem of the nature of cells", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent [[cell walls]] by the [[University of Göttingen|Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft]] (Royal Society of Science), Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnat.uni-rostock.de/geschichte/kalenderblatt/kalenderblatt-dezember-2013/ Kalenderblatt Dezember 2013 – Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät – Universität Rostock]. Mathnat.uni-rostock.de (2013-11-28). Retrieved on 2015-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.

[[File:PSM V22 D156 Matthias Jacob Schleiden.jpg|thumb|[[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] (1804–1881)]]
[[File:Schwann Theodore.jpg|thumb|[[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882)]]
Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=L. W. |year=1921 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp |title=Introduction To Cytology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schleiden, M. J. |year=1839|title= Beiträge zur Phytogenesis|journal=Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin|volume=1838|pages=137–176|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/49861#page/347/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though [[Barthelemy Charles Joseph Dumortier|Barthelemy Dumortier]] had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with [[#Modern interpretation|modern cell theory]]. In 1839, [[Theodor Schwann]] states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwann, T. |year=1839|title=Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen|publisher=Sander|place= Berlin|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/schwann_mikroskopische_1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.&lt;ref name="History of Biology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|access-date=17 March 2014|publisher=Advameg, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
:2. The cell is the most basic unit of life

Schleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by [[Robert Remak]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], and [[Albert Kolliker]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/8964| pmid = 10559875| year = 1999| last1 = Mazzarello| first1 = P.| journal = Nature Cell Biology| volume = 1| issue = 1| url = http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| pages = E13–5| title = A unifying concept: the history of cell theory| s2cid = 7338204| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603062810/http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| archive-date = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states ''Omnis cellula e cellula''.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;  This translated to:

:3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells

However, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silver|year=1987|title=Virchow, the heroic model in medicine: health policy by accolade|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=77|issue=1|pmid=3538915|pmc=1646803|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.1.82|first1=GA|pages=82–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that [[binary fission]], which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.

== Opposing concepts in cell theory: history and background ==

The cell was  first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].
The idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn’t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.

===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===

Two opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.
The [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of [[Charles Darwin]]) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33–59|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle and Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.
Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter and Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions.

[[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties.

In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form—the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water—and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.
By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks and Brooks published a monograph, "The Permeability of Living Cells", which rejects the bulk phase theories.

===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===

With the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, {{ill|Karl Lohmann (chemist)|de|Karl Lohmann (Biochemiker)|lt=Karl Lohmann}} discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.
The tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.
 
The modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.
These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact—there are, however, a few dissenters.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===

In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English), in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.

In 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.

Cells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:

# ''[[Eukaryote]]s'':  Eukaryotes are complex cells, which have over time acquired a mitochondrial symbiont and later developed a nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vellai |first1=T |last2=Vida |first2=G |title=The origin of eukaryotes: the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=7 August 1999 |volume=266 |issue=1428 |pages=1571–1577 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0817 |pmid=10467746 |pmc=1690172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adoptive T-cell therapy.png|thumb|Adoptive T-cell therapy. Cancer specific T-cells can be obtained by fragmentation and isolation of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or by genetically engineering cells from peripheral blood. The cells are activated and grown prior to transfusion into the recipient (tumour bearer).]]

'''Cell therapy''' (also called '''cellular therapy, cell transplantation''', or '''cytotherapy''') is a [[therapy]] in which viable cells are injected, grafted or implanted into a patient in order to effectuate a medicinal effect,&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; for example, by transplanting [[T cell|T-cell]]s capable of fighting [[cancer]] cells via [[cell-mediated immunity]] in the course of [[immunotherapy]], or grafting stem cells to [[Regenerative medicine|regenerate]] diseased tissues.

Cell therapy originated in the nineteenth century when scientists experimented by injecting animal material in an attempt to prevent and treat illness.&lt;ref name=testicles/&gt; Although such attempts produced no positive benefit, further research found in the mid twentieth century that human cells could be used to help prevent the human body rejecting transplanted organs, leading in time to successful bone marrow transplantation as has become common practice in treatment for patients that have compromised bone marrow after disease, infection, radiation or chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=starzl/&gt; In recent decades, however, stem cell and cell transplantation has gained significant interest by researchers as a potential new therapeutic strategy for a wide range of diseases, in particular for degenerative and immunogenic pathologies.

==Background==
[[File:Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]]&amp;nbsp;– tried to stop aging by injecting animal testicle extract.]]
Cell therapy can be defined as therapy in which cellular material is injected or otherwise transplanted into a patient.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; The origins of cell therapy can perhaps be traced to the nineteenth century, when [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817–1894) injected animal testicle extracts in an attempt to stop the effects of aging.&lt;ref name="testicles"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ando.2010.01.003|pmid=20167305|title=La thérapeutique du docteur Brown-Séquard|year=2010|last1=Lefrère|first1=J.-J.|last2=Berche|first2=P.|journal=Annales d'Endocrinologie|volume=71|issue=2|pages=69–75|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/en/article/249670}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 [[Paul Niehans]] (1882–1971)&amp;nbsp;– who has been called the inventor of cell therapy&amp;nbsp;– attempted to cure a patient by injecting material from calf embryos.&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/cell-therapy|title=Cell Therapy|date=1 November 2008|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|access-date=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niehans claimed to have treated many people for cancer using this technique, though his claims have never been validated by research.&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;

In 1953 researchers found that laboratory animals could be helped not to reject organ transplants by pre-inoculating them with cells from donor animals; in 1968, in Minnesota, the first successful human bone marrow transplantation took place.&lt;ref name=starzl&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10833242|year=2000|last1=Starzl|first1=TE|title=History of clinical transplantation|volume=24|issue=7|pages=759–82|doi=10.1007/s002680010124|pmc=3091383|journal=World Journal of Surgery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent work, [[cell encapsulation]] is pursued as a means to shield therapeutic cells from the host immune response. Recent work includes micro-encapsulating cells in a gel core surrounded by a solid, but permeable, shell.&lt;ref name="Zhou etal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zhou X, Haraldsson T, Nania S, Ribet F, Palano G, Heuchel R, Löhr M, van der Wijngaart W |title= Human Cell Encapsulation in Gel Microbeads with Cosynthesized Concentric Nanoporous Solid Shells |journal=Adv.

Bone marrow transplants are the most common and well established cell transplantation therapies. The first recording of a successful bone marrow transplant, dates back to 1956 by dr. [[E. Donnall Thomas|E Donnall Thomas]], who treated a [[leukemia]] patient with their twin-siblings [[bone marrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://home.cancerresearch/1956-the-first-successful-bone-marrow-transplantation/|title=Australian Cancer Research Foundation|newspaper=Home.cancerresearch|date=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, for patients presenting damaged or destroyed bone marrow, for example after [[chemotherapy]] and/or radiation for [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (AML), bone marrow derived cells can be infused into the patients blood stream. Here the injected cells are able to home into the affected bone marrow, integrate, [[Cell growth|proliferate]] and recover or re-establish its biological function ''e.g.'' the [[haematopoiesis]]. Annually an estimated 18,000 patients require potentially life-saving bone marrow transplants in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bloodstemcell.hrsa.gov/about/faqs|title=Health Resources &amp; Services Administration|date=2020-03-21|website=HRSA.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, bone marrow transplantation was the only clinically applicable method of cell transplantation, however, since the 1990s, cell therapy has been investigated for a wide scale of pathologies and disorders. Cell therapy provided a novel approach to effectuate therapeutic efficacy. Previously, medical agents could only be effective by directing and inducing the patients own cells. However, in many diseases and disorders, cell are compromised by ''e.g.'' [[senescence]], [[Ischemia|limited blood supply (ischemia)]], [[inflammation]], or simply a reduction in the number of cells. Cell therapy offers a new strategy that supports the introduction of new and active cells to restore previously compromised or deteriorated tissue- and organ structures. As such, in recent times, cell therapy has been recognized as an important field in the treatment of human disease,&lt;ref name=gage&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9579857|year=1998|last1=Gage|first1=FH|title=Cell therapy|volume=392|issue=6679 Suppl|pages=18–24|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; and investigations are ongoing in [[Hyaline cartilage|articular cartilage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fuggle|first1=N.

== Mechanisms of action ==
Cell therapy is targeted at many clinical indications in multiple organs and by several modes of cell delivery. Accordingly, the specific mechanisms of action involved in the therapies are wide-ranging. However, there are two main principles by which cells facilitate therapeutic action:

# Stem, progenitor, or mature cell engraftment, differentiation, and long-term replacement of damaged tissue. In this paradigm multipotent or unipotent cells differentiate into a specific cell type in the lab or after reaching the site of injury (via local or systemic administration). These cells then integrate into the site of injury, replacing damaged tissue, and thus facilitate improved function of the organ or tissue. An example of this is the use of cells to replace [[Cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes]] after [[myocardial infarction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jackson K. A.|author2=Majka S.

===Autologous===
{{See also|Autotransplantation}}
In [[Autotransplantation|autologous cell therapy]], cells are transplanted that are derived from the patients own tissues. Multiple [[Clinical trial|clinical studies]] are ongoing that obtain stromal cells from [[Bone marrow|bone-marrow]], [[adipose tissue]], or [[peripheral blood]] to be transplanted at sites of injury or stress; which is being actively explored for ''e.g.'' [[cartilage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yamasaki|first1=Shinya|last2=Mera|first2=Hisashi|last3=Itokazu|first3=Maki|last4=Hashimoto|first4=Yusuke|last5=Wakitani|first5=Shigeyuki|date=October 2014|title=Cartilage Repair With Autologous Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation: Review of Preclinical and Clinical Studies|journal=Cartilage|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=196–202|doi=10.1177/1947603514534681|issn=1947-6035|pmc=4335770|pmid=26069698}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[muscle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Linard|first1=Christine|last2=Brachet|first2=Michel|last3=L'homme|first3=Bruno|last4=Strup-Perrot|first4=Carine|last5=Busson|first5=Elodie|last6=Bonneau|first6=Michel|last7=Lataillade|first7=Jean-Jacques|last8=Bey|first8=Eric|last9=Benderitter|first9=Marc|date=2018-11-08|title=Long-term effectiveness of local BM-MSCs for skeletal muscle regeneration: a proof of concept obtained on a pig model of severe radiation burn|journal=Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy|volume=9|issue=1|pages=299|doi=10.1186/s13287-018-1051-6|issn=1757-6512|pmc=6225585|pmid=30409227}}&lt;/ref&gt; repair. It could also involve the isolation of matured cells from diseased tissues, to be later re-implanted at the same or neighboring tissues; a strategy being assessed in [[clinical trial]]s for ''e.g.'' the [[Vertebral column|spine]] in preventing disc [[Hernia|reherniation]] or adjacent disc disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mochida|first1=J|last2=Sakai|first2=D|last3=Nakamura|first3=Y|last4=Watanabe|first4=T|last5=Yamamoto|first5=Y|last6=Kato|first6=S|date=2015-03-20|title=Intervertebral disc repair with activated nucleus pulposus cell transplantation: a three-year, prospective clinical study of its safety|journal=European Cells and Materials|volume=29|pages=202–22|doi=10.22203/eCM.v029a15|pmid=25794529|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Meisel|first1=Hans Joerg|last2=Ganey|first2=Timothy|last3=Hutton|first3=William C.|last4=Libera|first4=Jeanette|last5=Minkus|first5=Yvonne|last6=Alasevic|first6=Olivera|date=August 2006|title=Clinical experience in cell-based therapeutics: intervention and outcome|journal=European Spine Journal|language=en|volume=15|issue=S3|pages=397–405|doi=10.1007/s00586-006-0169-x|issn=0940-6719|pmc=2335385|pmid=16850291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of an autologous strategy is that there is limited concern for [[Immune response|immunogenic responses]] or [[transplant rejection]]. Nevertheless, an autologous strategy is often costly due to patient-by-patient processing, thus preventing the option to create large quality-controlled batches. Moreover, autologous strategies generally do not allow for product quality and effectiveness testing prior to transplantation, as it is highly donor (thus patient) dependent. This is a particular concern as often the patient functioning as donor is diseased, and this can impact cell potency and quality.

===Xenogeneic===
{{See also|Xenotransplantation}}
In xenogeneic cell therapies, the recipient will receive cells from another species. For example, the transplantation of pig derived cells to humans. Currently, xenogeneic cell therapies primarily involve human cell transplantation into experimental animal models for assessment of efficacy and safety,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however future advances could potentially enable xenogeneic strategies to humans as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Robert|last2=Platt|first2=Jeffrey L|date=November 2005|title=Current status of animal-to-human transplantation|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|language=en|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1415–20|doi=10.1517/14712598.5.11.1415|issn=1471-2598|pmc=1475507|pmid=16255645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human embryonic stem cells===
{{Main|Embryonic stem cell}}
Research into human embryonic stem cells is [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]], and [[Stem cell research policy|regulation]] varies from country to country, with some countries banning it outright. Nevertheless, these cells are being investigated as the basis for a number of therapeutic applications, including possible treatments for [[diabetes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17053790|year=2006|last1=d'Amour|first1=KA|last2=Bang|first2=AG|last3=Eliazer|first3=S|last4=Kelly|first4=OG|last5=Agulnick|first5=AD|last6=Smart|first6=NG|last7=Moorman|first7=MA|last8=Kroon|first8=E|last9=Carpenter|first9=MK|last10=Baetge|first10=EE|title=Production of pancreatic hormone-expressing endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells|volume=24|issue=11|pages=1392–401|doi=10.1038/nbt1259|journal=Nature Biotechnology|s2cid=11040949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17627139|year=2007|last1=Parish|first1=CL|last2=Arenas|first2=E|title=Stem-cell-based strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease|volume=4|issue=4|pages=339–47|doi=10.1159/000101892|journal=Neuro-Degenerative Diseases|s2cid=37229348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural stem cell therapy===
{{See also|Neural stem cell}}
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the subject of ongoing research for possible therapeutic applications, for example for treating a number of neurological disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name=Bonnamain&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22514520|year=2012|last1=Bonnamain|first1=V|last2=Neveu|first2=I|last3=Naveilhan|first3=P|title=Neural stem/progenitor cells as a promising candidate for regenerative therapy of the central nervous system|volume=6|pages=17|doi=10.3389/fncel.2012.00017|pmc=3323829|journal=Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesenchymal stem cell therapy===
{{See also|Mesenchymal stem cell}}
MSCs are immunomodulatory, multipotent and fast proliferating and these unique capabilities mean they can be used for a wide range of treatments including immune-modulatory therapy, bone and cartilage regeneration, myocardium regeneration and the treatment of [[Hurler syndrome]], a skeletal and neurological disorder.&lt;ref name="oh"&gt;Oh SKW and Choo ABH (2011) "The Biological Basis | Stem Cells". In: Murray Moo-Young (ed.), ''Comprehensive Biotechnology'', Second Edition, Volume 1, pp. 341–65. Elsevier.{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have demonstrated the use of MSCs for the treatment of [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] (OI). Horwitz et al. transplanted bone marrow (BM) cells from [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA)-identical siblings to patients with OI. Results show that MSCs can develop into normal osteoblasts, leading to fast bone development and reduced fracture frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horwitz EM, Prockop DJ, Gordon PL | year = 1999 | title = Transplantability and therapeutic effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells in children with osteogenesis imperfecta | pmid = 10086387 | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 309–13 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/6529 | s2cid = 38011739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   A more recent clinical trial showed that allogeneic fetal MSCs transplanted in utero in patients with severe OI can engraft and differentiate into bone in a human fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Le Blanc K, Götherström C, Ringdén O | year = 2005 | title = Fetal mesenchymal stem-cell engraftment in bone after in utero transplantation in a patient with severe osteogenesis imperfecta | journal = Transplantation | volume = 79 | issue = 11| pages = 1607–14 | doi=10.1097/01.tp.0000159029.48678.93| pmid = 15940052 | s2cid = 7040451 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides bone and cartilage regeneration, cardiomyocyte regeneration with autologous BM MSCs has also been reported recently. Introduction of BM MSCs following [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) resulted in significant reduction of damaged regions and improvement in heart function.  Clinical trials for treatment of acute MI with Prochymal by Osiris Therapeutics are underway. Also, a clinical trial revealed huge improvements in nerve conduction velocities in Hurler's Syndrome patients infused with BM MSCs from HLA-identical siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koç ON, Day J, Nieder M | year = 2002 | title = Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell infusion for treatment of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) and Hurler syndrome (MPS-IH) | journal = Bone Marrow Transplant | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 215–22 | doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1703650| pmid = 12203137 |display-authors=etal| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation===
{{Main|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation}}
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), derived from bone marrow or blood, are cells with the abilities to self-renew and to differentiate into all types of blood cells, especially those involved in the human immune system. Thus, they can be used to treat blood and immune disorders. Since human bone marrow grafting was first published in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas ED, ((Lochte HL Jr)), Cannon JH | year = 1959 | title = Supralethal whole body irradiation and isologous marrow transplantation in man | journal = Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 38 | issue = 10 Pt 1–2| pages = 1709–16 | doi=10.1172/jci103949|display-authors=etal | pmid=13837954 | pmc=444138}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been significant advancements in HSCs therapy. Following that, syngeneic marrow infusion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Der Berg DJ, Sharma AK, Bruno E, Hoffman R | year = 1998 | title = Role of members of the Wnt gene family in human hematopoiesis | journal = Blood | volume = 92 | issue = 9| pages = 3189–202 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V92.9.3189 | pmid = 9787155 | s2cid = 227264894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allogeneic marrow grafting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson A, Trumpp A | year = 2006 | title = Bone-marrow haematopoietic stem-cell niches | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 93–106 | doi=10.1038/nri1779| pmid = 16491134 | s2cid = 205489817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were performed successfully. HSCs therapy can also render its cure by reconstituting damaged blood-forming cells and restoring the immune system after high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hwang WYK | year = 2004 | title = Haematopoietic graft engineering | journal = Annals, Academy of Medicine, Singapore | volume = 33 | issue = 5| pages = 551–58 | pmid = 15531949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of HSC transplantation: syngeneic, autologous, and allogeneic transplants.&lt;ref name="oh" /&gt;  Syngeneic transplantations occur between identical twins. Autologous transplantations use the HSCs obtained directly from the patient and hence avoid complications of tissue incompatibility; whereas allogeneic transplantations involve the use of donor HSCs, either genetically related or unrelated to the recipient. To lower the risks of transplant, which include graft rejection and [[graft-versus-host disease]] (GVHD), allogeneic HSCT must satisfy compatibility at the HLA loci (i.e. genetic matching to reduce the immunogenicity of the transplant).

In addition to bone marrow-derived HSCs, the use of alternative sources such as umbilical cord blood (UCB) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) has been increasing. In comparison with bone marrow-derived HSC recipients, PBSC recipients who had myeloid malignancies reported a faster engraftment and better overall survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhardwaj G, Murdoch B, Wu D | year = 2001 | title = Sonic hedgehog induces the proliferation of primitive human hematopoietic cells via BMP regulation | doi = 10.1038/84282| journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 172–80 |display-authors=etal|pmid=11175816| s2cid = 27907370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of UCB requires less stringent HLA loci matching, although the time of engraftment is longer and graft failure rate is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S, Gurudutta GU, Satija NK | year = 2006 | title = Stem cell c-KIT and HOXB4 genes: Critical roles and mechanisms in self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation | journal = Stem Cells and Development | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 755–78 | doi=10.1089/scd.2006.15.755| pmid = 17253940 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas ED, Storb R | year = 1970 | title = Technique for human marrow grafting | journal = Blood | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 507–15 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V36.4.507.507 | pmid = 4916999 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differentiated or mature cell transplantation===
Alternative to stem- or progenitor cells, investigations are exploring the transplantation of [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated cells]] that only possess low or no proliferation ability. This tends to involve specialized cells able to facilitate specific function in the patients body (for example, transplantation of [[Cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hashimoto|first1=Hisayuki|last2=Olson|first2=Eric N.|last3=Bassel-Duby|first3=Rhonda|date=October 2018|title=Therapeutic approaches for cardiac regeneration and repair|url= |journal=Nature Reviews Cardiology|language=en|volume=15|issue=10|pages=585–600|doi=10.1038/s41569-018-0036-6|issn=1759-5002|pmc=6241533|pmid=29872165}}&lt;/ref&gt; to repair heart function or [[islet cell transplantation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gamble|first1=Anissa|last2=Pepper|first2=Andrew R.|last3=Bruni|first3=Antonio|last4=Shapiro|first4=A. M. James|date=2018-03-04|title=The journey of islet cell transplantation and future development|url= |journal=Islets|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=80–94|doi=10.1080/19382014.2018.1428511|issn=1938-2014|pmc=5895174|pmid=29394145}}&lt;/ref&gt; for establishing insulin homeostasis in [[diabetes]] patients) or support/regenerate the [[extracellular matrix]] production of specific tissues (for example [[intervertebral disc]] repair by transplanting [[chondrocyte]]s&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

==Alternative medicine==
{{See also|List of ineffective cancer treatments}}
In alternative medicine, cell therapy is defined as the injection of non-human cellular animal material in an attempt to treat illness.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; [[Quackwatch]] labels this as "senseless", since "cells from the organs of one species cannot replace the cells from the organs of other species" and because a number of serious adverse effects have been reported.&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/cellular.html
|title=Cellular Therapy
|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D.
|date=21 August 2003
|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]
|access-date=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this alternative, animal-based form of cell therapy, the [[American Cancer Society]] say: "Available scientific evidence does not support claims that cell therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease. It may in fact be lethal ...".&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;

==Manufacturing==
Despite being one of the fast growing areas within Life Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebersmedical.com/enterprise/640-growth-in-sales-of-products-in-cell-therapy-and-tissue-engineering|title=Growth in Sales of Products In Cell Therapy and Tissue Engineering |publisher=ebers Medical | df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the manufacturing of cell therapy products is largely hindered by small scale batches and labour-intensive processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genengnews.com/insights/scaling-up-cell-therapy-manufacturing/|title=Scaling Up Cell Therapy Manufacturing |publisher= Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News | df=dmy-all|date=2018-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of manufacturers are turning to automated methods of production, eliminating human involvement and risk of human error. Automated methods of cell therapy manufacturing have opened up larger scale production of higher quality products at lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knect365.com/next-generation-therapeutics/article/265807c1-940a-49d6-9979-fccebda7532f/cell-therapy-process-development-lior-raviv|title=Cell Therapy Process Development |publisher= Next Generation Therapeutics | df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supply Chain==

Logistics departments of biopharma companies experience new obstacles because of the introduction of new cell and gene therapy products, such as [[Chimeric antigen receptor T cell|CAR T-cell therapies]] and [[Allogeneic stem cell transplant|allogeneic therapies]]. Cell and gene therapies require manufacturer and distributors alike to implement new systems and processes in order to ensure save handling and delivery. Additionally, on-demand inventory therefore becomes more and more important, especially with regard to unforeseeable events like the COVID-19 pandemic, so that supply chain interruptions can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=https://www.susupport.com/supply-chain-optimization-cell-gene-therapies | date=2021-12-20 | title=SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION IN CELL AND GENE THERAPIES | publisher= Single Use Support | df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cellular Agriculture Society''' (or CAS) is a [[lobby organization]].&lt;ref name=ABC2018/&gt; It is an international [[501(c)(3) organization]] based in [[Miami]], created in 2017 to research, fund and advance cellular agriculture.

Cellular Agriculture is the emerging science of producing animal products from cells instead of from live animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2018/10/ivy-league-future-of-food-conference-penn-upenn-vegan-clean-meat|title=Ivy League convenes at Penn to discuss the future of food|author=Hawthorne Ripley|date=16 October 2018|newspaper=The Daily Pennsylvanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellular Agriculture, or Cell-Ag, is actively developing foodstuffs and other animal products that include meat, milk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/leap-forward-for-dairy-reinvention-perfect-day-and-adm-partnership-to-scale-up-animal-free-dairy-protein-production.html|title=Leap forward for dairy reinvention: Perfect Day and ADM partnership to scale up animal-free dairy protein production|website=Food Ingredients First|publisher=CNS Media BV|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eggs, also leather,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.feedstuffs.com/commentary/new-cellular-agriculture-and-rise-neominvores|title=New cellular agriculture and rise of neominvores|last1=Jolley|first1=Chuck|date=14 June 2018|website=feedstuffs.com|publisher=Informa|access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; silk and even rhinoceros horn from animal cells.

A '''cellular microarray''' (or cell microarray) is a [[laboratory]] tool that allows for the [[multiplex (assay)|multiplex]] interrogation of living [[cell (biology)|cells]] on the surface of a solid support.  The support, sometimes called a "chip", is spotted with varying materials, such as [[antibodies]], [[proteins]], or [[lipids]], which can interact with the cells, leading to their capture on specific spots.  Combinations of different materials can be spotted in a given area, allowing not only cellular capture, when a specific interaction exists, but also the triggering of a cellular response, change in [[phenotype]], or detection of a response from the cell, such as a specific [[secretion|secreted]] factor.

There are a large number of types of cellular microarrays:

# [[Reverse transfection]] cell microarrays. David M. Sabatini's laboratory developed reverse-transfection cell microarrays at the [[Whitehead Institute]], publishing their work in 2001.
# [[PMHC Cellular Microarrays]].  This type of microarray were developed by Daniel Chen, Yoav Soen, Dan Kraft, Patrick Brown and Mark Davis at [[Stanford University Medical Center]].

The '''Census of Antarctic Marine Life''' (CAML) is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that researches the marine biodiversity of Antarctica, how it is affected by climate change, and how this change is altering the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scar.org/researchgroups/lifescience/CAML_Annual_Report_09.pdf CAML Annual report 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413193915/http://www.scar.org/researchgroups/lifescience/CAML_Annual_Report_09.pdf |date=2013-04-13 }} published by the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://coml.org/projects/census-antarctic-marine-life-caml |title=Program Description on CoML Website |access-date=2010-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014142853/http://www.coml.org/projects/census-antarctic-marine-life-caml |archive-date=2017-10-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program started in 2005 as a 5-year initiative with the scientific goal being to study the evolution of life in Antarctic waters, to determine how this has influenced the diversity of the present [[biota (ecology)|biota]], and use these observations to predict how it might respond to future change. However, due to modern and extravagant changes within technology, we are able to witness and influence biodiversity reproduction and development. This enables us to gain further insight toward characteristics that allow such biodiversity to flourish within this barren desert referred to as the Arctic and Antarctic.

CAML has collected its data from 18 Antarctic research vessels during the [[International Polar Year]], which is freely accessible at [http://www.scarmarbin.be Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Marine Biodiversity Information Network] (SCAR-MarBIN). The [[ Register of Antarctic Marine Species]] has 9,350 verified [[species]] (16,500 taxa) in 17 phyla, from [[microbes]] to [[whales]]. For 1500 species the [[DNA barcode]] is available.

The information from CAML is a robust baseline against which future change may be measured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scar.org/treaty/atcmxxxiii/ATCM33_ip047_e.pdf Agenda Item] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413190133/http://www.scar.org/treaty/atcmxxxiii/ATCM33_ip047_e.pdf |date=2013-04-13 }} [[Antarctic Treaty]] Consultative Meeting 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Census of Coral Reefs''' (CReefs) is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that surveys the [[biodiversity]] of [[coral reef]] ecosystems internationally.  The project works to study what species live in coral reef ecosystems, to develop standardized protocols for studying coral reef ecosystems, and to increase access to and exchange of information about coral reefs scattered throughout the globe.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pifsc.noaa.gov/cred/creefs.php NOAA Article about the CReefs Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CReefs project uses the implementation of autonomous reef-monitoring structures (ARMS) to study the species that inhabit coral reefs.  These structures are placed on the sea floor in areas where coral reefs exist, where they are left for one year. At the end of the year, the ARMvS is pulled to the surface, along with the species which have inhabited it, for analysis. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/reef-monitoring-structure/ Smithsonian Institution ARMS page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral reefs are thought to be the most organically different of all marine ecosystems.  Major declines in key reef ecosystems suggest a decline in reef population throughout the world due to environmental stresses. The vulnerability of coral reef ecosystems is expected to increase significantly in response to climate change. The reefs are also being threatened by induced coral bleaching, [[ocean acidification]], [[sea level rise]], and changing storm tracks. Reef biodiversity could be in danger of being lost before it is even documented, and researchers will be left with a limited and poor understanding of these complex ecosystems.

In an attempt to enhance global understanding of reef biodiversity, the goals of the CReefs Census of Coral Reef Ecosystems were to conduct a diverse global census of coral reef ecosystems. And increase access to and exchange of coral reef data throughout the world. Because coral reefs are the most diverse and among the most threatened of all marine ecosystems, there is great justification to learn more about them.

The '''Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar)''' is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that studies the species diversity of one of the largest and most inaccessible environments on the planet, the [[abyssal plain]].  CeDAMar uses data to create an estimation of global species diversity and provide a better understanding of the history of deep-sea fauna, including its present diversity and dependence on environmental parameters.  CeDAMar initiatives aim to identify centers of high biodiversity useful for planning both commercial and conservation efforts, and are able to be used in future studies on the [[effects of climate change on the ocean|effects of climate change on the deep sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coml.org/projects/census-diversity-abyssal-marine-life-cedamar |title=CeDAMar on COML |access-date=2010-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926105436/http://www.coml.org/projects/census-diversity-abyssal-marine-life-cedamar |archive-date=2010-09-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Census of Marine Life''' was a 10-year, US $650 million scientific initiative, involving a global network of researchers in more than 80 nations, engaged to assess and explain the [[Biodiversity|diversity]], distribution, and abundance of [[Marine life|life in the oceans]]. The world's first comprehensive Census of Marine Life &amp;mdash; past, present, and future &amp;mdash; was released in 2010 in [[London]].&lt;ref name="Census-2010_Public_News_Release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coml.org/pressreleases/census2010/PDF/Census-2010_Public_News_Release.pdf |title=2010 Census of Marine Life News Release, 23 September 2010 |publisher=coml.org |date= 23 September 2010|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially supported by funding from the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], the project was successful in generating many times that initial investment in additional support and substantially increased the baselines of knowledge in often underexplored ocean realms, as well as engaging over 2,700 different researchers for the first time in a global collaborative community united in a common goal, and has been described as "one of the largest scientific collaborations ever conducted".

==Project history==
According to [[Jesse H. Ausubel|Jesse Ausubel]], Senior Research Associate of the Program for the Human Environment of [[Rockefeller University]] and  science advisor to the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], the idea for a "Census of Marine Life" originated in conversations between himself and Dr. [[J. Frederick Grassle]], an oceanographer and benthic ecology professor at [[Rutgers University]], in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phe.rockefeller.edu/docs/Image%20Census.pdf Entwisle, Amy. 2011. "What Lies Beneath" Interview with Jesse Ausubel, Co-Founder, Census of Marine Life. Imagine Magazine, Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, January 2011; retrieved from phe.rockefeller.edu website (July 25 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Grassle had been urged to talk with Ausubel by former colleagues at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] and was at that time unaware that Ausubel was also a program manager at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, funders of a number of other large scale "public good" science-based projects such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;Grassle, Fred. 2010. Introduction. Pp. ix-xi in McIntyre, Alistair D. (editor). Life in the World's Oceans: Diversity, Distribution, and Abundance. chapter available at http://comlmaps.org/mcintyre/forward/introduction-fred-grassel {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726103547/http://comlmaps.org/mcintyre/forward/introduction-fred-grassel |date=2018-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ausubel was instrumental in persuading the Foundation to fund a series of "feasibility workshops" over the period 1997-1998 into how the project might be conducted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlsecretariat.org/reports-other-documents/feasibility-workshops/ Census of Marine Life: Feasibility workshops. Census of Marine Life website (retrieved 25 July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; one result of these workshops being the broadening of the initial concept from a "Census of the Fishes" into a comprehensive "Census of Marine Life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlsecretariat.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Census-of-the-Fishes_Update-1999.pdf Ausubel, Jesse H. 1999. "The Census of the Fishes: An Update." Draft document available from Census of Marine Life website (retrieved 25 July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Results from these workshops, plus associated invited contributions, formed the basis of a special issue of ''Oceanography'' magazine in 1999;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tos.org/oceanography/issue/volume-12-issue-03 Oceanography Vol. 12, No. 3, Special Issue: Census of Marine Life]&lt;/ref&gt; later that year, a workshop in [[Washington, D.C.]] addressed the formation of an [[Ocean Biogeographic Information System]] (OBIS) which would serve to collate existing knowledge about the distribution of organisms in the ocean and form the information management component of the Census.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/13-3_grassle.pdf Grassle, J.F. 2000. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS): an on-line, worldwide atlas for accessing, modeling and mapping marine biological data in a multidimensional geographic context. ''Oceanography'' 13(3), pp. 5-7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census began in a formal sense with the announcement in May 2000 of eight grants totaling about 4 million US$ to create OBIS, as reported in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] magazine, 2 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA62924795&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=00368075&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w Malakoff, David. 2000. "Grants Kick Off Ambitious Count of All Ocean Life"], [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], vol. 288, no. 5471, p. 1575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COML_Aug2001"&gt;[https://phe.rockefeller.edu/COML_Aug2001/ Ausubel, Jesse H. 2001. "The Census of Marine Life: progress and prospects." ''Fisheries'' Volume 26(7): 33-36.]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, an International Scientific Steering Committee was formed in 1999, which by 2001 envisaged "about half a dozen  pilot [field] programs" for the period 2002-2004 which, along with OBIS and another project called "[[History of Marine Animal Populations]]" (HMAP), would provide the initial activities of the Census, to be followed by an additional series of field programs in 2005-2007, culminating in an analysis and integration phase in 2008-2010.&lt;ref name="COML_Aug2001" /&gt; During the operation of the Census, an additional non-field project was added, the [[Future of Marine Animal Populations]] (FMAP), which concentrated on forecasting the future of life in the oceans using [[scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]] tools.

As a general method of working, project proposals would be debated within the Scientific Steering Committee and, if recommended for funding, a formal submission would be made to the Sloan Foundation for funding to support the Principal Investigators (PIs) and a Project Coordinator, meetings of project participants, and additional Synthesis and Education and Outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sloan Foundation approval was dependent on promises of contributions from additional sources, and projects were encouraged to bring additional resources on board during their operation, the Foundation funds committed were effectively leveraged many times to provide a much more substantial program than would otherwise have been possible. As core infrastructure components, the Foundation also supported the Census' International Scientific Steering Committee and Secretariat, the U.S. National Committee, and an Education and Outreach Network to lift the project's visibility and engage other nations and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sloan.org/programs/completed-programs/census-of-marine-life The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation: Completed programs: Census of Marine Life. Retrieved 26 July 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Census was ultimately estimated to have cost US $650 million, of which the Sloan Foundation contributed US $75 million with the remainder supplied by a large number of participating institutions, countries, and national and international organizations in the form of both direct and in-kind contributions.&lt;ref name="Census-2010_Public_News_Release" /&gt;{{efn|The Census was the largest, but not the only commitment of Sloan funds to "big science" in that decade; from information on its website https://www.sloan.org, the Foundation also provided US $11.5 million to the [[Barcode of Life]] project, an initial grant of $2.5 million to the [[Encyclopedia of Life]], and $18 million to the ethics of Synthetic Biology. Funding to the Census may be eventually surpassed by that to the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (US $60 million to 2017, refer http://www.sciencephilanthropyalliance.org/science-philanthropy-success-story-the-sloan-foundations-25-year-partnership-with-the-sloan-digital-sky-survey/), however that program has existed over a considerably longer period (1992-current).}}

In a retrospective review in 2011, David Penman and co-authors wrote:
{{quote|The Census had its inception in a visionary leader (Grassle) who was able to convince a small group of colleagues of the need for such a project and find a like-minded individual (Ausubel) who saw the opportunity for the Sloan Foundation to take a key role in bring the Census to fruition. This was not leadership that sought out problems to solve – it identified an issue that could not be addressed through conventional national funding mechanisms and could only be approached through a large-scale collaborative endeavour. The Sloan Foundation saw the opportunity to facilitate new science that would also contribute knowledge for wide societal benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., pages 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Census program==
The Census consisted of three major component themes organized around the questions:

#What has lived in the oceans?
#What does live in the oceans?
#What will live in the oceans?

The largest component of the Census involved investigating what currently lives in the world's oceans through 14 field projects. Each sampled the biota in one of six realms of the global oceans using a range of technologies. These projects were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Highlights...'', rear cover listing&lt;/ref&gt;

These field projects were complemented by the three non-field Census projects, namely HMAP, FMAP and OBIS. A series of National and Regional Implementation Committees (NRICs) was also established to progress the involvement of particular countries and regions in Census activities. Towards the end of the project, additional teams were created for education and outreach, and mapping and vizualization products, while a "synthesis" group coordinated the final outcomes (publications, etc.).

==Outcomes==
During its lifespan, the Census involved some 2,700 scientists from more 80 countries who spent 9,000 days at sea participating in more than 540 census-badged expeditions,&lt;ref&gt;''Highlights...'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as uncounted nearshore sampling events. In addition to many thousands of records of previously known species, Census scientists found more than 6,000 marine species potentially new to science and had completed formal descriptions of 1,200 of them up to 2010. Census scientists visited many parts of the global ocean to learn more about species ranging in size from the blue whale to minute zooplankton and microbes (bacteria and viruses); sampled from the world's coldest regions to the warm tropics, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to coastal ecosystems; tracked the movements of fish and interrogated historical records to learn what the ocean used to be like before the influence of humans; and employed forecasting methods to predict what may happen to ocean life in the future. One of the largest scientific collaborations ever conducted, by 2011 the Census had produced over 3,100 scientific papers and many thousands of other information products, with over 30 million species distribution records freely available via OBIS.&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., pages vii, ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as its tangible scientific legacy, the Census was instrumental in building a global community of researchers, many of whom had never collaborated before until they were brought together under the auspices of the Census, and a new approach to collaborative research. As Ian Poiner, outgoing chair of the Census has said, "The Census changed our views on how things could be done. We shared our problems and we shared our solutions."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, page iii.&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2011 review of the Census commissioned by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, David Penman and co-authors wrote: "[Prior to the Census there was] A fragmented research community: Marine biodiversity researchers had few active coordinated national and international research programs and taxonomic research in particular was underfunded and scattered in disparate organizations... [there was] No culture of collaboration and data sharing: Unlike the oceanographic community, marine biology was characterized by small research projects leading to publications but there was little experience or willingness to openly collaborate and share data... [and in addition there was] No recognized open-access data portal for marine biodiversity data: Unlike the "physical science" oceanographic community, there was no recognized data depository or common standards for sharing marine biodiversity data."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarizing remarks, Penman ''et al.'', writing in 2011, stated:

{{quote|The Census, by any statistical measure, was a great success. The large number of scientific papers published and still to be published by Census participants, alone, would be sufficient. Instead the Census has achieved truly global science in biology. It did not profess to provide a complete Census of life in the ocean in 2010 but it did substantially increase the baselines of knowledge in often underexplored ocean realms. From this knowledge base future research and surveys will add more data that can be shared through web-based services such as OBIS. From this we may be able to derive estimates of population diversity, distribution and abundance for selected groups of organisms or regions and a future compilation of such data will show how far our knowledge has moved from 2010... Undoubtedly much research on marine biodiversity would have been carried out over the last decade without the Census. But it would have lacked the global reach and the access to data and technologies that made the Census unique."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, pages 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2011, the Census Steering Committee received the [[International Cosmos Prize]] in recognition of its decade of international ocean research spanning multiple scientific disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.expo-cosmos.or.jp/main/cosmos/jyusyou/2011_e.html |title=Expo '90 Foundation: International Cosmos Prize: The Prizewinner 2011 |access-date=2018-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215185130/http://www.expo-cosmos.or.jp/main/cosmos/jyusyou/2011_e.html |archive-date=2015-02-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
The Census partnered with the [[Encyclopedia of Life]] in creating pages for marine species, and supplied marine material for DNA barcoding in the [[Barcode of Life]] project. [[Google]] and Census of Marine Life partnered on [[Google Earth]] 5.0. Ocean in Google Earth contains a layer devoted to the Census of Marine Life that allows users to follow scientists from the Census on expeditions and see marine life and features found during the Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/02/google-earth-oceans |title=Google Earth adds insight into Earth's oceans &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |access-date=2009-03-23 | location=London | first=Alok | last=Jha | date=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership with the French film company Galatée Films resulted in the production of the film ''[[Oceans (film)|Oceans]]'' which was released in 2009, featuring film of over 200 species at more than 50 global locations.&lt;ref&gt;Snelgrove, pages 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Census of Marine Zooplankton''' is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that has aimed to produce a global assessment of the species diversity, [[biomass]], biogeographic distribution, and genetic diversity of more than 7,000 described species of [[zooplankton]] that drift the ocean currents throughout their lives. CMarZ focuses on the deep sea, under-sampled regions, and [[biodiversity]] hotspots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://coml.org/projects/census-marine-zooplankton-cmarz# |title=Program Description at CoML Website |access-date=2010-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723152415/http://www.coml.org/projects/census-marine-zooplankton-cmarz |archive-date=2012-07-23 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004 until 2011, [[Ann Bucklin]] was the lead scientist for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=September 9, 2019|title=An outstanding role model Ann Bucklin presented with Outstanding Achievement Award|url=https://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/news-archive/news/Pages/An-outstanding-role-model-Ann-Bucklin-presented-with-Outstanding-Achievement-Award.aspx|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-25|website=www.ices.dk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027125302/http://www.ices.dk:80/news-and-events/news-archive/news/Pages/An-outstanding-role-model-Ann-Bucklin-presented-with-Outstanding-Achievement-Award.aspx |archive-date=2019-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Park Squirrel Census''' is a scientific [[wikt:Special:Search/survey|survey]] to try to determine the number of [[squirrel]]s in [[Central Park]].

Based on the 2019 census, there were 2,373 [[Eastern gray squirrel|Eastern Gray squirrels]] in Central Park.

The survey has been covered by various media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy |last=Newman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/nyregion/squirrels-central-park.html |title=Why Count All the Squirrels in Central Park?

[[File:Giant squid Ranheim.jpg|thumb|The [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis dux'', pictured) was for a long time thought to be the largest extant cephalopod. It is now known that the [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'') attains an even greater maximum size. The giant squid seen here measured {{convert|9.24|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length and had a [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] length of {{convert|1.79|m|ft|abbr=on}}.]]
[[Cephalopod]]s vary enormously in size. The smallest are only about {{convert|1|cm|in}} long and weigh less than {{convert|1|g|oz}} at maturity, while the largest—the [[giant squid|giant]] and [[colossal squid]]s—can exceed {{convert|10|m|ft}} in length and weigh close to half a tonne ({{convert|0.5|tonne|lb|disp=output only}}), making them the largest living [[invertebrate]]s. Living species range in mass more than three-billion-fold,{{refn|group=nb|name=massrange|The heaviest scientifically validated cephalopod specimen was a [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'') weighing {{convert|495|kg|lb|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosaetal2017|Rosa ''et al.'', 2017:1871]]&lt;/ref&gt; while hatchlings of ''[[Illex illecebrosus]]''—some of the smallest known—have a mass of around {{convert|0.00015|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[#WoodODor2000|Wood &amp; O'Dor, 2000:93]]&lt;/ref&gt; The mass ratio between the two is &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{495,000}{0.00015} \right ) = 3,300,000,000&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing only adult females, the difference between the colossal squid and the pygmy squid ''[[Idiosepius thailandicus]]''—which weighs {{convert|0.20|g|oz|abbr=on}} at maturity&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[#Nabhitabhata1998|Nabhitabhata, 1998:28]]&lt;/ref&gt;—would be &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{495,000}{0.2} \right ) = 2,475,000&lt;/math&gt;.}} or across nine [[orders of magnitude]], from the lightest hatchlings to the heaviest adults.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ODorHoar2000|O'Dor &amp; Hoar, 2000:8]]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain cephalopod species are also noted for having [[#Anatomical superlatives|individual body parts of exceptional size]]. The giant and colossal squids, for example, have the largest known eyes among living animals.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[#Nilssonetal2012|Nilsson ''et al.'', 2012:683]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalopods were at one time the [[largest organism|largest of all organisms]] on Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smithetal2016|Smith ''et al.'', 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous species of comparable size to the largest present day squids are known from the [[fossil record]], including enormous examples of [[ammonoid]]s, [[belemnoid]]s, [[nautiloid]]s, [[orthoceratoid]]s, [[teuthid]]s, and [[vampyromorphid]]s. In terms of mass, the largest of all known cephalopods were likely the giant shelled ammonoids and [[endocerid]] nautiloids,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[#TeichertKummel1960|Teichert &amp; Kummel, 1960:6]]&lt;/ref&gt; though perhaps still second to the largest living cephalopods when considering [[Tissue (biology)|tissue mass]] alone.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[[#Vermeij2016|Vermeij, 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Giant cephalopods have fascinated humankind since time immemorial. The earliest surviving records are perhaps those of [[Aristotle]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], both of whom described squids of very large size.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gerhardt1966|Gerhardt, 1966:171]]; [[#Muntz1995|Muntz, 1995]]; [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:11]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tales of giant squid have been common among mariners since ancient times, and may have inspired the monstrous [[kraken]] of [[Nordic legend]], said to be as large as an island and capable of engulfing and sinking any ship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SalvadorTomotani2014|Salvador &amp; Tomotani, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar tentacled [[sea monster]]s are known from other parts of the globe, including the [[Akkorokamui]] of [[Japan]] and [[Te Wheke-a-Muturangi]] of [[New Zealand]]. The [[Lusca]] of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Scylla]] in [[Greek mythology]] may also derive from giant squid sightings,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ley1941|Ley, 1941]]&lt;/ref&gt; as might eyewitness accounts of other sea monsters such as [[sea serpent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee1883|Lee, 1883]]; [[#Ellis1994b|Ellis, 1994b]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Size, and particularly maximum size, continues to be one of the most interesting aspects of cephalopod science to both the general public and researchers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[#GlaubrechtSalcedo-Vargas2004|Glaubrecht &amp; Salcedo-Vargas, 2004]]; [[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]; [[#GuerraSegonzac2014|Guerra &amp; Segonzac, 2014]]; [[#Hogenboom2014|Hogenboom, 2014]]; [[#Paxton2016a|Paxton, 2016a]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced by the regular coverage given to the giant squid—and more recently, the colossal squid—in both the popular press and academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a]]; [[#RoperShea2013|Roper &amp; Shea, 2013]]; [[#Rosaetal2017|Rosa ''et al.'', 2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its status as a [[charismatic megafauna]]l species, the giant squid has been proposed as an emblematic animal for [[marine conservation|marine invertebrate conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guerraetal2011|Guerra ''et al.'', 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt; Life-sized models of the giant squid are a common sight in [[natural history museum]]s around the world,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tratz1973|Tratz, 1973]]; [[#Ellis1997a|Ellis, 1997a]], [[#Ellis1997b|b]]&lt;/ref&gt; and preserved specimens are much sought after for display.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LandmanEllis1998|Landman &amp; Ellis, 1998]]; [[#Ablett2012|Ablett, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalopods vastly larger than either giant or colossal squids have been postulated at various times. Perhaps the most notable of these is the so-called [[St. Augustine Monster]], a large carcass weighing several tonnes that washed ashore on the [[United States]] coast near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Florida]], in 1896. Zoologist [[Addison Emery Verrill]] of [[Yale University|Yale]], at the time the country's foremost authority on cephalopods, was initially convinced that it represented a previously unknown species of [[gigantic octopus]], and even proposed for it the [[scientific name]] ''Octopus giganteus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Verrill1897b|Verrill, 1897b]], [[#Verrill1897c|c]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, having received tissue samples he quickly retracted his original opinion, identifying it instead as the remains of a [[whale]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Verrill1897g|Verrill, 1897g]], [[#Verrill1897h|h]], [[#Verrill1897i|i]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the possible existence of such a gargantuan octopus was taken seriously well into the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson1989|Johnson, 1989:9]]; [[#Milne1995|Milne, 1995:171]]&lt;/ref&gt; until reanalyses in 1995 and 2004 of the original tissue samples—together with those of [[globster|other similar carcasses]]—showed conclusively that they were all masses of the [[collagen]]ous matrix of whale [[blubber]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pierceetal1995|Pierce ''et al.'', 1995]]; [[#Pierceetal2004|2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mantle length===

&lt;!--[[File:Squid sucker count.jpg|thumb|255px|Examining the suckers of a giant squid]]
[[File:Steve O'Shea dissecting squid.jpg|thumb|255px|Teuthologist [[Steve O'Shea]] dissecting a giant squid]]--&gt;
Mantle length (ML) is the standard size measure for [[Coleoidea|coleoid]] cephalopods ([[#Shell diameter|shell diameter]] being more common for [[nautilus]]es) and is almost universally reported in the scientific literature. The [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] is the cephalopod's "body", lying posterior to the head and enclosing the [[viscera]]l mass and [[mantle cavity]], the latter being used for locomotion by [[jet propulsion]]. Unless otherwise indicated, mantle length is measured [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsally]] over the midline of the mantle (sometimes specified as ''dorsal mantle length'', DML). It is a straight-line measure, not measured over the curve of the body. In [[Decapodiformes]] (ten-limbed cephalopods), mantle length is measured from the anterior edge of the mantle (near the head), to the posterior end of the mantle or the apex of the united [[cephalopod fin|fins]], whichever is longer. In [[Octopodiformes]] (eight-limbed cephalopods), the anterior edge of the mantle is not clearly delimited dorsally due to advanced head–mantle fusion, and mantle length is therefore taken from the midpoint between the eyes to the posterior end of the mantle. When ''ventral'' mantle length is meant instead of dorsal this is always specified as such and abbreviated VML.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;[[#RoperVoss1983|Roper &amp; Voss, 1983:58]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indication of overall size, mantle length is generally considered more reliable than total length because [[cephalopod limb]]s may easily be stretched beyond their natural length and are often damaged or missing in preserved specimens (this is particularly true of the long [[cephalopod limb|tentacles]] of many squid species).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:106]]; [[#GlaubrechtSalcedo-Vargas2004|Glaubrecht &amp; Salcedo-Vargas, 2004:62]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, mantle length is not equally applicable to all species. Certain [[benthic]] octopuses such as ''[[Callistoctopus ornatus]]'' are able to elongate and retract their mantles and therefore mantle length measurements, even when taken from a live specimen, may vary considerably. Another problematic case is that of the gelatinous [[Cirroteuthidae|cirroteuthids]], whose weakly muscled mantles are prone to substantial shrinkage during preservation. The interocular distance may be a more reliable standard for this group.&lt;ref&gt;[[#RoperVoss1983|Roper &amp; Voss, 1983:55]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total length===
Total length (TL) is measured along the [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] midline with the [[cephalopod limb|limbs]] outstretched and in line with the body axis. It is the greatest measurable extent of a specimen from the posterior end of the mantle or [[cephalopod fin|fins]] (or [[cephalopod tail|tail]], if present&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Arkhipkinetal2015|Arkhipkin ''et al.'', 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;) to the apex of the longest limb.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; It is recommended that arms and tentacles be measured in a relaxed state so as not to exaggerate their length, but historically this practice was not always followed and some of the more extreme published [[giant squid]] measurements have been attributed to artificial lengthening of the tentacles.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;[[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although total length is often mentioned in relation to the largest cephalopod species, it is otherwise seldom used in teuthology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#RoperYoung1972|Roper &amp; Young, 1972:205]]&lt;/ref&gt; As with mantle length, it is a straight-line measure.

Total length is not to be confused with arm span—also known as ''arm spread'', ''radial span'', or ''radial spread''—which may be much larger and is often reported for octopuses (for which the arms usually constitute the vast majority of the length). In squids, total length is inclusive of the feeding tentacles, which in some species may be longer than the mantle, head, and arms combined ([[Chiroteuthidae|chiroteuthids]] such as ''[[Asperoteuthis acanthoderma]]'' being a prime example).

A related measure is standard length (SL), which is the combined length of the mantle, head, and arms, excluding the often long feeding tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clarke1996|Clarke, 1996:1105]]; [[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; This measure is particularly useful for species such as the giant squid, where almost the entire bulk of the animal takes up less than half of its total length.

===Mass===
Mass (often abbreviated WT for 'weight') is reported far less frequently than either mantle or total length, and accurate records do not exist for all of the large cephalopod species. It can also vary widely depending on the state of the specimen at the time of weighing (for example, whether it was measured live or dead, wet or dry, frozen or thawed, pre- or post-fixation, with or without egg mass, and so on).
&lt;!--wet versus dry weight--&gt;
&lt;!--===Other size metrics===

===Methods of size determination===
In contrast to the vast majority of living cephalopods, which are wholly soft-bodied, size determination of the [[#Shell diameter|few surviving shelled species]] (in terms of shell diameter) is comparatively straightforward and can be accomplished with a high level of precision. Whatever the type of cephalopod, in the absence of whole specimens, size can often be estimated from only partial remains. For example, [[cephalopod beak]]s can be used for mantle length, total length and body mass estimation,&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Clarke1962|Clarke, 1962]]; [[#Wolff1981|Wolff, 1981]]; [[#Wolff1984|1984]]; [[#Grogeretal2000|Gröger ''et al.'', 2000]]; [[#Staudingeretal2009|Staudinger ''et al.'', 2009]]; [[#Potieretal2011|Potier ''et al.'', 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt; and this method has notably been used to estimate the maximum size of the [[colossal squid]]. The [[lower rostral length]] (LRL) of the beak is often used for this purpose. The rostral length of the lower and upper beaks is the standard measure of beak size in [[Decapodiformes]]; [[hood length]] is preferred for [[Octopodiformes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clarke1986|Clarke, 1986:11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantle length has been estimated from video recordings of squid in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zeidberg2004|Zeidberg, 2004:4195]]; [[#Phillips2004|Phillips, 2004:ii]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other extreme are [[nautilus]]es, which upon hatching typically have a shell diameter of {{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} or more (depending on the species), the largest hatchling size among extant invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grulke2014|Grulke, 2014:105]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hatchlings of ''[[Nautilus belauensis]]'', one of the larger species, are estimated to weigh on the order of {{convert|5.9|g|oz|abbr=on}}{{refn|group=nb|name=hatchlings|[[#WoodODor2000|Wood &amp; O'Dor (2000:93)]] elaborated on this mass estimate as follows:

==Smallest adult size==
The smallest adult size among living cephalopods is attained by the so-called pygmy squids, ''[[Idiosepius]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reefs.com/2017/10/06/meet-worlds-smallest-weirdest-squid-idiosepius/ |title=Meet The World's Smallest &amp; Weirdest Squid, ''Idiosepius'' |author=Rowlett, Joe |publisher=Reefs.com |access-date=19 January 2019|date=2017-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain diminutive species of the genus ''[[Octopus (genus)|Octopus]]'', both of which weigh less than {{convert|1|g|oz}} at maturity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boletzky2003|Boletzky, 2003:19]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Idiosepius thailandicus]]'' is perhaps the smallest of all, with females averaging {{convert|10.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} in mantle length and males {{convert|5.9|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Average wet weights are around {{convert|0.20|and|0.02|g|oz|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

===Male dwarfism===

[[File:Tremoctopus violaceus5 (rotated).jpg|thumb|250px|Adult male ''[[Tremoctopus violaceus]]'' with large [[hectocotylus]] (arm modified for [[spermatophore]] transfer)]]
The octopod superfamily [[Argonautoidea]] is characterised by markedly dwarfed males.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boletzky1999|Boletzky, 1999:24]]; [[#Boletzky2003|2003:20]]; [[#Normanetal2002|Norman ''et al.'', 2002:733]]&lt;/ref&gt; The four extant genera of the group are ''[[Argonauta]]'', ''[[Haliphron]]'', ''[[Ocythoe]]'', and ''[[Tremoctopus]]'', all of which are exclusively [[pelagic]]. The greatest disparity in the size of the sexes is seen in the blanket octopuses of the genus ''Tremoctopus''. [[#Normanetal2002|Norman ''et al.'' (2002)]] reported a fully mature male ''[[Tremoctopus violaceus]]'' measuring {{convert|2.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length and weighing a mere {{convert|0.25|g|oz|abbr=on}}. By comparison, the large females of this species reach total lengths of {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and probably some {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. This is the most extreme [[sexual size dimorphism]] known among non-microscopic animals,{{refn|group=nb|name=SSD|[[#Normanetal2002|Norman ''et al.'' (2002:733)]] wrote: "The most extreme examples of sexual size dimorphism come from marine or parasitic taxa where females are difficult to locate ([[#Ghiselin1974|Ghiselin 1974]])."}} with mature females being at least 10,000 times heavier than males, and likely up to 40,000 times heavier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Normanetal2002|Norman ''et al.'', 2002:733]]; [[#Fairbairn2007|Fairbairn, 2007:3]]&lt;/ref&gt; The related genera ''Argonauta'' and ''Ocythoe'' have similarly small males, but the females are not nearly as large as those of ''Tremoctopus'', and the size dimorphism is therefore less pronounced. The females of the fourth argonautoid genus, ''Haliphron'', are the largest of all (and possibly the [[#Mass 2|largest octopuses of any kind]]), but the males are also much larger, at up to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Normanetal2002|Norman ''et al.'', 2002:733]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Squid]]s are the largest living cephalopods in terms of each of [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] length, total length, and mass, with the largest species by at least two of these measures being the [[colossal squid]], ''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni''. Reaching an estimated {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in mantle length and {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length, and weighing as much as {{convert|495|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, this species is also the largest of all [[extant taxon|extant]] [[invertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#RosaSeibel2010|Rosa &amp; Seibel, 2010]]; [[#McClainetal2015|McClain ''et al.'', 2015]]; [[#Rosaetal2017|Rosa ''et al.'', 2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; The only other squid that approaches these dimensions is the [[giant squid]] of the genus ''Architeuthis'', with females up to {{convert|275|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|2.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in mantle length, and possibly as much as {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length, making it likely the longest of all cephalopods.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;[[#McClainetal2015|McClain ''et al.'', 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest [[octopus]] species—''[[Enteroctopus dofleini]]'' and ''[[Haliphron atlanticus]]''—can both exceed {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and the former has a maximum total length of more than {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Cirrina|Cirrate (finned) octopods]] can also reach a large size, with the largest captured specimen likely being a ''[[Cirrothauma magna]]'' of {{convert|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} total length and {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} mantle length,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collinsetal2001|Collins ''et al.'', 2001]]; [[#CollinsVillanueva2006|Collins &amp; Villanueva, 2006:294]]&lt;/ref&gt; though observations from submersibles suggest that members of this group can exceed {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voss1988|Voss, 1988]]; [[#Vecchioneetal2008|Vecchione ''et al.'', 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Members of the other cephalopod groups are substantially smaller, although the largest [[cuttlefish]] can exceed {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight and {{convert|50|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in mantle length. Cephalopods of comparable size to the largest present day squid are known from fossil remains, including enormous examples of [[ammonoid]]s, [[belemnoid]]s, [[nautiloid]]s, [[orthoceratoid]]s, [[teuthid]]s, and [[vampyromorphid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#TeichertKummel1960|Teichert &amp; Kummel, 1960]]; [[#Stevens1988|Stevens, 1988]]; [[#Eyden2003b|Eyden, 2003b]]; [[#Larson2010|Larson, 2010]]; [[#Ibaetal2015|Iba ''et al.'', 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;
====Colossal squid (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'')====
[[File:Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni beak.jpg|thumb|left|Beak of a colossal squid, which has the largest beak among living cephalopods]]
Though a substantial number of [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'') [[List of colossal squid specimens and sightings|remains]] have been recorded ([[#Xavieretal1999|Xavier ''et al.'', 1999]] collated 188 geographical positions for whole or partial specimens caught by commercial and scientific fisheries), very few adult or subadult animals have ever been documented, making it difficult to estimate the maximum size of the species. [[#McClainetal2015|McClain ''et al.'' (2015)]] stated that only 12 "complete" specimens were known.
The largest known complete specimen of the colossal squid was a mature female captured in the [[Ross Sea]] in February 2007. Its weight was initially estimated at {{convert|450|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, its mantle length at {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and its total length at {{convert|8|–|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]; [[#howbig|[Anonymous], {{abbr|N.d.|No date}}]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once completely thawed the specimen was found to weigh {{convert|495|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but to measure only {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in mantle length and {{convert|4.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[#howbig|[Anonymous], {{abbr|N.d.|No date}}]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the specimen, and particularly its tentacles, shrank considerably ''post mortem'' as a result of dehydration, having been kept in a freezer for 14 months. (As reported by the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]], specimens of ''[[Nototodarus sloanii]]'', the New Zealand arrow squid, can shrink by as much as 22% when dehydrated with alcohol solutions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;) The colossal squid specimen contracted by a further 5% after several years in preservative fluid (first [[formalin]] and later [[propylene glycol]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lovis2011|Lovis, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt; The fins of the 2007 Ross Sea specimen measured around {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} across&lt;!--see embedded video where width is measured at 1.21 m; measurements given in text ("1,183 millimetres long and 982 millimetres wide") appear to have been reversed--&gt; and it had a mantle width of {{convert|98.2|cm|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#body|[Anonymous], {{abbr|N.d.|No date}}]]&lt;/ref&gt; The arms ranged in length from {{convert|0.85|to|1.15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while the two tentacles were around {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} long&lt;!--TL should be &gt;4.6 m--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#limbs|[Anonymous], {{abbr|N.d.|No date}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:N20090116 120650--pan.jpg|thumb|The 2007 Ross Sea specimen as it appears now, on display at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]]]
Beaks recovered from sperm whale stomachs indicate the existence of animals surpassing even the 2007 Ross Sea specimen. That specimen had a [[lower rostral length]] (LRL) of {{convert|42.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and weighed {{convert|495|kg|lb|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[#beak|[Anonymous], {{abbr|N.d.|No date}}]]&lt;/ref&gt; where as the {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} submature female from 2003 had a LRL of {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OShea2003c|O'Shea, 2003c]]&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the largest known colossal squid beak from a sperm whale stomach measured {{convert|49|mm|in|abbr=on}} in LRL.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; Though the number of large colossal squid specimens known to science is too small to get a good idea of the relationship between beak size and overall body size, a beak of such enormity indicates a truly massive animal weighing perhaps as much as {{convert|600|–|700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, the [[allometry|scaling relationship]] for this species shows considerable latitude, as demonstrated by a beak of {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} LRL extracted from an animal weighing only {{convert|160|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

====Giant squid (''Architeuthis dux'')====
[[File:Logy bay giant squid 1873.png|thumb|left|A giant squid specimen; the extremely long feeding tentacles of the giant squid make it the longest known cephalopod, past or present.]]
The maximum size of the [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis dux'') has long been a subject of both popular debate and academic inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998b|Ellis, 1998b]]; [[#Paxton2016a|Paxton, 2016a]]; [[#Bittel2016|Bittel, 2016]]; [[#Romanovetal2017|Romanov ''et al.'', 2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the colossal squid, the giant squid is known from a substantial number of mature specimens. The [[List of giant squid specimens and sightings|total number of recorded specimens]] (across all developmental stages) approaches a thousand, with approximately 700 documented {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, of which around 460 had been measured in some way.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;[[#Paxton2016a|Paxton, 2016a]]&lt;/ref&gt; This number has since increased substantially, with 57 specimens recorded from Japanese waters during an exceptional 15-month period between 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;[[#Kuboderaetal2016|Kubodera ''et al.'', 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Giant squid melb aquarium03.jpg|thumb|A giant squid measuring {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length and weighing {{convert|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} displayed in a {{convert|3.5|tonne|lb|adj=on}} block of ice at the [[Melbourne Aquarium]]&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Holroyd2005|Holroyd, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Based on a 40-year data set of more than 50 giant squid specimens, [[#RoperShea2013|Roper &amp; Shea (2013:114)]] suggest an average total length at maturity of {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a "rarely encountered maximum length" of {{convert|14|–|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Of the nearly 100 specimens examined by [[Clyde Roper]], the largest was "{{convert|46|ft|m}} long".&lt;ref&gt;[[#CerulloRoper2012|Cerullo &amp; Roper, 2012:22]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad (2008)]] give a maximum total length of {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}} for females based on the examination of more than 130 specimens, measured ''post mortem'' and relaxed, as well as beaks recovered from [[sperm whale]]s (which do not exceed the size of those found in the largest complete specimens). [[Steve O'Shea]] estimated the maximum total length for males at {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;[[#OShea2003a|O'Shea, 2003a]]&lt;/ref&gt; Older records of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more were likely exaggerated by stretching of the long [[cephalopod limb|feeding tentacles]] or resulted from inadequate measurement methods such as pacing.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;[[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]; [[#RoperShea2013|Roper &amp; Shea, 2013:113]]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shea has stated that, given the available evidence, the highest [[upper bound]] he would consider plausible for the giant squid's total length would be {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and that the likelihood that there exist 20-metre giant squid is "so exceedingly remote that you couldn't justify the effort in writing about it".&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;[[#Bittel2016|Bittel, 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Including the head and [[cephalopod limb|arms]] but excluding the [[cephalopod limb|tentacles]] (standard length, SL), the species very rarely exceeds {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} according to [[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad (2008)]]. [[#Paxton2016a|Paxton (2016a)]] considers {{convert|9.45|m|ft|abbr=on}} to be the greatest reliably measured SL, based on a specimen reported by [[#Verrill1880a|Verrill (1880a:192)]], and considers specimens of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} SL or more to be "very probable", but these conclusions have been criticised by giant squid experts.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;[[#Greshko2016|Greshko, 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[#OShea2003a|O'Shea (2003a)]] put the maximum weight of female giant squid at {{convert|275|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, based on the examination of some 105 specimens as well as beaks recovered from [[sperm whale]]s (which do not exceed the size of those found in the largest complete specimens). Giant squid are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually size dimorphic]], with the maximum weight for males estimated at {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; though heavier specimens have occasionally been reported (such as a {{convert|190|kg|lb|abbr=on}} specimen&lt;ref&gt;[[#Deagleetal2005|Deagle ''et al.'', 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a {{convert|163|kg|lb|abbr=on}} specimen&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hofilena2014|Hofilena, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;). [[#RoperJereb2010a|Roper &amp; Jereb (2010a:121)]] give a maximum weight of up to {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and "possibly greater". Discredited weights of as much as a [[tonne]] ({{convert|1|tonne|lb|disp=output only}}) or more are not uncommon in older literature (see [[#Mass estimates|below]]).&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

====Other squid taxa====
[[File:Taningia danae (160 cm ML).jpg|thumb|Dana octopus squid]]
The third-heaviest extant squid species is ''[[Taningia danae]]'', also known as the Dana octopus squid. The largest well documented specimen is a 160&amp;nbsp;cm ML mature female reported by [[#RoperVecchione1993|Roper &amp; Vecchione (1993)]] from the North Atlantic. The original paper gave the mass of this specimen as {{convert|61.4|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but according to [[#RoperJereb2010h|Roper &amp; Jereb (2010h:266)]] this figure is wrong and stems from a typographical error, the correct mass being {{convert|161.4|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. [[#RoperVecchione1993|Roper &amp; Vecchione (1993)]] were however consistent in their use of the 61.4&amp;nbsp;kg figure. Another similarly large specimen—a female weighing {{convert|124|kg|lb|abbr=on}}—was reported from northern Spanish waters by [[#Gonzalezetal2003|González ''et al.'' (2003:297)]] (see also initial reports&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anonymous2000|[Anonymous], 2000]]; [[#Wong2000|Wong, 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;). In July 2010, a [[sperm whale]] was photographed off the [[Azores|Azorean]] island of [[Faial Island|Faial]] with a large squid—likely ''T.&amp;nbsp;danae''—in its mouth. The specimen's maximum width, from fin tip to fin tip, was estimated at {{convert|1.5|–|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}; this would approximate its mantle length.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vecchioneetal2010|Vecchione ''et al.'', 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--looks much smaller if whale is only 6–7 m long--&gt;

[[#Nesis1987|Nesis (1987:192)]] likewise gave a maximum mantle length of {{convert|230|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, but [[#RoperJereb2010i|Roper &amp; Jereb (2010i:364)]] wrote that "this old record might be in error", with the species commonly growing to {{convert|160|cm|ft|abbr=on}} ML. [[#GlaubrechtSalcedo-Vargas2004|Glaubrecht &amp; Salcedo-Vargas (2004:66)]] provided a maximum total length of {{convert|4|–|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Literature sources give a maximum weight of {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roperetal1984|Roper ''et al.'', 1984]]; [[#RoperJereb2010i|Roper &amp; Jereb, 2010i:364]]; [[#Okutani2015b|Okutani, 2015b]]&lt;/ref&gt; There exist numerous published records of large individuals of this species.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Dall1873|Dall, 1873]]; [[#Verrill1876|Verrill, 1876]]; [[#Phillips1933|Phillips, 1933]]; [[#Croker1934|Croker, 1934]]; [[#Phillips1961|Phillips, 1961]]; [[#Smith1963|Smith, 1963]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kondakovia longimana]]'', sometimes known as the giant warty squid, is a little known species with a circum-[[Antarctic]] distribution in the [[Southern Ocean]].

In 2002, a giant specimen of ''[[Haliphron atlanticus]]'', the seven-arm octopus, was caught by fishermen trawling at a depth of {{convert|920|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the eastern [[Chatham Rise]], [[New Zealand]].

Certain extinct cephalopods rivalled or even exceeded the size of the largest living species.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carnall2017|Carnall, 2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the subclass [[Ammonoidea]] is known to have included a considerable number of species that may be considered "giant" (defined by [[#Stevens1988|Stevens, 1988]] as those exceeding {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in shell diameter).

In 1971 a portion of an ammonite possibly surpassing this specimen was reportedly found in a [[brickyard]] in [[Bottrop]], western Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beer2015|Beer, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; A specimen found by Jim Rockwood, from the [[Late Triassic]] near [[Williston Lake]], [[British Columbia]], was said to measure more than {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} across, but was later determined to be a [[concretion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#concretion|[Anonymous], {{abbr|N.d.|No date}}]]; [[#Anonymous2008|[Anonymous], 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heteromorph ammonite]]s are known to have exceeded {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length also, but since their shells were uncoiled to varying degrees, they were overall much smaller than the largest non-heteromorphs. The greatest lengths of all were reached by the [[orthocone]]s of [[Endocerida|endocerid]] [[nautiloid]]s such as ''[[Cameroceras]]'' and ''[[Endoceras]]'', which may have exceeded {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, although their maximum size is uncertain; while the largest well documented endocerid fossil is likely the 3-metre-long ({{convert|3|m|ft|disp=output only}}) shell fragment housed at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], [[Harvard University]], there are published reports of even larger specimens. [[#Teichert1927|Teichert (1927)]] mentioned specimens up to {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long from the [[Middle Ordovician]] [[limestone]] of [[Estonia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#TeichertKummel1960|Teichert &amp; Kummel, 1960:2]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[#Frey1995|Frey (1995:72)]] gave a maximum shell length of {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} for the group. On the subject of endocerid size, nautiloid specialist [[Rousseau H. Flower]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are not all large, by any means, but specimens twelve feet [{{convert|12|ft|m|disp=output only}}] in length have been collected, and fragments of greater diameter indicate a much greater maximum length. I am not wholly inclined to discredit a report of an endoceroid found in a quarry near [[Watertown, New York|Watertown New York]], which was measured before it was broken up and found to attain a length of {{convert|30|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flower1955|Flower, 1955:329]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the uncoiled length of the largest ammonites far exceeds that of even these giant endocerids. ''[[Parapuzosia seppenradensis]]'', the largest known ammonite species, had an estimated maximum unrolled shell length of around {{convert|60|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. It was also possibly the heaviest of all known cephalopods, past or present, with an estimated live mass of {{convert|1456|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, of which the shell would constitute 705&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Landois1898|Landois, 1898:27]]&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the largest endocerids may have weighed around {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In terms of mass, these are the largest known [[invertebrate]]s that have ever lived,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grulke2014|Grulke, 2014:124]]&lt;/ref&gt; though perhaps still second to the largest living cephalopods when considering [[Tissue (biology)|tissue mass]] alone, since in shell-bearing species the vast majority of the living tissue is restricted to the [[body chamber]], which occupies only a fraction of the internal shell volume.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; They might also be the largest—or at least longest—shell-bearing animals that have ever lived.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|name=largestshell|Depending on how one defines 'shell-bearing', other extinct contenders could include the aquatic turtles ''[[Archelon]]'' and ''[[Stupendemys]]'' (the former having a skeletal framework rather than a solid shell), the tortoise ''[[Megalochelys]]'', and the [[Armour (anatomy)|armoured]] mammal ''[[Glyptodon]]'' and its relatives.&lt;!--ankylosaurs?--&gt;}}

===Historical claims===
====Misidentifications====
[[File:Moroteuthis robusta.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kubota's photograph of a large ''[[Onykia robusta]]'', which was misidentified as the [[giant squid]], ''Architeuthis dux''. [[wide-angle lens|Wide-angle photography]] exaggerated the size of the squid&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:211]]&lt;/ref&gt; such that it appeared impossibly large for the species.]]
The maximum sizes of certain cephalopod species, most notably the giant squid and giant Pacific octopus, have often been misreported and exaggerated. The literature on cephalopod size has been further muddied by the frequent misattribution of various squid specimens to the giant squid genus ''Architeuthis'', often based solely on their large size. In the academic literature alone, such misidentifications encompass at least the [[Oegopsina|oegopsid]] families [[Chiroteuthidae]], [[Cranchiidae]], [[Ommastrephidae]], [[Onychoteuthidae]], and [[Psychroteuthidae]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a]]; [[#Salcedo-Vargas1999|Salcedo-Vargas, 1999]]; [[#GlaubrechtSalcedo-Vargas2004|Glaubrecht &amp; Salcedo-Vargas, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|name=Psychroteuthidae|[[#Iwai1956|Iwai (1956:139)]] reported on two small squid (92 and 104&amp;nbsp;mm ML) recovered from the "digestive canal" of a [[sperm whale]], which he identified as belonging to the genus ''[[Architeuthis]]''. [[#RoperYoung1972|Roper &amp; Young (1972:220)]] showed that this was certainly a misidentification and attributed them instead to the family [[Psychroteuthidae]]. In a brief summary of this case, [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis (1998a:121)]] gave an erroneous total length of "8 feet" ({{convert|8|ft|m|disp=output only}}) for the larger of the two specimens (even though in an almost word-for-word identical [[footnote]] in [[#Ellis1994a|Ellis, 1994a:145]] he correctly stated the total length was "8 inches" [{{convert|8|in|cm|disp=output only}}]). This mistake was repeated by [[#GlaubrechtSalcedo-Vargas2004|Glaubrecht &amp; Salcedo-Vargas (2004:67)]], giving rise to the claim of an implausibly large psychroteuthid "with about three meter total length".}} This situation is further confused by the occasional usage of the [[common name]] 'giant squid' in reference to large squids of other genera.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robson1933|Robson, 1933:681]]; see for example [[#MitsukuriIkeda1895|Mitsukuri &amp; Ikeda, 1895]]; [[#MeekGoddard1926|Meek &amp; Goddard, 1926]]; [[#ClarkeRobson1929|Clarke &amp; Robson, 1929]]; [[#Phillips1933|Phillips, 1933]]; [[#Croker1934|Croker, 1934]]; [[#Rees1950|Rees, 1950]]; [[#Smith1963|Smith, 1963]]; [[#Nesis1970|Nesis, 1970]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable misidentification relates to a photograph taken some time before 1993 by diver H. Kubota off southern [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:211]]; [[#Norman2000|Norman, 2000:174]]&lt;/ref&gt; The image shows a large individual of ''[[Onykia robusta]]'' (previously known as ''Moroteuthis robusta''), which appears to be sick or dying, alongside a diver in shallow water.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; A video of the same animal appeared in a Japanese made-for-television film.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; The image was published in the 1993 book ''European Seashells'' by [[Guido T. Poppe]] and Yoshihiro Goto, where it was identified as ''Architeuthis dux'', the giant squid, and said to have been taken in the [[North Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#PoppeGoto1993|Poppe &amp; Goto, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; If true, this image would represent the first known photograph of a live giant squid. In ''[[The Search for the Giant Squid]]'' (1998), [[Richard Ellis (biologist)|Richard Ellis]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a moment, I thought that some obscure photograph had captured the most elusive image in natural history. Fortunately for those who have devoted their lives to searching for ''Architeuthis'', this was only an aberration, a case of mistaken identity.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It would be more than a decade before the true first photographs of a live giant squid in the wild were taken on 30 September 2004 by [[Tsunemi Kubodera]] and [[Kyoichi Mori]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#KuboderaMori2005|Kubodera &amp; Mori, 2005]]; [[#Kubodera2010|Kubodera, 2010:25]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-sighting-of-an-adult-giant-squid-in-its-natural-habitat --&gt; Kubodera and his team subsequently became the first to ''film'' a live ''adult'' giant squid on 4 December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anonymous2007|[Anonymous], 2007]]; [[#Kubodera2010|Kubodera, 2010:38]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the first to ''film'' a live giant squid ''in its natural habitat'' in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anonymous2013|[Anonymous], 2013]]; [[#NHK2013c|[NHK], 2013c]]&lt;/ref&gt; These milestones were preceded by the first footage of a live ([[paralarva]]l) giant squid in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baird2002|Baird, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-capture-of-living-giant-squid --&gt; and the first image of a live adult giant squid on 15 January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anonymous2002a|[Anonymous], 2002a]]; [[#OShea2003d|O'Shea, 2003d]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, live giant squid have been photographed and filmed on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' [[#Guerraetal2018|Guerra ''et al.'', 2018]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giant squid====
[[File:Giant squid catalina.png|thumb|The "nearly perfect specimen" that was beached alive in [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay]], [[Newfoundland]], on 24 September 1877. A number of exceptionally large giant squid were reported from Newfoundland in the 1870s, and these were meticulously documented in a series of papers by zoologist [[Addison Emery Verrill]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coe1929|Coe, 1929:36]]; [[#GEVerrill1958|G.E. Verrill, 1958:69]]; see [[#Verrill1874a|Verrill 1874a]], [[#Verrill1874b|b]]; [[#Verrill1875a|1875a]], [[#Verrill1875b|b]], [[#Verrill1875c|c]]; [[#Verrill1876|1876]]; [[#Verrill1877|1877]]; [[#Verrill1878|1878]]; [[#Verrill1880a|1880a]], [[#Verrill1880b|b]]; [[#Verrill1881a|1881a]], [[#Verrill1881b|b]]; [[#Verrill1882a|1882a]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Reports of giant squid (''Architeuthis dux'') specimens reaching or even exceeding {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total length are widespread, but no animals approaching this size have been scientifically documented in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]; [[#Dery2013|Dery, 2013]]; [[#Yong2015|Yong, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite there being [[List of giant squid specimens and sightings|hundreds of specimens]] available for study ({{circa}} 700 documented as of 2015, of which {{circa}} 460 measured in some way&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;), including numerous recent examples, such as the 57 specimens recorded from Japanese waters over a 15-month period in 2014–2015.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; It is now thought likely that such lengths were achieved by great lengthening of the two long [[cephalopod limb|feeding tentacles]], analogous to stretching elastic bands, or resulted from inadequate measurement methods such as pacing.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

On the subject of the oft-cited maximum size of 18 metres—or 60 feet—[[#Dery2013|Dery (2013)]] quoted giant squid experts [[Steve O'Shea]] and [[Clyde Roper]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If this figure [45 ft or {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] seems a little short of the [[Brobdingnagian]] claims made for ''Architeuthis'' in most [[Popular science|pop-science]] stories about the animal, that's probably because virtually every general-interest article dutifully repeats the magic number of ''60'' feet.

Steve O'Shea deplores the media's perpetuation of what he believes to be a credulity-straining exaggeration, based on the 19th-century biologist [[Thomas William Kirk|Thomas Kirk]]'s eyeball estimate of a specimen's length.{{refn|group=nb|name=longimanus}} In a comment on the final draft of this article, O'Shea wrote, "Kirk ''paced'' it, in his own words, for he had no ruler/measure handy, and I believe this misrepresentation has been perpetuated enough; if they were foot-on-foot, as in heel directly to toe, I would accept 57 (or 58, whatever the precise figure was), but I think perpetuating this as fact any longer is doing a disservice to science."

Roper, in his comments on the final draft of this article, was even more conservative, writing, "there are no ''confirmed'' records of giant squid longer than about 45 feet [{{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] total length. Most are in the 25–35-foot [{{convert|25|–|35|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] range. I have examined specimens in museums and laboratories around the world—perhaps a 100 or so—and I believe the 60-foot number comes from fear, fantasy, and pulling the highly elastic tentacles out to the near breaking point when they are measured on the shore or on deck."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[#Paxton2016a|Paxton (2016a)]] investigated the maximum size of ''Architeuthis'' by performing a statistical analysis using data from [[List of giant squid specimens and sightings|literature records of giant squid specimens]]. He selected what he regarded as the largest size records for each of mantle length (ML), standard length (SL), and total length (TL). Paxton's study has been criticised by giant squid experts, who have called into question the reliability of some of the selected literature records.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

For mantle length, [[#Paxton2016a|Paxton (2016a:83)]] considered the {{convert|11|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} reported by [[#Dell1952|Dell (1952:98)]] as the "longest measured", though "more reliably" the {{convert|9|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} ML specimen from [[Lyall Bay]], [[New Zealand]], documented by [[#Kirk1880|Kirk (1880:312)]].{{refn|group=nb|name=Kirk1880|[[#Kirk1880|Kirk (1880:312)]] wrote of this specimen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On 23rd of May last, the [[wikt:Ven.|Ven.]] [[Archdeacon]] Stock very kindly sent me word that three boys, named Edward R. Stock, and Frank and Walter Morrah, had that morning discovered, at [[Lyall Bay]], what they took to be a very large cuttlefish, with arms several feet long. I lost no time in proceeding to the spot, determined, if possible, to carry home the entire specimen; but judge my surprise when, on reaching the bay, I saw an animal of the size represented in the drawing now before you.* [[Victor Hugo]]'s [[Toilers of the Sea|account]] of his "[[octopus|pieuvre]]" was brought vividly to my mind, and I could not help thinking that a man would stand but a poor chance if he once got within the grasp of such a monster.&lt;br /&gt;
My first step after spreading out the arms, was to make a rough sketch and very careful measurements. I then proceeded to extract the so-called [[Gladius (cephalopod)|skeleton]], but found that some person or persons, who had visited the spot earlier than myself, had not been able to resist the temptation to try the temper of their knives upon its back, and had in consequence severed the [[Gladius (cephalopod)|cuttle-bone]] in various places. However, I was able, not only to procure all the pieces, but also the [[cephalopod beak|beak]], [[radula|tongue]], and some of the suckers, only a few of which remained, the greater portion of them having been torn off, either in some fierce encounter, or during the rough weather which had prevailed for some days previously.&lt;br /&gt;
The length of body from tip of [[cephalopod tail|tail]] to anterior margin of the mantle was 9 feet 2 inches [{{convert|9|ft|2|in|m|disp=output only}}] and 7 feet 3 inches [{{convert|7|ft|3|in|m|disp=output only}}] in circumference; the head from anterior margin of mantle to roots of arms 1-foot 11 inches [{{convert|1|ft|11|in|cm|disp=output only}}], making the total length of the body 11 feet 1 inch [{{convert|11|ft|1|in|m|disp=output only}}]. The head measured 4 feet [{{convert|4|ft|m|disp=output only}}] in circumference. The sessile arms measured 4 feet 3 inches [{{convert|4|ft|3|in|m|disp=output only}}] in length, and 11 inches [{{convert|11|in|cm|disp=output only}}] in circumference; each of these arms bore thirty-six suckers, arranged in two equal rows (as shown by the scars), and measuring from &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{13}{16}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; of an inch [{{convert|13/16|–|1/4|in|mm|disp=output only}}] in diameter; every sucker was strengthened by a bony ring armed with from forty to sixty sharp incurved teeth. The tentacular arms had been torn off at the length of 6 feet 2 inches [{{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|disp=output only}}], which was probably less than half their original length.&lt;br /&gt;
The fins were posterior, and were mere lateral expansions of the mantle, they did not extend over the back as in the case with ''[[Onychoteuthis]]'', etc.; each measured 24 inches [{{convert|24|in|cm|disp=output only}}] in length and 13 inches [{{convert|13|in|cm|disp=output only}}] in width.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Gladius (cephalopod)|cuttle bone]], when first extracted, measured 6 feet 3 inches [{{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|disp=output only}}] in length, and 11 inches [{{convert|11|in|cm|disp=output only}}] in width, but has since shrunk considerably; it was broadly lanceolate, with a hollow conical apex 1&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt; inch [{{convert|1.125|in|mm|disp=output only}}] deep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} Paxton added: "A {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} specimen from [[Mauritius]] is often mistakenly cited but consultation of the primary paper ([[#Staub1993|Staub, 1993]]) reveals an ill-defined length which is clearly not ML." The greatest measured ML of a giant squid recovered from a [[sperm whale]] is either the {{convert|2.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} reported by [[#Keil1963|Keil (1963:320)]] (though Paxton writes: "the account is confused and the 2.4&amp;nbsp;m figure probably refers to the head and ML combined") or the {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} of a specimen that had been swallowed whole off the [[Azores]], detailed by [[#Clarke1955|Clarke (1955:589)]] and [[#Clarke1956|Clarke (1956:257)]]. The "longest visually estimated" ML, according to Paxton, is the {{circa}} {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} of a specimen apparently observed in the [[North Atlantic]] off [[Portugal]], attributed to a personal communication with T. Lipington.&lt;!--see https://www.tonmo.com/threads/sighting-of-possible-large-cephalopod-near-portugal.9270/ = https://www.webcitation.org/6hsSmp9zS; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tim_lipington--&gt; A more modest {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} ML is also given, based on a sighting in the [[Indian Ocean]] sourced to the TV documentary of [[#Lynch2013|Lynch (2013)]].

For standard length (excluding the [[cephalopod limb|tentacles]]), [[#Paxton2016a|Paxton (2016a:83)]] cited the {{convert|31|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} of the "[[Three Arms]] specimen" documented by [[#Verrill1880a|Verrill (1880a:192)]] as the "longest measured". Among specimens recovered from sperm whales, the longest "definitely measured" SL is the {{convert|16|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} reported by [[#Clarke1956|Clarke (1956:257)]] and the longest "visually estimated" SL is the {{circa}} {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} attributed to a photograph of a sperm whale with giant squid remains in its jaws,&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Hansford2009|Hansford, 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; though Paxton conceded that it is "[n]ot clear how much/what portion of body was eaten". For the "longest visually estimated", more extreme supposed SLs of {{circa}} {{convert|175|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{circa}} {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} are cited to [[#Starkey1963|Starkey (1963)]] and [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis (1998a:246)]], respectively (the latter an eyewitness account by Dennis Braun). Paxton treated these last two size estimates as SLs as opposed to TLs because "squid do not generally leave their tentacles exposed except when grabbing prey and this appears to be the case for ''Architeuthis''".

For total length, [[#Paxton2016a|Paxton (2016a:83)]] considered three records as candidates for the "longest measured": the {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=on}} specimen of [[#Berzin1971|Berzin (1972:199)]], the {{convert|55|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} specimen described by [[#Kirk1888|Kirk (1888)]] as ''Architeuthis longimanus''—a strangely proportioned animal that has been much commented on{{refn|group=nb|name=longimanus|[[File:Architeuthis longimanus Kirk, 1888.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Thomas William Kirk|T. W. Kirk]]'s sketch of the ''Architeuthis longimanus'' [[type specimen]] in lateral aspect, from [[#Kirk1888|Kirk (1888)]]. Note the extreme length of the feeding tentacles relative to the mantle and arms.]][[Thomas William Kirk]] gave the following account of this specimen in his [[species description|formal description]] of ''Architeuthis longimanus'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Early last month Mr. Smith, a local fisherman, brought to the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|&lt;nowiki&gt;[Colonial]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Museum]] the beak and buccal-mass of a cuttle which had that morning been found lying on the "Big Beach" ([[Lyall Bay]]), and he assured us that the creature measured sixty-two feet [{{convert|62|ft|m|sigfig=3|disp=output only}}] in total length. I that afternoon proceeded to the spot and made a careful examination, took notes, measurements, and also obtained a sketch, which, although the terribly heavy rain and driving southerly wind rendered it impossible to do justice to the subject, will, I trust, convey to you some idea of the general outline of this most recently-arrived Devil-fish.&lt;br /&gt;
Measurements showed that, although Mr. Smith was over the mark in giving the total length as 62 feet [{{convert|62|ft|m|sigfig=3|disp=output only}}] (probably, not having a measure with him, he only stepped the distance), those figures were not so very far out; for, although the body was in all ways smaller than any of the hitherto-described New Zealand species, the enormous development of the very slight tentacular arms brought the total length up to 55 feet 2 inches [{{convert|55|ft|2|in|m|adj=on|disp=output only}}], or more than half as long again as the largest species yet recorded from these seas.&lt;br /&gt;
The length of the tentacular arms is not a very important character, as they are known to be capable of extension or retraction at the will of the animal, at least to a considerable extent.&lt;br /&gt;
[...] This specimen was a female, and to this fact may be due some of the points in which it differs from previous occurrences; but yet they are so considerable that I have no doubt a new subgenus at least will have to be created for its reception. In the meantime I place it under ''Architeuthis'', with the full knowledge, however, that it cannot possibly remain there permanently, the shape of the arms and the fins alone being sufficient to put it out of association with that genus. As soon as opportunity offers, I hope to make a further study and fully determine its affinities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirk1888|Kirk, 1888:35–36]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[#Kirk1888|Kirk (1888:38)]] provides a table with a detailed breakdown of the specimen's various measurements. There is, however, a discrepancy between the total length of 684&amp;nbsp;in ({{convert|684|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=4|disp=output only}}, or exactly 57&amp;nbsp;ft) given in the table—which agrees with the individual values of {{convert|71|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} for the mantle, {{convert|22|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} for the head, and {{convert|591|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} for the tentacles—and the total length of {{convert|55|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} given by Kirk in the body of the article.

[[#Wood1982|Wood (1982:191)]] suggested that, due to the tentacles' highly retractile nature, the total length of {{convert|62|ft|m|sigfig=3}} originally reported by the fisherman "may have been correct at the time he found the squid", and that "[t]his probably also explains the discrepancy in Kirk's figures". Owing to its small mantle size, [[#Wood1982|Wood (1982:191)]] estimated that "this specimen probably weighed less than 300&amp;nbsp;lb [{{convert|300|lb|kg|disp=output only}}]".

[[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad (2008)]] opined that the reported total length of {{convert|55|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} "simply cannot be correct" and attributed it to either "imagination" or artificial lengthening of the tentacles. They added that a female giant squid with a mantle length of {{convert|71|in|cm|abbr=on}} "measured post mortem and relaxed (by modern standards) today would have a total length of ≈32 feet [{{convert|32|ft|m|disp=output only}}]".}}—and the {{convert|55|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} "[[Thimble Tickle Bay|Thimble Tickle]] specimen" reported by [[#Verrill1880a|Verrill (1880a:191)]], which is often cited as the largest giant squid ever recorded.{{refn|group=nb|name=ThimbleTickle|The Thimble Tickle specimen, which [[Addison Emery Verrill]] referred to as his specimen No. 18,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;[[#Verrill1880a|Verrill, 1880a:191]]; [[#Verrill1880b|Verrill, 1880b:285]]&lt;/ref&gt; is often cited as the largest recorded giant squid, and has long been treated as such by [[Guinness World Records|Guinness]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Wood1982|Wood, 1982:189]]; [[#Carwardine1995|Carwardine, 1995:240]]; [[#Glenday2014|Glenday, 2014:62]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thimble Tickle squid was found aground offshore, alive, on 2 November 1878, near Little Bay Copper Mine, [[Thimble Tickle Bay|Thimble Tickle]], [[Notre Dame Bay]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]]. It was secured to a tree with a [[grapnel]] and rope and died as the tide receded. No part of the animal was retained as it was cut up for dog food. The length of the "body [..] from the beak to the extremity of the tail" (''i.e.'' mantle plus head) was said to be {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, with "one of the arms" (presumably a tentacle) measuring {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, for a total length of {{convert|55|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Reverend [[Moses Harvey]] detailed the encounter in a letter to the ''[[Boston Traveller]]'' dated 30 January 1879, which was reproduced by [[#Verrill1880a|Verrill (1880a:191–192)]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the 2d day of November last, Stephen Sherring, a fisherman residing in Thimble Tickle, not far from the locality where the other devil-fish [Verrill specimen No. 19; see [[#Verrill1880a|Verrill, 1880a:192]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, was cast ashore, was out in a boat with two other men; not far from the shore they observed some bulky object, and, supposing it might be part of a wreck, they rowed toward it, and, to their horror, found themselves close to a huge fish, having large glassy eyes, which was making desperate efforts to escape, and churning the water into foam by the motion of its immense arms and tail. It was aground and the tide was ebbing. From the funnel at the back of its head it was ejecting large volumes of water, this being its method of moving backward, the force of the stream, by the reaction of the surrounding medium, driving it in the required direction. At times the water from the siphon was black as ink.&lt;br /&gt;
Finding the monster partially disabled, the fishermen plucked up courage and ventured near enough to throw the grapnel of their boat, the sharp flukes of which, having barbed points, sunk into the soft body. To the grapnel they had attached a stout rope which they had carried ashore and tied to a tree, so as to prevent the fish from going out with the tide. It was a happy thought, for the devil fish found himself effectually moored to the shore. His struggles were terrific as he flung his ten arms about in dying agony. The fishermen took care to keep a respectful distance from the long tentacles, which ever and anon darted out like great tongues from the central mass. At length it became exhausted, and as the water receded it expired.&lt;br /&gt;
The fishermen, alas! knowing no better, proceeded to convert it into dog's meat. It was a splendid specimen—the largest yet taken—the body measuring 20 feet [{{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=2|disp=output only}}] from the beak to the extremity of the tail. It was thus exactly double the size of the New York specimen [Verrill specimen No. 14; see [[#Verrill1880a|Verrill, 1880a:189]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and five feet [{{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=2|disp=output only}}] longer than the one taken by [fisherman William] Budgell [No. 19]. The circumference of the body is not stated, but one of the arms measured 35 feet [{{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=3|disp=output only}}]. This must have been a tentacle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such is the fame of the Thimble Tickle specimen that a Giant Squid Interpretation Centre and a "life-sized",  {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} sculpture have been built near the site of its capture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hickey2009|Hickey, 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture appeared on a [[Canada|Canadian]] postage stamp issued in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hickey2010|Hickey, 2010]]; [[#stamp|[Anonymous], {{abbr|N.d.|No date}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Of the last one, Paxton wrote: "Sometimes mistakenly cited as {{convert|17.37|m|ft|abbr=on}} but the source is clear that it is 55&amp;nbsp;ft long." The first two records, particularly that of Berzin, are more questionable, as Paxton explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The accuracy of the two longest measured TLs of 19 and 16.81&amp;nbsp;m from a specimen found in the gut of a sperm whale from the Indian Ocean and from the specimen from New Zealand in 1887, respectively, should also be questioned but again are certainly not impossible. The New Zealand specimen (named ''Architeuthis longimanus'' [[#Kirk1888|Kirk, 1888]]) clearly has the largest ratio of TL to ML ever known in ''Architeuthis'' [...] which led &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to suggest that the length was paced out and/or there was extensive post-mortem stretching. However, a re-reading of the original paper suggests that the specimen, although initially paced out, was actually measured, nevertheless the TL is at the edge of the 99.9% prediction interval range [...] and so it was certainly an unusual specimen. [[#Berzin1971|Berzin's (1972)]] Indian Ocean claim is suspect because of the roundness of the figure, the lack of detailed measurements and because in an associated photo, the mantle (whose length was not given) does not look very large compared to the men in the image. Consequently&lt;!--sic--&gt; the measurement, if accurate, would represent another animal with very long tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paxton2016a|Paxton, 2016a:86]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Giant squid tentacle saved by Moses Harvey.jpg|thumb|left|The {{convert|19|ft|m|adj=on}} tentacle that fisherman Theophilus Picot hacked off a live animal on 26 October 1873. Picot estimated the total length of the squid at {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Murray1874|Murray, 1874:121]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

However, as [[#Paxton2016a|Paxton (2016a:86)]] pointed out, the genetic analysis of [[#Winkelmannetal2013|Winkelmann ''et al.'' (2013)]]—which concluded that there is likely a single, globally-distributed species of ''Architeuthis''—did not encompass these two specimens, and it is therefore possible that there exists a second, as yet unsampled, giant squid species with proportionately longer tentacles.

The {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=on}} total length of the Berzin specimen was later confirmed to be erroneous; according to Valentin Yukhov, who was involved in the specimen's discovery, it should have read {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;[[#Romanovetal2017|Romanov ''et al.'', 2017&lt;!--include page number when issue published--&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt; The misprint was reproduced in the English translation published the following year and was later propagated in a number of papers on giant squid.&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt; With the Berzin specimen not being as large as originally reported, the longest giant squid recovered from a sperm whale is the {{convert|34|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} TL individual recorded by [[#Clarke1956|Clarke (1956:257)]] (this specimen also has the longest confirmed ML and SL of any giant squid from a sperm whale).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paxton2016a|Paxton, 2016a:83]]&lt;/ref&gt; Paxton considered the "longest visually estimated" TL to be the {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} published by [[#Murray1874|Murray (1874:121)]], from an eyewitness account by fisherman Theophilus Picot, who claimed to have struck the floating animal from his boat, [[cephalopod attack|causing it to attack]]. Picot managed to hack off one of its tentacles, which was subsequently examined by a number of authors.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Murray1874|Murray, 1874]]; [[#Verrill1875a|Verrill, 1875a]]; [[#Verrill1875b|Verrill, 1875b]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the largest of all recorded giant squid specimens was the one found floating at the surface off [[Saint-Gilles, Réunion|Saint-Gilles]], [[Réunion]], on 4 March 2016.&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt; Although due to its great size the specimen could not be retrieved in its entirety, the head and arm crown were saved. Crucially, this meant the beak could be measured to estimate the mantle length and total length of the specimen. Using different [[allometric scaling]] equations,{{refn|group=nb|name=equations|[[File:Squid beak measuring.jpg|thumb|250px|Giant squid beak being measured. Isolated beaks found in the stomachs of predators such as sperm whales can be used to estimate the size of the original animal.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Roeleveld2000|Roeleveld, 2000]]; [[#Cherel2003|Cherel, 2003]]; [[#Romanovetal2017|Romanov ''et al.'', 2017]]&lt;/ref&gt;]][[#Romanovetal2017|Romanov ''et al.'' (2017)]] used the following allometric scaling equations to estimate the dorsal mantle length (DML) from the [[lower rostral length]] (LRL) of the beak, and total length (TL) from DML:
&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;LRL = 11.2 \times log_{10} DML - 19.3&lt;/math&gt; (all values in mm)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roeleveld2000|Roeleveld, 2000:185]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;DML = e^{(-1.168 + 98.031 \times LRL)}&lt;/math&gt; (all values in m)&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;[[#Paxton2016a|Paxton, 2016a:85]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TL = 0.006 + 5.117 DML&lt;/math&gt; (all values in m)&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TL = 1.59 \times DML^{1.98}&lt;/math&gt; (all values in m)&lt;ref&gt;[[#McClainetal2015|McClain ''et al.'', 2015:Table 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} the [[lower rostral length]] of the beak, at {{convert|19.74|mm|in|abbr=on}}, gave an estimated dorsal mantle length of {{convert|215.3|–|306.0|cm|ft|abbr=on}} and this, in turn, was used to estimate the total length at {{convert|11.025|–|15.664|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt;

=====Supposed sucker scars=====
[[File:Display of sperm whale and giant squid battling in the Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|A dramatisation of an underwater encounter between the sperm whale and giant squid, from a [[diorama]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
More extreme and outlandish giant squid size claims—belonging firmly in the realm of [[cryptozoology]]—have appeared in the works of authors such as [[Bernard Heuvelmans]], [[Willy Ley]], and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Sanderson1956|Sanderson, 1956]]; [[#Heuvelmans1958|Heuvelmans, 1958]]; [[#Ley1959|Ley, 1959]]&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of these gargantuan squids is often supported by reference to the giant circular scars sometimes found on [[sperm whale]]s, which are assumed to have been inflicted by the [[cephalopod sucker|suckers]] of struggling giant squid. Sometimes these claims are accompanied by extrapolations of body size based on the [[Allometry|isometric upscaling]] of a "typical" giant squid.&lt;ref&gt;[[#RoperBoss1982|Roper &amp; Boss, 1982:97]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, such scars are not necessarily of squid origin and may instead represent fungal growths or bite marks, with [[sea lamprey]]s (''Petromyzon marinus'') being one possible source.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood1982|Wood, 1982:193]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case of genuine giant squid sucker marks it is possible that subsequent skin growth has enlarged them well beyond their original dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#RoperBoss1982|Roper &amp; Boss, 1982:99]]; [[#Wood1982|Wood, 1982:192]]; [[#HaszprunarWanninger2012|Haszprunar &amp; Wanninger, 2012:R510]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A piece of sperm whale skin with Giant Squid sucker scars.JPG|thumb|left|A portion of [[sperm whale]] skin with giant squid sucker scars. In this widely reproduced image the largest sucker scars measure around an inch ({{convert|1|in|cm|disp=output only}}) across.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:143]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Nevertheless, claims of enormous sucker scars are widespread in the literature. [[Richard Ellis (biologist)|Richard Ellis]] collected some of "the more egregious examples" in his book, ''[[The Search for the Giant Squid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:142]]&lt;/ref&gt; These include the claim of [[#Dozier1976|Dozier (1976)]] that "an ordinary giant squid of 50 feet [{{convert|50|ft|m|disp=output only}}] leaves teeth-ringed sucker marks measuring between three and four inches [{{convert|3|-|4|in|cm|disp=output only}}] across on a whale, but sperm whales have been captured with tentacle marks 18 inches [{{convert|18|in|cm|disp=output only}}] across." [[L. Harrison Matthews]]'s monographic treatment of the sperm whale, published in 1938, includes the following: "Nearly all male Sperm whales carry scars caused by the suckers and claws of large squids, scars caused by suckers up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm. [{{convert|10|cm|in|disp=output only}}] in diameter being common. The claw marks take the form of scratches 2–3&amp;nbsp;m. [{{convert|2|–|3|m|ft|disp=output only}}] in length, and appear to be of more frequent occurrence than sucker marks".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Matthews1938|Matthews, 1938]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis (1998a:142)]] wrote that this 10&amp;nbsp;cm figure is "so much larger than any other recorded sucker dimensions that one suspects some sort of error, either in measuring or in transcription."

The subject was covered in some detail by [[#Wood1982|Wood (1982:192)]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Measurements of {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}, {{convert|130|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} and even {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} have been conjectured for giant squids from the size of sucker marks found on the skins of captured sperm whales, but it is dangerous to place too much reliance on this evidence. [[Addison Emery Verrill|Verrill]] says the largest suckers on the tentacles of a {{convert|32|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} long specimen measured 1{{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in [{{convert|1.25|in|cm|disp=output only}}] in diameter, and those on a 52-footer [{{convert|52|ft|m|disp=output only}}] about {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}. [[#Daniel1925|Daniel (1925)]], however, examined sucker marks on the head of one cachalot which measured 3{{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in [{{convert|3.5|in|cm|disp=output only}}] across, and others measuring up to {{convert|5|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} in diameter have been found on the skins of sperm whales captured in the North Atlantic. [[#Sanderson1956|Ivan Sanderson (1956)]] goes even further and claims that sucker marks over {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} have been found on the heads of cachalots, but he does not explain how the poor whales managed to escape from the clutches of such colossi!

The general consensus of opinion is that exceptionally large sucker marks, i.e. over {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} in diameter, are old scars that have increased in size as the sperm whale grew.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Giant squid tentacle club.jpg|thumb|One of the paired [[tentacular club]]s of ''Architeuthis'', showing the enlarged suckers of the manus, which are the largest found on any of the giant squid's [[cephalopod limb|limbs]]]]
Perhaps the most extreme published claim, ridiculed by [[#Ellis1998a|Ellis (1998a:142)]], appeared in [[Willy Ley]]'s 1959 book, ''[[Exotic Zoology]]'': "Toothed whales, vomiting in death struggle, have shown evidence of still larger [[kraken]]; in one case a 6-foot [{{convert|6|ft|m|disp=output only}}] piece of tentacle, ''with a diameter of 2 feet'' [{{convert|2|ft|m|disp=output only|sigfig=1}}; emphasis in original], has been claimed. Another claim goes for marks on the skin of such a whale, looking like the mark of a sucking disk over 2 feet [{{convert|2|ft|m|disp=output only|sigfig=1}}] in diameter".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ley1959|Ley, 1959:210]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine biologist [[Frederick Aldrich]], who personally examined more than a dozen giant squid specimens, wrote that his largest specimen from [[Newfoundland]] bore tentacular suckers "approximately two inches [{{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] in diameter" but that "[s]uckers and their toothed armament of over twelve inches [{{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] in diameter have been found in the stomachs of sperm whale&lt;!--sic--&gt; as indigestible wastes".&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;[[#Aldrich1980|Aldrich, 1980:59]]&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to entertain the idea of giant squid over {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} long,{{refn|group=nb|name=Aldrich|Aldrich restated this belief in "Monsters of the Deep", the second episode of the 1980 television series ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'': "I believe the giant squid reach an approximate maximum size of something like one hundred and fifty feet [{{convert|150|ft|m|disp=output only}}]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:6–7]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ellis (biologist)|Richard Ellis]], apparently unaware of Aldrich's similar statements in print, commented: "It is difficult to imagine why Aldrich would have made such an irresponsible statement, unless it had to do with being on camera".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:7]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur C. Clarke]] himself once remarked: "it would be strange indeed if the world's biggest squid had been among the very few cast ashore to be examined and measured by naturalists. There may well be specimens more than a hundred feet [{{convert|100|ft|m|disp=output only}}] in length."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:6]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} and even to suggest a [[binomial name]] for this super-sized species, were it ever to be discovered: ''Architeuthis halpertius''.&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;

By comparison, giant squid suckers ''normally'' reach a maximum diameter of only a few centimetres. Based on a detailed examination of a number of large specimens from New Zealand waters, [[#Forch1998|Förch (1998:55)]] wrote that "[t]he largest suckers [...] on the sessile arms are a very constant {{convert|21|–|24|mm|in|disp=sqbr|sigfig=2}} in external diameter". In giant squid the largest suckers of all are found on the central portion of the [[tentacular club]], called the ''[[wikt:manus|manus]]'', and among the specimens examined by [[#Forch1998|Förch (1998:53)]] these reached a maximum diameter of {{convert|28|–|32|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. [[#Clarke1980|Clarke (1980)]] wrote: "I have not yet seen conclusive evidence to suggest that sucker scars are larger than {{convert|3.7|cm|in|disp=sqbr|sigfig=3}} across".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:142]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[#RoperBoss1982|Roper &amp; Boss (1982:97)]], the largest suckers of the tentacular clubs reach {{convert|5.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.

=====Mass estimates=====
[[File:Lifting giant squid in tarp.jpg|thumb|left|A dozen people attempting to move a [[giant squid]] weighing in excess of {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Feldman1999|Feldman, 1999]] for more on this specimen&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It is now accepted that the giant squid has [[#Mass 2|a maximum mass of several hundred kilograms]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#OShea2003a|O'Shea, 2003a]]; [[#RoperJereb2010a|Roper &amp; Jereb, 2010a:121]]&lt;/ref&gt; but the literature is rife with claims of much greater weights. [[#Clarke1966|Clarke (1966)]], for example, put the mass of the largest giant squid specimens at around {{convert|1|tonne|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Alexander1998|Alexander, 1998:1233]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Richard Ellis (biologist)|Richard Ellis]] wrote: "Where [giant] squid carcasses have actually been weighed, it appears that the longest ones—in the 50-foot [{{convert|50|ft|m|disp=output only}}] range, for example—weigh about a ton [{{convert|1|short ton|kg|disp=output only}}]."&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:106]]&lt;/ref&gt; Much greater estimates of giant squid mass can be found in, for example, ''Natural History of Marine Animals'' by [[#MacGinitieMacGinitie1949|MacGinitie &amp; MacGinitie (1949)]]: "two arms of ''Architeuthis'' that were {{convert|42|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} long were found, and if one reconstructed a body [...] the squid to which these arms belonged was {{convert|4.6|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} in diameter and {{convert|24|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} long, with an overall measurement of {{convert|66|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}. It would have weighed about 42{{frac|1|2}} tons [{{convert|42.5|short ton|tonne|abbr=off|disp=output only}}]." They added that a {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} specimen, such as the one reported from [[Thimble Tickle Bay|Thimble Tickle]],{{refn|group=nb|name=ThimbleTickle}} "would have weighed 29{{frac|1|4}} or 30 tons [{{convert|29.25|or|30|short ton|tonne|sigfig=3|abbr=off|disp=output only}}] including the tentacles—a truly noble animal, being a little more than one-fifth the weight of the [[blue whale|largest whale]] and larger than the [[whale shark]]s and [[basking shark]]s, the largest of all fishes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGinitieMacGinitie1949|MacGinitie &amp; MacGinitie, 1949]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis characterised these estimates as "unfounded exaggerations".&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; In the revised edition of ''Natural History of Marine Animals'', published in 1968, the authors reduced their estimate to less than 8 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGinitieMacGinitie1968|MacGinitie &amp; MacGinitie, 1968]]; [[#Wood1982|Wood, 1982:190]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Heuvelmans]] believed that "there must be ''Architeuthis'' weighing more than 5 tons, and some even larger ones which must weigh between 2 and 27 tons, the normal weight being around 8 tons. There are good reasons to believe that there may even exist specimens twice as long as that of Thimble Tickle, which, depending upon their girth, might have weighed between 16 and 216 tons, but more likely around 64 tons."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heuvelmans1958|Heuvelmans, 1958]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis, who considered these estimates "utterly ridiculous", wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Heuvelmans commits a fundamental error in calculating the weight of some of these monsters when he writes that "the density of living creatures is only slightly higher than that of water ... a decimetre of living flesh weighs about as much as a litre of water." That may be true for some other living creatures, but the flesh of ''Architeuthis'', saturated with [[ammonium chloride]], is ''lighter'' than water, and the giant squid is [[Neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]]. (This is believed to be the reason that dead or dying squid are found floating at the surface or washed up on the beach.) His assumption, therefore, that the 55-foot-long [{{convert|55|ft|m|disp=output only}}] Thimble Tickle squid would have "probably weighed near 24 tons" is patently erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:107]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the subject of the Thimble Tickle specimen's mass, [[#Wood1982|Wood (1982:190)]] referred to the work of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] zoologist and writer [[Igor Akimushkin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Dr [[#Akimushkin1963&lt;!--sic--&gt;|Igor Akimushkin (1965)]], the Russian teuthologist, a {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} long giant squid will weigh 1 tonne [{{convert|1|tonne|lb|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] if the head, mantle and arms combined make up half the total length. Since there is a [[Cube (algebra)|cubic]] relationship between the linear dimensions of ''Architeuthis'' and its volume or weight, this means the Thimble Tickle monster must have scaled about 2.8 tonnes [{{convert|2.8|tonne|lb|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] (i.e. the weight of a large bull [[hippopotamus]]), although 2 tonnes [{{convert|2|tonne|lb|abbr=on|disp=output only}}] is probably a more realistic figure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Giant Pacific octopus====
The maximum size of the [[giant Pacific octopus]] (''Enteroctopus dofleini'') has long been a source of debate in the scientific community, with dubious reports of specimens weighing hundreds of kilograms.

In 1885, reporting on the longest octopus specimen reliably recorded up to that point, renowned [[Malacology|malacologist]] [[William Healey Dall]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1874 I speared an octopus in the harbor of [[Iliuliuk]], [[Unalashka]], which was afterward hung, by a cord tied around the body immediately behind the arms, to one of the [[stern]] [[davit]]s of the coast survey vessel under my command. As soon as the animal died and the muscles relaxed, I noticed that the tips of the longer tentacles just touched the water. On measuring the distance with a cord, I found it to be sixteen feet [{{convert|16|ft|m|disp=output only}}], giving the creature a spread from tip to tip of the longest pair of arms, of not less than thirty-two feet [{{convert|32|ft|m|disp=output only}}]. The arms toward the tips were all exceedingly slender, but rather stout toward the body, which was somewhat over a foot [{{convert|1|ft|cm|disp=output only}}] long. The largest suckers were two and a half inches [{{convert|2.5|in|cm|disp=output only}}] in diameter; the whole creature nearly filled a large washtub. Parts of this specimen are now in the [[National Museum of Natural History|U. S. national museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dall1885|Dall, 1885:432]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an article for the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] summarising knowledge on the giant Pacific octopus, [[#High1976|High (1976:17–18)]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several octopuses in excess of 100 pounds [{{convert|100|lb|kg|disp=output only}}] have been encountered and captured. Much larger ones have been reported but, like the [[Loch Ness Monster]], these usually elude the careful photographer or scientist. Most octopuses weigh less than 70 pounds [{{convert|70|lb|kg|disp=output only}}] with a stretched length of 15 feet [{{convert|15|ft|m|disp=output only}}] or less. Overall length between arms is not a suitable measure because of the animal's unusual elasticity.

In the late 1950s, I interviewed a Canadian commercial diver, Jock MacLean of [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], [[British Columbia|B.C.]] He reported capturing an immense creature weighing 600 pounds [{{convert|600|lb|kg|sigfig=3|disp=output only}}] and measuring 32 feet [{{convert|32|ft|m|disp=output only}}] from arm tip to top. MacLean's photographs, unfortunately, were of poor quality. Smaller animals, to 400 pounds [{{convert|400|lb|kg|sigfig=3|disp=output only}}], were occasionally taken in his commercial octopus fishing endeavor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[#HochbergFields1980|Hochberg &amp; Fields (1980:436)]] referenced the same specimen, writing: "the largest specimen on record with a total arm spread of 9.6&amp;nbsp;m [{{convert|9.6|m|ft|disp=output only}}] and a weight of 272&amp;nbsp;kg [{{convert|272|kg|lb|disp=output only}}]". These figures are only estimates, however, as—contrary to the above quotation from [[#High1976|High (1976:17–18)]]—it appears that this specimen was never collected and measured.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; Murray Newman, director of the [[Vancouver Aquarium]] for 37 years, quoted Jock MacLean in his 1994 memoir, ''Life in a Fishbowl'': "Next year [1957] in the same place, I saw one, maybe thirty-two feet [{{convert|32|ft|m|disp=output only}}] across and six hundred pounds [{{convert|600|lb|kg|sigfig=3|disp=output only}}]. Didn't go for her, though, no place to keep her!"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newman1994|Newman, 1994:66]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[false precision|misleadingly precise]] [[metric system|metric]] [[Conversion of units|conversion]] of 272&amp;nbsp;kg (for 600&amp;nbsp;lb) and the ''im''precise conversion of 9.6&amp;nbsp;m (for 32&amp;nbsp;ft; naively employing a [[conversion factor]] of 0.3 instead of [[Foot (unit)|0.3048]]) gained wide acceptance as the maximum recorded dimensions of the giant Pacific octopus, and have been much repeated.{{refn|group=nb|name=Bavendam|An example from the May 2000 issue of ''Diver'' magazine reads: "The generally accepted record was of awesome proportions, weighing 272kg and with an arm span of 9.6m."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bavendam2000|Bavendam, 2000:63–64]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jock MacLean is also reported to have ''captured'' a {{convert|198|kg|lb|abbr=on}} animal with an arm span of {{convert|8.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} near [[Port Hardy]], [[British Columbia]], in March 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newman1994|Newman, 1994:66]]; [[#CosgroveMcDaniel2009|Cosgrove &amp; McDaniel, 2009:66–67]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another giant specimen was caught off [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], in 1945. Its weight was recorded as {{convert|182.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the surviving photograph makes it possible to estimate its total length at more than {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} and arm span at {{convert|6|–|6.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; In a book dedicated to the giant Pacific octopus, [[#CosgroveMcDaniel2009|Cosgrove &amp; McDaniel (2009:72)]] summarised knowledge on the species's maximum size as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The specimen William Dall speared in 1885 {{sic}} at Iliuliuk had the largest radial span of any giant Pacific octopus ever measured. Jock MacLean's 1956 Port Hardy behemoth was the biggest ever weighed. The Santa Barbara specimen photographed in 1945 was the second heaviest. It would appear that octopuses weighing as much as {{convert|272|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and with radial spans of over {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} are within the realm of possibility, but have never actually been documented by both measuring and weighing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Possible diminution in size=====
No specimens approaching these extreme sizes have been reported since the middle of the 20th century. This lack of giant individuals is corroborated by commercial octopus fishers; none of those interviewed by [[#CosgroveMcDaniel2009|Cosgrove &amp; McDaniel (2009)]] had caught a single animal weighing more than {{convert|57|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in the previous 20 years, among many thousands harvested over that period.&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt; Octopus specialist Roland Anderson, a biologist with the [[Seattle Aquarium]] for more than 30 years, had long sought, unsuccessfully, to find a giant Pacific octopus weighing more than {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. In an attempt to raise a truly enormous specimen, Anderson fed a number of captive males ''[[ad libitum]]''. The heaviest animal (nicknamed 'Big') attained a peak weight of {{convert|43|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and its largest suckers measured {{convert|7.9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson2003|Anderson, 2003:2]]; [[#CosgroveMcDaniel2009|Cosgrove &amp; McDaniel, 2009:71]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson suggested the species might now be maturing at a smaller size as a result of [[toxicant]] [[bioaccumulation]], which could explain the lack of truly gigantic specimens in recent times. In particular, high concentrations of [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] have been identified in the [[digestive gland]]s of wild giant Pacific octopuses, likely originating from their preferred prey, the [[Cancer productus|red rock crab]] (''Cancer productus'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson2003|Anderson, 2003:3]]; [[#CosgroveMcDaniel2009|Cosgrove &amp; McDaniel, 2009:71]]; [[#ScheelAnderson2012|Scheel &amp; Anderson, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary study found that aquarium animals fed equal quantities of raw sea food and live ''C.&amp;nbsp;productus'' (caught locally in [[Elliott Bay]]) matured at a smaller size, reached a lower maximum weight ({{convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} mean), and had higher concentrations of most heavy metals, than those fed solely on raw sea food ({{convert|36|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} mean, including the aforementioned {{convert|43|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} specimen).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson2003|Anderson, 2003:2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Largest species by measure===
Cephalopod size can be quantified in various ways. Some of the most common size measures are covered below. The following four tables list only extant species; [[#Extinct taxa 3|extinct taxa are treated separately at the end]].

====Mantle length====
[[File:Giant squid with Clyde Roper.jpg|thumb|250px|Teuthologist [[Clyde Roper]] lying alongside a large [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis dux'') specimen of almost {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} ML]]

The list of largest cephalopods by mantle length is dominated by squids, with more than twenty species exceeding the largest-bodied octopuses and cuttlefish. The largest of all is the [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'') with an estimated maximum mantle length of {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} ([[#RoperJereb2010c|Roper &amp; Jereb, 2010c:173]]). Even greater mantle lengths have historically been reported for the [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis dux''), but these have been discredited (see [[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]).

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Russian vessel ''Novoulianovsk'', working in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in 1984, brought up the remains of a gigantic specimen of ''[[Galiteuthis phyllura]]'' from a depth of one thousand to thirteen hundred meters (thirty-three hundred to forty-three hundred feet), and [[#Nesis1985|Nesis (1985)]] said that it was "almost as large as ''[[Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni]]'' (of the same family)."  Only an arm and a tentacle were collected, but they were so large (the arm was 40&amp;nbsp;cm long [15.6 inches] and the tentacle &lt;!--CheckCM--&gt;{{convert|115|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) that Nesis was able to estimate the mantle length at {{convert|265|to|275|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, and the total length at over 4 meters (more than 13 feet). "Because of its narrow body," wrote Nesis, "we conclude that its mass is consistently lower than that of the other large squids."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[#RoperJereb2010c|Roper &amp; Jereb (2010c:165)]] questioned the validity of this record, writing: "this is considered a doubtful record that might refer to total length; probably the maximum mantle length is less than 400 to 500&amp;nbsp;mm". But [[Steve O'Shea]] commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The late, great [[Kir Nesis]] was not one to exaggerate, and must have had very good reason to cite a possible mantle length of 2.7m [{{convert|2.7|m|ft|disp=output only}}] for ''Galiteuthis phyllura''. Not only would such a monstrous mantle render this the 'largest species of ''[[Galiteuthis]]''', but it would give the species a mantle that was considerably longer than that of ''Architeuthis'', and marginally longer (0.2m [{{convert|0.2|m|ft|disp=output only}}]) than the submature Colossal Squid (''Mesonychoteuthis'') we reported last year [in 2003].&lt;br /&gt;
What amazes me is that the adult has never made the press (that I am aware of). Even if ''Galiteuthis'' lacks hooks on the arms it would still be a most frightening squid to bump into in the abyss.

The longest scientifically documented specimens belong to the [[giant squid]], with a maximum total length of {{convert|14|–|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} ([[#RoperShea2013|Roper &amp; Shea, 2013:114]]). Despite its proportionally shorter tentacles, the [[colossal squid]] may rival the giant squid in total length, but the species's size limits are uncertain because only a handful of mature specimens have been recorded.

Of the nearly 100 specimens examined by [[Clyde Roper|Roper]], the largest was "46 feet (14&amp;nbsp;m) long" ([[#CerulloRoper2012|Cerullo &amp; Roper, 2012:22]]). [[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad (2008)]] give a maximum total length of 13&amp;nbsp;m for females based on the examination of more than 130 specimens, measured ''post mortem'' and relaxed, as well as beaks recovered from [[sperm whale]]s (which do not exceed the size of those found in the largest complete specimens). [[Steve O'Shea|O'Shea]] estimated the maximum total length for males at 10&amp;nbsp;m ([[#OShea2003a|O'Shea, 2003a]]).

Older records of 18&amp;nbsp;m or more were likely exaggerated by stretching of the long [[cephalopod limb|feeding tentacles]] or resulted from inadequate measurement methods such as pacing ([[#OSheaBolstad2008|O'Shea &amp; Bolstad, 2008]]; [[#RoperShea2013|Roper &amp; Shea, 2013:113]]).

The heaviest known cephalopod, and the largest living invertebrate, is the [[colossal squid]]. The largest recorded specimen of this species, caught in the [[Ross Sea]] in 2007, weighed {{convert|495|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. However, its beak is not the largest known from this species; even bigger colossal squid beaks have been recovered from the stomachs of [[sperm whale]]s, indicating that this species can grow larger still.

[[File:Spirula fg1.jpg|thumb|250px|Two examples of the small internal shell of ''[[Spirula spirula]]'']]
[[Nautilus]]es are the only extant [[cephalopod]]s with a true external shell; in other groups the shell has been internalised or lost completely. Internal shells include the [[cuttlebone]]s of cuttlefish, the [[Gladius (cephalopod)|gladii]] of squids and the vampire squid, the [[Cirrate shell|winged shells]] of cirrate octopods, and the spiral shells of ''[[Spirula]]''. Additionally, females of the octopus genus ''[[Argonauta]]'' secrete a specialised paper-thin eggcase in which they reside, and this is popularly regarded as a "shell", although it is not attached to the body of the animal (see [[#Finn2013|Finn, 2013]]).

Cephalopod shell diameter is of interest to [[teuthologist]]s and [[conchologist]]s alike. The ''[[Registry of World Record Size Shells]]'', the most comprehensive publication on maximum shell size in marine molluscs, specifies that specimens "should be measured with [[vernier calipers|vernier type calipers]] and should reflect the greatest measurable dimension of the shell in any direction including any processes of hard shell material produced by the animal (i.e. spines, wings, keels, siphonal canals, etc.) and not including attachments, [[barnacle]]s, [[coralline algae]], or any other encrusting organisms" ([[#Pisor2008|Pisor, 2008:14]]). Unlike most other measures of cephalopod size, shell diameter can be determined with a high degree of precision and usually leaves little room for ambiguity. For this reason it is usually recorded to the nearest one-tenth of a millimetre ({{convert|0.1|mm|in|disp=output only}}), as is standard in [[conchology]].

When the ''[[Registry of World Record Size Shells]]'' changed ownership in 2008 it was launched as an online database in addition to its print publication. Subsequent rule changes meant that all records required photographic verification. Over time, older records for which photographic evidence could not be obtained were removed from the database. As a result, some records from older editions of the registry actually exceed the size of the current official record holders, sometimes by considerable margins. Where this has occurred, the largest recorded size across all editions is shown first and any discrepancies or competing records are noted thereafter. Where a reliable literature record surpasses all specimens ever included in the registry, this is given instead and the registry record(s) noted thereafter. [[#Pisor2008|Pisor (2008)]] was the fifth and final print edition of the registry published prior to the rule change, and [[#WRS|Barbier ''et al.'' ({{abbr|N.d.|No date}})]] is the current, continuously updated online database. The registry only covers the shells of [[nautilus]]es and ''[[Spirula]]'' and the eggcases of ''[[Argonauta]]''.

===Eyes===

[[File:Giant squid eye.jpg|thumb|250px|Preserved giant squid eye]]
[[File:Deep sea squid.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gonatus]]'' sp. swimming past a submersible during a dive to the [[Kermadec Arc]] off [[New Zealand]]. [[Gonatidae|Gonatids]] such as this have proportionately slightly larger eyes than do giant squid.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;[[#Schmitzetal2013a|Schmitz ''et al.'', 2013a]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[giant squid|giant]] and [[colossal squid]]s have the largest recorded [[cephalopod eye|eyes]] of any living animal, with a maximum diameter of at least {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[pupil]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; This is three times the size of the largest [[fish]] eyes—up to {{convert|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} in [[swordfish]]—and more than twice the diameter of the largest [[whale]] eyes—up to {{convert|109|mm|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|55|mm|in|abbr=on}} in [[blue whale|blue]], [[humpback whale|humpback]], and [[sperm whale]]s, respectively—which are the largest among [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; A large colossal squid caught in 2014 and dissected at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] had eyes some {{convert|35|–|37|cm|in|abbr=on}} across.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Farquhar2014|Farquhar, 2014]]; [[#TePapa2014|[Te Papa], 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are unconfirmed reports from the 19th century of giant squid eyes up to {{convert|40|cm|ft|abbr=on}} across.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LandNilsson2012|Land &amp; Nilsson, 2012:86]]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the extinct [[ichthyosaur]]s are known to have approached these dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Motanietal1999|Motani ''et al.'', 1999]]; [[#HumphriesRuxton2002|Humphries &amp; Ruxton, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; with some species having eyes up to {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nilssonetal2012|Nilsson ''et al.'', 2012:687]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their size, the eyes of giant and colossal squids do not appear to be disproportionately large; they do not deviate significantly from the [[allometry|allometric relationship]] seen across other squid species.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schmitzetal2013a|Schmitz ''et al.'', 2013a:45]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sepiolidae|Sepiolids]] are noted for having exceptionally large eyes, which are much bigger relative to their mantle length than those of the giant squid; the same is true of ''[[Histioteuthis]]'' species.&lt;ref name=":27"/&gt; [[Gonatidae|Gonatids]] and the [[Loliginidae|loliginids]] ''[[Loligo]]'' and ''[[Lolliguncula]]'' also have proportionately somewhat larger eyes than ''Architeuthis''.&lt;ref name=":27"/&gt; Some sources state that the [[vampire squid]] (''Vampyroteuthis infernalis'') has the largest eyes of any animal relative to its size, with a {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} specimen having eyes around {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1996|Ellis, 1996:177]]; [[#Anonymous2005a|[Anonymous], 2005a]]; though see [[#Youngetal2015|Young ''et al.'', 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iridoteuthis iris.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Iridoteuthis iris]]'' is an extreme example of a [[Sepiolidae|sepiolid]] with disproportionately large eyes]]
&lt;!--[[File:Euprymna scolopes - image.pbio.v12.i02.g001.png|thumb|left|250px|''[[Euprymna scolopes]]'', the Hawaiian bobtail squid]]--&gt;

There is some debate in the scientific community as to the evolutionary reason behind the extremely large eyes of giant and colossal squids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Partridge2012|Partridge, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Nilssonetal2012|Nilsson ''et al.'' (2012)]] and [[#Nilssonetal2013|Nilsson ''et al.'' (2013)]] argue that it is an [[anti-predator adaptation]] for enhanced detection of [[sperm whale]]s, with the squids picking up [[plankton]] [[bioluminescence]] triggered by moving whales, perhaps from distances exceeding {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[#Schmitzetal2013a|Schmitz ''et al.'' (2013a)]] and [[#Schmitzetal2013b|Schmitz ''et al.'' (2013b)]] contend that their eyes are so large due to a [[phylogenetically conserved]] developmental pattern that governs the relative dimensions of squids and their eyes, and that any [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] benefits their size may confer in terms of predator avoidance are the result of [[exaptation]] ("pre-adaptation").

===Neurons===

[[Squid giant axon]]s can exceed {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter: 100 to 1000 times the thickness of [[mammal]]ian [[axon]]s.&lt;!--REF--&gt; The axons of the [[Humboldt squid]] (''Dosidicus gigas'') are exceptional in that they can reach a diameter of as much as {{convert|1.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and those of ''[[Loligo forbesii]]'' can also exceed 1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;[[#AdelmanGilbert1990|Adelman &amp; Gilbert, 1990:102]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the importance of Humboldt squid to [[electrophysiology]] research that when the animals migrated out of reach of [[Chile]]an fishermen in the 1970s "it led to the demise of a world-class electrophysiology laboratory" based there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scully2008|Scully, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Squid giant axon diameters do not necessarily correlate with overall body size; those of the [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis dux'') are only {{convert|0.137|–|0.21|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=":28"/&gt;

[[File:RL squid 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram showing the three major elements (red, green, and yellow) of the squid giant neuronal system. The arrows indicate the direction of transmission from the head ganglion towards the mantle. The funnel (light blue) is the site of rapid water expulsion following mantle contraction.]]

The [[squid giant synapse]] is the largest [[chemical synapse|chemical junction]] in nature.&lt;!--REF--&gt; It lies in the stellate [[ganglion]] on each side of the midline, at the posterior wall of the squid's muscular mantle. Activation of this synapse triggers a synchronous contraction of the mantle musculature, causing the forceful ejection of a jet of water from the mantle. This [[jet propulsion|water propulsion]] allows the squid to move rapidly through the water and, in the case of the so-called 'flying squids', even to jump through the surface of the water (breaking the air–water barrier) to escape predators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arata1954|Arata, 1954]]; [[#Murata1988|Murata, 1988]]; [[#Maciaetal2004|Maciá ''et al.'', 2004]]; [[#Muramatsuetal2013|Muramatsu ''et al.'', 2013]]; [[#ODoretal2013|O'Dor ''et al.'', 2013]]&lt;!--[[pleuston]]; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hCa0sEJl_4--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many essential elements of how all chemical synapses function were first discovered by studying the squid giant synapse.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Llinas1999|Llinás, 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photophores===

''[[Taningia danae]]'', a very large [[Octopoteuthidae|octopoteuthid]] squid, possesses "lemon-sized" yellow [[photophore]]s at the tips of two of its [[cephalopod limb|arms]], which are the largest known light-emitting organs in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis1998a|Ellis, 1998a:149]]; [[#Barrat2015|Barrat, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; Video footage shot in 2005 in deep water off [[Japan]] shows ''T.&amp;nbsp;danae'' emitting blinding [[Bioluminescence|flashes]] of light from these photophores as it attacks its prey.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Kuboderaetal2006|Kubodera ''et al.'', 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of muscular lids surrounds each photophore and it is the withdrawal of these lids that produces the flashes. A large individual filmed from a remote submersible off [[Hawaii]] in 2015 can clearly be seen opening the lids to reveal its photophores.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Barrat2015|Barrat, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that this highly manoeuvrable squid uses bright flashes to disorientate potential prey. The flashes may also serve to illuminate prey for easier capture or play a role in courtship and/or territorial displays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kuboderaetal2006|Kubodera ''et al.'', 2006:1033]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5936" xml:space="preserve">'''Chaperome''' refers to the ensemble of all cellular molecular [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]] and [[co-chaperone]] proteins that assist [[protein folding]] of [[misfolded proteins]] or folding intermediates in order to ensure native protein folding and function, to antagonize aggregation-related [[proteotoxicity]] and ensuing protein loss-of-function or protein misfolding-diseases such as the neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's, Huntington's or Parkinson's disease, as well as to safeguard cellular [[proteostasis]] and proteome balance.&lt;ref name = Balch&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=18276881 |vauthors=Balch WE, Morimoto RI, Dillin A, Kelly JW | title=Adapting proteostasis for disease intervention | journal=Science | volume=319 |issue=5865 | date= Feb 2008 |pages=916–919 | doi=10.1126/science.1141448|bibcode=2008Sci...319..916B |s2cid=20952037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Douglas&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4161/pri.3.2.8587 | last1 = Douglas | first1 = P.

The term chaperome was first coined in a 2006 publication in Cell by Balch and co-workers on the finding that down-regulation of the Hsp90 co-chaperone Aha1 rescues misfolding of CFTR in cystic fibrosis to describe the overall chaperone folding environment, or the "chaperome".&lt;ref name =Wang&gt;{{cite journal | pmid= 17110338  |vauthors=Wang X, etal | title=Hsp90 cochaperone Aha1 down regulation rescues misfolding of CFTR in cystic fibrosis| journal=Cell| volume=127 |issue=4 | date=2006 |pages=803–15 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.09.043|s2cid=1457851 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Brehme and co-workers systematically studied the expression dynamics of the full human chaperome comprising ~300 human chaperones and co-chaperones in human aging brains and in brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Integration with chaperome-wide functional RNA interference (RNAi) perturbation experiments in worm and in human cells led to the identification of a chaperome sub-network that safeguards [[proteostasis]] in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;ref name =Brehme&gt;{{cite journal | pmid= 25437566 |pmc=4255334 |vauthors=Brehme M, etal | title=A conserved chaperome sub-network safeguards protein homeostasis in aging and neurodegenerative disease| journal=Cell Rep.| volume=9 |issue=3 | date=2014 |pages=1135–1150 | doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a comprehensive literature survey reviewed the literature since the release of the human genome sequence in 2000 for systematic studies in small animal model systems and highlighted the power of model systems to unveil those key chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity out of the large number represented in the wider human chaperome that could inform targets and strategies for therapeutic regulation of chaperone functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Brehme M, Voisine C | title=Model systems of protein-misfolding diseases reveal chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity| journal=Dis.

[[File:DNA Diagram.png|thumb|right|upright=1.55|A diagram of DNA base pairing, demonstrating the basis for Chargaff's rules.]]
'''Chargaff's rules''' state that in the [[DNA]] of any species and any organism, the amount of [[guanine]] should be equal to the amount of [[cytosine]] and the amount of [[adenine]] should be equal to the amount of [[thymine]]. Further a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of [[purine]] and [[pyrimidine]] bases (i.e., &lt;code&gt;A+G=T+C&lt;/code&gt;) should exist. This pattern is found in both strands of the DNA. They were discovered by Austrian-born chemist [[Erwin Chargaff]],&lt;ref name="Elson1952"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02170221 |vauthors=Elson D, Chargaff E |year=1952 |title=On the deoxyribonucleic acid content of sea urchin gametes |journal=Experientia |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=143–145 |pmid=14945441|s2cid=36803326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chargaff1952"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chargaff E, Lipshitz R, Green C |s2cid=11358561 |year=1952 |title=Composition of the deoxypentose nucleic acids of four genera of sea-urchin |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=155–160 |doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(19)50884-5 |pmid=14938364|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1940s.

=== First parity rule ===
The first rule holds that a double-stranded [[DNA]] molecule,  ''globally'' has percentage base pair equality: A% = T% and G% = C%. The rigorous validation of the rule constitutes the basis of [[Watson-Crick base pair|Watson-Crick pairs]] in the DNA double helix model.

=== Second parity rule ===
The second rule holds that both Α%≈ Τ% and G% ≈ C% are valid for each of the two DNA strands.&lt;ref name=Rudner1968&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4970114|year=1968|last1=Rudner|first1=R|last2=Karkas|first2=JD|last3=Chargaff|first3=E|title=Separation of ''B.

== Research ==
The second parity rule was discovered in 1968.&lt;ref name=Rudner1968 /&gt; It states that, in single-stranded DNA, the number of adenine units is ''approximately'' equal to that of thymine (%A &lt;span&gt;≈&lt;/span&gt; %T), and the number of cytosine units is ''approximately'' equal to that of guanine (%C &lt;span&gt;≈&lt;/span&gt; %G).

The first empirical generalization of Chargaff's second parity rule, called the Symmetry Principle, was proposed by Vinayakumar V. Prabhu &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prabhu VV |year=1993 |title=Symmetry observation in long nucleotide sequences |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=2797–2800|doi=10.1093/nar/21.12.2797 |pmid=8332488 |pmc=309655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993. This principle states that for any given oligonucleotide, its frequency is approximately equal to the frequency of its complementary reverse oligonucleotide. A theoretical generalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Yamagishi MEB |date= 2017|title= Mathematical Grammar of Biology |publisher= Springer| series=SpringerBriefs in Mathematics |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-62689-5|arxiv= 1112.1528|isbn= 978-3-319-62688-8|s2cid= 16742066}}&lt;/ref&gt; was mathematically derived by Michel E. B. Yamagishi and Roberto H. Herai in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Yamagishi MEB, Herai RH |year=2011 |title=Chargaff's "Grammar of Biology": New Fractal-like Rules|series=SpringerBriefs in Mathematics |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-62689-5 |arxiv = 1112.1528|isbn=978-3-319-62688-8 |s2cid=16742066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, it was shown that this rule applies to four&lt;ref name="Chargaff1952" /&gt; of the five types of double stranded genomes; specifically it applies to the [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[chromosomes]], the [[bacteria]]l chromosomes, the double stranded [[DNA]] viral genomes, and the [[archaea]]l chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.11.160 |vauthors=Mitchell D, Bridge R |year=2006 |title=A test of Chargaff's second rule |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume=340 |issue=1 |pages=90–94 |pmid=16364245}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not apply to [[Organellar DNA|organellar genomes]] ([[mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s) smaller than ~20-30 [[basepair|kbp]], nor does it apply to single stranded DNA (viral) genomes or any type of [[RNA]] genome. The basis for this rule is still under investigation, although genome size may play a role.
[[File:Chargaff-2nd-histogram.png|thumb|right|Histogram showing how 20309 chromosomes adhere to Chargaff's second parity rule]]
The rule itself has consequences. In most bacterial genomes (which are generally 80-90% coding) genes are arranged in such a fashion that approximately 50% of the coding sequence lies on either strand. [[Wacław Szybalski]], in the 1960s, showed that in [[bacteriophage]] coding sequences [[purines]] (A and G) exceed [[pyrimidines]] (C and T).&lt;ref name=Szybalski1966&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szybalski W, Kubinski H, Sheldrick O |year=1966 |title=Pyrimidine clusters on the transcribing strand of DNA and their possible role in the initiation of RNA synthesis |journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol |volume=31 |pages=123–127 |pmid=4966069 |doi=10.1101/SQB.1966.031.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule has since been confirmed in other organisms and should probably be now termed "[[Szybalski's rule]]". While Szybalski's rule generally holds, exceptions are known to exist.&lt;ref name=Cristillo1998&gt;{{cite book |author=Cristillo AD |year=1998 |title=Characterization of G0/G1 switch genes in cultured T lymphocytes |work=PhD thesis |publisher=Queen's University |location=Kingston, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell1999&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1998.0858 |vauthors=Bell SJ, Forsdyke DR |year=1999 |title=Deviations from Chargaff's second parity rule correlate with direction of transcription |journal=J Theor Biol |volume=197 |issue=1 |pages=63–76 |pmid=10036208|bibcode=1999JThBi.197...63B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lao2000&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/gr.10.2.228 |vauthors=Lao PJ, Forsdyke DR |year=2000 |title=Thermophilic Bacteria Strictly Obey Szybalski's Transcription Direction Rule and Politely Purine-Load RNAs with Both Adenine and Guanine |journal= Genome Research|volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=228–236 |pmid=10673280 |pmc=310832}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological basis for Szybalski's rule, like Chargaff's, is not yet known.

The combined effect of Chargaff's second rule and Szybalski's rule can be seen in bacterial genomes where the coding sequences are not equally distributed. The [[genetic code]] has 64 [[codons]] of which 3 function as termination codons: there are only 20 [[amino acid]]s normally present in proteins. (There are two uncommon amino acids—[[selenocysteine]] and [[pyrrolysine]]—found in a limited number of proteins and encoded by the [[stop codon]]s—TGA and TAG respectively.) The mismatch between the number of codons and amino acids allows several codons to code for a single amino acid - such codons normally differ only at the third codon base position.

Multivariate statistical analysis of codon use within genomes with unequal quantities of coding sequences on the two strands has shown that codon use in the third position depends on the strand on which the gene is located. This seems likely to be the result of Szybalski's and Chargaff's rules. Because of the asymmetry in pyrimidine and purine use in coding sequences, the strand with the greater coding content will tend to have the greater number of purine bases (Szybalski's rule). Because the number of purine bases will, to a very good approximation, equal the number of their complementary pyrimidines within the same strand and, because the coding sequences occupy 80-90% of the strand, there appears to be (1) a selective pressure on the third base to minimize the number of purine bases in the strand with the greater coding content; and (2) that this pressure is proportional to the mismatch in the length of the coding sequences between the two strands.
[[File:Chargraff-2nd-6-mers.png|thumb|left|Chargaff's 2nd parity rule for prokaryotic 6-mers]]
The origin of the deviation from Chargaff's rule in the organelles has been suggested to be a consequence of the mechanism of replication.&lt;ref name=Nikolaou2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2006.06.010 |vauthors=Nikolaou C, Almirantis Y |year=2006 |title=Deviations from Chargaff's second parity rule in organellar DNA. Insights into the evolution of organellar genomes |journal=Gene |volume=381 |pages=34–41 |pmid=16893615}}&lt;/ref&gt; During replication the DNA strands separate. In single stranded DNA, [[cytosine]] spontaneously slowly deaminates to [[adenosine]] (a C to A [[transversion]]). The longer the strands are separated the greater the quantity of deamination. For reasons that are not yet clear the strands tend to exist longer in single form in mitochondria than in chromosomal DNA. This process tends to yield one strand that is enriched in [[guanine]] (G) and [[thymine]] (T) with its complement enriched in cytosine (C) and adenosine (A), and this process may have given rise to the deviations found in the mitochondria. {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence as there are faults in the judgement|date=January 2013}}{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}

Chargaff's second rule appears to be the consequence of a more complex parity rule: within a single strand of DNA any oligonucleotide ([[k-mer]] or [[n-gram]]; length ≤ 10) is present in equal numbers to its reverse complementary nucleotide. Because of the computational requirements this has not been verified in all genomes for all oligonucleotides. It has been verified for triplet oligonucleotides for a large data set.&lt;ref name="Albrecht-Buehler2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0605553103 |author=Albrecht-Buehler G |year=2006 |title=Asymptotically increasing compliance of genomes with Chargaff's second parity rules through inversions and inverted transpositions |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=103 |issue=47 |pages=17828–17833 |pmid=17093051 |pmc=1635160|bibcode=2006PNAS..10317828A |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albrecht-Buehler has suggested that this rule is the consequence of genomes evolving by a process of [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion]] and [[Transposon|transposition]].&lt;ref name="Albrecht-Buehler2006"/&gt; This process does not appear to have acted on the mitochondrial genomes. Chargaff's second parity rule appears to be extended from the nucleotide-level to populations of codon triplets, in the case of whole single-stranded Human genome DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Perez, J.-C. |title= Codon populations in single-stranded whole human genome DNA are fractal and fine-tuned by the Golden Ratio 1.618 |journal= Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences |date=September 2010 |volume= 2 |issue= 3 |pages= 228–240 |pmid= 20658335 |doi= 10.1007/s12539-010-0022-0 |s2cid= 54565279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A kind of "codon-level second Chargaff's parity rule" is proposed as follows:

In 2020, it is suggested that the physical properties of the dsDNA (double stranded DNA) and the tendency to maximum entropy of all the physical systems are the cause of Chargaff's second parity rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Piero Farisell, Cristian Taccioli, Luca Pagani &amp; Amos Maritan |title= DNA sequence symmetries from randomness: the origin of the Chargaff's second parity rule |journal= Briefings in Bioinformatics |date=April 2020 |volume= 22 |issue= bbaa04 |pages= 2172–2181 |pmid= 32266404 |doi= 10.1093/bib/bbaa041 |pmc= 7986665 |doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symmetries and patterns present in the dsDNA sequences can emerge from the physical peculiarities of the dsDNA molecule and the maximum entropy principle alone, rather than from biological or environmental evolutionary pressure.

{{other uses|cheating (disambiguation)}}
'''Cheating''' is a term used in [[behavioral ecology]] and [[ethology]] to describe behavior whereby organisms receive a benefit at the cost of other organisms. Cheating is common in many mutualistic and altruistic relationships.&lt;ref name="Bronstein2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ferriere, R.|author2=Bronstein, J.L.|author3=Rinaldi, S.|author4=Law, R.|author5=Gauduchon, M.|title=Cheating and the evolutionary stability of mutualisms|journal=Proc.

R.|author2= Kokko, H.|title=Cheating can stabilize cooperation in mutualisms|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2006|volume=273|issue=1598|pages=2233–2239|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3571|pmid=16901844|pmc=1635526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical models ==

Organisms communicate and cooperate to perform a wide range of behaviors. [[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]], or mutually beneficial interactions between species, is common in ecological systems.&lt;ref name="Bronstein"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Bronstein, J. L.|title= The exploitation of mutualisms|journal= Ecology Letters|date=2001|volume=4|issue=3|pages=277–287|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2001.00218.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions can be thought of "biological markets" in which species offer partners goods that are relatively inexpensive for them to produce and receive goods that are more expensive or even impossible for them to produce.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Schwartz, M. W.|author2= Hoeksema, J. D|title= Specialization and resource trade: biological markets as a model of mutualisms|journal= Ecology|date=1998|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1029–1038|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1029:sartbm]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these systems provide opportunities for exploitation by individuals that can obtain resources while providing nothing in return. Exploiters can take on several forms: individuals outside a mutualistic relationship who obtain a commodity in a way that confers no benefit to either mutualist, individuals who receive benefits from a partner but have lost the ability to give any in return, or individuals who have the option of behaving mutualistically towards their partners but chose not to do so.&lt;ref name="Bronstein" /&gt;

Cheaters, who do not cooperate but benefit from others who do cooperate gain a competitive edge. In an evolutionary context, this competitive edge refers to a greater ability to survive or to reproduce. If individuals who cheat are able to gain survivorship and reproductive benefits while incurring no costs, natural selection should favor cheaters. However, mechanisms also exist that prevent cheaters from undermining mutualistic systems. One main factor is that the advantages of cheating are often frequency-dependent. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] occurs when the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of a phenotype depends on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a population. Cheater phenotypes often display negative frequency-dependent selection, where fitness increases as a phenotype becomes less common and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Riechert2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Pruitt, J. N.|title=Frequency-Dependent Success of Cheaters During Foraging Bouts Might Limit Their Spread within Colonies of a Socially Polymorphic Spider|author2=Riechert, S. E.|author2-link= Susan Riechert |journal=Evolution|date=2009|volume=63|issue=11|pages=2966–2973|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00771.x|pmid=19619222|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cheaters do best (in terms of evolutionary benefits such as increased survival and reproduction) when there are relatively few of them, but as cheaters become more abundant, they do worse.

For example, in ''Escherichia coli'' colonies, there are antibiotic-sensitive "cheaters" that persist at low numbers on antibiotic-laced mediums when in a cooperative colony. These cheaters enjoy the benefit of others producing antibiotic-resistant agents while producing none themselves. However, as numbers increase, if they persist in not producing the antibiotic agent themselves, they are more likely to be negatively impacted by the antibiotic substrate because there is less antibiotic agent to protect everyone.&lt;ref name="Riechert2009" /&gt; Thus, cheaters can persist in a population because their exploitative behavior gives them an advantage when they exist at low frequencies but these benefits are diminished when they are greater in number.

Others have proposed that cheating (exploitive behavior) can stabilize cooperation in mutualistic systems.&lt;ref name="Kokko" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Little2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Little, A. E.|author2= Currie, C. R.|title= Parasites may help stabilize cooperative relationships|journal= BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=124|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-9-124|pmid=19486536|pmc=2701933}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many mutualistic systems, there will be feedback benefits to those that cooperate. For instance, the fitness of both partners may be improved. If there is a high reward or many benefits for the individual that initiated the cooperative behavior, mutualism should be selected for. When researchers investigated the co-evolution of cooperation and choice in a choosy host and its symbiont (an organism that lives in a relationship that benefits all parties involved), their model indicated that although choice and cooperation may be initially selected for, this would often be unstable.&lt;ref name="Kokko" /&gt; In other words, one cooperative partner will choose another cooperative partner if given a choice. However, if this choice is made over and over, variation is removed and this selection can no longer be maintained. This situation is similar to the [[lek mating|lek paradox]] in female choice. For example, in lek paradox, if females consistently choose for a particular male trait, genetic variance for that trait should eventually be eliminated, removing the benefits of choice. However, that choice somehow still persists.

One theory states that cheating maintains genetic variation in the face of selection for mutualism. One study shows that a small influx of immigrants with a tendency to cooperate less can generate enough genetic variability to stabilize selection for mutualism.&lt;ref name="Kokko" /&gt; This suggests that the presence of exploitive individuals, otherwise known as cheaters, contribute enough genetic variation to maintain mutualism itself. Both this theory and the negative frequency-dependent theory suggest that that cheating exists as part of a stable mixed evolutionary strategy with mutualism. In other words, cheating is a stable strategy used by individuals in a population where many other individuals cooperate. Another study supports that cheating can exist as a mixed strategy with mutualism using a mathematical game model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Számadó, S.|s2cid= 37319983|title= Cheating as a mixed strategy in a simple model of aggressive communication|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2000|volume=59|issue=1|pages=221–230|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1293|pmid= 10640384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, cheating can arise and be maintained in mutualistic populations.

Studies of cheating and dishonest communication in populations presupposes an organismal system that cooperates. Without a collective population that has signaling and interactions among individuals, behaviors such as cheating do not manifest. In other words, in order to study cheating behavior, a model system that engages in [[cooperation]] is needed. Models that provide insight on cheating include the social amoeba ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'';&lt;ref name="Strassmann2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Strassmann, J. E.|author2=Y.

===In ''Dictyostelium discoideum''===

''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' is a widely used model for cooperation and the development of [[multicellular organism|multicellularity]]. This species of amoeba are most commonly found in a [[ploidy|haploid]], single-celled state that feed independently and undergo [[asexual reproduction]]. However, when the scarcity of food sources cause individual cells to starve, roughly 10⁴ to 10⁵ cells aggregate to form a mobile, multicellular structure dubbed a "slug".&lt;ref name="Strassmann2000" /&gt; In the wild, aggregates generally contain multiple genotypes, resulting in chimeric mixtures. Unlike clonal (genetically identical) aggregates typically found in multicellular organisms, the potential for competition exists in chimeric aggregates.&lt;ref name="Strassmann2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Santorelli2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li2011" /&gt; For example, because individuals in the aggregate contain different genomes, differences in fitness can result in conflict of interest among cells in the aggregate, where different genotypes could potentially compete against each other for resources and reproduction.&lt;ref name="Strassmann2000" /&gt; In ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', roughly 20% of the cells in the aggregate become dead to make the stalk of a [[sorocarp|fruiting body]]. The remaining 80% of cells become spores in the sorus of the fruiting body, which can germinate again once conditions are more favorable.&lt;ref name="Strassmann2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Santorelli2008" /&gt; In this case, 20% of the cells must give up reproduction so that fruiting body forms successfully. This makes chimeric aggregates of ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' susceptible to cheating individuals that take advantage of the reproductive behavior without paying the fair price. In other words, if certain individuals tend to become a part of the sorus more frequently, they can gain increased benefit from the fruiting body system without sacrificing their own opportunities to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Strassmann2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Santorelli2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li2011" /&gt; Cheating behavior in ''D. discoideum'' is well established, and many studies have attempted to elucidate the evolutionary and genetic mechanisms underlying the behavior. Having a 34Mb genome that is completely sequenced and well annotated makes ''D. discoideum'' a useful model in studying the genetic bases and molecular mechanisms of cheating, and in a broader sense, [[evolution of eusociality|social evolution]].&lt;ref name="Li2011" /&gt;

===In eusocial insects===

Eusocial insects also serve as valuable tools in studying cheating. Eusocial insects behave cooperatively, where members of the community forgo reproduction to assist a few individuals to reproduce. Such model systems have potential for conflict of interest to arise among individuals, and thus also have potential for cheating to occur.&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2004a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cheney, K.L.|author2=Cote, I.M.|title=Mutualism or parasitism? The variable outcome of cleaning symbioses.|journal= Biol Lett |date=2005|volume=1|issue=2|pages=162–5|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0288|pmid=17148155|pmc=1626222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eusocial insects in the order Hymenoptera, which includes bees and wasps, exhibit good examples of conflicts of interest present in insect societies. In these systems, queen bees and wasps can mate and lay fertilized eggs that hatch into females. On the other hand, workers of most species in Hymenoptera can produce eggs, but cannot produce fertilized eggs due to loss of mating ability.&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2004a" /&gt; Workers that lay eggs represent a cost for the colony because workers that lay eggs often do significantly less work, and thus negatively impact the health of the colony (for example: decreased amount of collected food, or less attention given to tending the queen's eggs). In this case, a conflict of interest arises between the workers and the colony. The workers should lay eggs in order to pass on their genes; however, as a colony, having only the queen reproduce leads to better productivity.&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2004a" /&gt; If workers sought to pass their own genes by laying eggs, foraging activities would diminish, leading to decreased resources for the entire colony. This, in turn, can cause a [[tragedy of the commons]],&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2004b"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wenseleers, T.|author2=Ratnieks, F.L.W.|title=Tragedy of the commons in Melipona bees|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |date=2004|volume=271|issue=Suppl 5|pages=S310-2|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0159|pmid=15504003|pmc=1810046}}&lt;/ref&gt; where selfish behavior lead to the depletion of resources, with long-term negative consequences for the group. However, in natural bee and wasp societies, only 0.01–0.1% and 1%, respectively, of the workers lay eggs, suggesting that strategies exist to combat cheating to prevent tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2004a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2004b" /&gt; These insect systems have given scientists opportunities to study strategies that keep cheating in check. Such strategies are commonly referred to as "policing" strategies, generally where additional costs are imposed on cheaters to discourage or eliminate cheating behaviors. For example, honeybees and wasps may eat eggs produced by workers. In some ant species and yellowjackets, policing may occur via aggression towards or killing egg-laying individuals to minimize cheating.&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2004a" /&gt;

[[File:Cleaning station konan.jpg|thumbnail|Fish cleaned by smaller cleaner wrasses on Hawaiian reefs]]

===In cleaning symbiosis===

[[Cleaning symbiosis]] that develop between small and larger marine organisms often represent models useful for studying the evolution of stable social interactions and cheating. In the cleaning fish ''Labroides dimidiatus'' ([[Bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]), as in many cleaner species, client fish seeks to have [[parasitism|ectoparasites]] removed by the cleaners. In these situations, instead of picking off the parasites on the surface of the client fish, the cleaner can cheat by feeding on the client's tissue (mucus layer, scales, etc.), thereby gaining additional benefit from the symbiotic system.&lt;ref name="Bshary2002"/&gt; It has been well documented that cleaners will feed on mucus when their clients are unable to control the cleaner's behavior; however, in natural settings, client fish often jolt, chase after cheating cleaners, or terminate interactions of swimming way, effectively controlling the cheating behavior.&lt;ref name="Bshary2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapuis2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney2005" /&gt; Studies on cleaning mutualisms generally suggest that cheating behavior is often adjusted depending on the species of the client. In cleaning shrimp, cheating is predicted to occur less often because shrimps bear a higher cost if the clients use aggression to control the cleaner's behavior.&lt;ref name="Chapuis2009" /&gt; Studies have found that cleaner species can strategically adjust cheating behavior according to the potential associated risk. For example, predatory clients, which present a significantly high cost for cheating, experience less cheating behavior. On the other hand, nonpredatory clients present a lower cost for cheating, and thus experience more cheating behaviors from the cleaners.&lt;ref name="Chapuis2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney2005" /&gt; Some evidence suggest that physiological processes can mediate the cleaners' decision to switch from cooperating to cheating in mutualistic interactions. For example, in the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, changes in [[cortisol]] levels are associated with behavior changes.&lt;ref name="Soares2014" /&gt; For smaller clients, increase cortisol levels in the water lead to more cooperative behavior, while for larger clients, the same treatment lead to more dishonest behavior. It has been suggested that "good behavior" toward smaller clients often allow wrasses to attract larger clients that are often cheated.&lt;ref name="Soares2014" /&gt;

===Other===
Other models of cheating include the [[European tree frog]], "Hyla arborea". In many sexually reproducing species such as this, some males can access mates by exploiting resources of more competitive males.&lt;ref name="Brepson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brepson, L.|author2= Troïanowski, M.|author3=Voituron, Y.|author4=Lengagne, T.
|title=Cheating for sex: inherent disadvantage or energetic constraint?|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |date=2004|volume=84|issue=5|pages=1253–1260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species have dynamic reproductive strategies that can change in response to changes in the environment. In these instances, several factors contribute to the decision to switch between mating strategies. For example, in the European tree frog, a sexually competitive (as in, perceived to be attractive by females) male tend to call to attract mates. This is often referred to as the "bourgeois" tactic.&lt;ref name="Brepson2012" /&gt; On the other hand, a smaller male that would likely fail to attract mates using the bourgeois tactic will tend to hide near attractive males and attempt to access females. In this instance, the males can gain access to females without having to defend territories or acquiring additional resources (which often serve as the basis for attractiveness). This is referred to as the "parasitic" tactic, where the smaller male effectively cheats its way to accessing females, by reaping the benefit of sexual reproduction without contributing resources that normally attract females.&lt;ref name="Brepson2012" /&gt; Models such as this provide valuable tools for research aimed at energetic constraints and [[sensory cue|environmental cues]] involved in cheating. Studies find that mating strategies are highly adaptable and depend on a variety of factors, such as competitiveness, energetic costs involved in defending territory or acquiring resources.&lt;ref name="Brepson2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Castellano, S.|author2= Marconi, V.|author3= Zanollo, V.|author4= Berto, G.|title= Alternative mating tactics in the Italian treefrog, Hyla intermedia|journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=2009|volume=63|issue=8|pages=1109–1118|doi=10.1007/s00265-009-0756-z|s2cid= 35783869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Wells, K.|title= The energetics of calling in frogs|journal=Anuran Communication |date=2001| pages=45–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constraints and countermeasures ==

=== Environmental conditions and social interactions affecting microbial cheating ===
Like many other organisms, bacteria rely on iron intake for its biological processes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  However, iron is sometimes difficult to access in certain environments, like soil. Some bacteria have evolved [[siderophore]]s, iron-chelating particles that seek and bring back iron for the bacteria. Siderophores are not necessarily specific to its producer - sometimes another individual could take up the particles instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Galet|first1=Justine|last2=Deveau|first2=Aurélie|last3=Hôtel|first3=Laurence|last4=Frey-Klett|first4=Pascale|last5=Leblond|first5=Pierre|last6=Aigle|first6=Bertrand|date=2015-05-01|title=Pseudomonas fluorescens Pirates both Ferrioxamine and Ferricoelichelin Siderophores from Streptomyces ambofaciens|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=81|issue=9|pages=3132–3141|doi=10.1128/AEM.03520-14|issn=0099-2240|pmc=4393426|pmid=25724953}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' is a bacterium commonly found in the soil. Under low-iron conditions, ''P. fluorescens'' produces siderophores, specifically [[pyoverdine]], to retrieve the iron necessary for survival. However, when iron is readily available, either from freely diffusing in environment or another bacterium's siderophores, ''P. fluorescens'' ceases production, allowing the bacterium to devote its energy towards growth. One study showed that when ''P. fluorescens'' grew in association with ''[[Streptomyces ambofaciens]]'', another bacterium that produces the siderophore coelichen, no pyoverdine was detected. This result suggested that ''P. fluorescens'' ceased siderophore production in favor of taking up iron-bound coelichen, an association also known as siderophore piracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

More studies, however, suggested that ''P. fluorescens''' cheating behavior could be suppressed. In another study, two strains of ''P. fluorescens'' were studied in the soil, their natural environment. One strain, known as the producer, produced a higher level of siderophores, which meant that other strain, known as the non-producer, ceased siderophore production in favor of using the other's siderophores. Although one would expect that the non-producer would outcompete the producer, like the ''P. fluorescens'' and ''S. ambofaciens'' association, the study demonstrated that the non-producer was unable to do so in soil conditions, suggesting that the two strains could coexist. Further experiments suggested that this cheating prevention may be due to interactions with other microbes in the soil influencing the relationship or the spatial structure of the soil preventing siderophore diffusion and therefore limiting the non-producer's ability to exploit the producer's siderophores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Luján|first1=Adela M.|last2=Gómez|first2=Pedro|last3=Buckling|first3=Angus|date=2015-02-01|title=Siderophore cooperation of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in soil|journal=Biology Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=20140934|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2014.0934|issn=1744-9561|pmc=4360104|pmid=25694506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection pressure in bacteria (intraspecies) ===

By definition, individuals cheat to gain benefits that their non-cheating counterparts do not receive. This raises the question of how a cooperative system can exist in face of these cheaters. One answer is that the cheaters actually have a reduced fitness compared to the non-cheaters.
   
In a study by Dandekar et al., the researchers examined the survival rates of cheating and non-cheating bacteria populations (''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'') under varying environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Dandekar2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dandekar, A.A.|author2=Chugani, S.|author3=Greenberg, E.P.|title=Bacterial quorum sensing and metabolic incentives to cooperate|journal= Science |date=2012|volume=338|issue=6104|pages=264–266|doi=10.1126/science.1227289|bibcode = 2012Sci...338..264D|pmid=23066081|pmc=3587168}}&lt;/ref&gt; These microorganisms, like many species of bacteria, use a cell-cell communication system called [[quorum sensing]] that detect their population density and prompt the transcription of various resources when needed. In this case, the resources are publicly shared proteases that break down a food source like casein, and privately used adenosine hydrolase, which breaks down another food source, adenosine. The problem arises when some individuals ("cheaters") do not respond to these quorum sensing signals and therefore do not contribute to the costly protease production yet enjoy the benefits of the broken down resources.

When ''P. aeruginosa'' populations are placed into growth conditions where cooperation (and responding to the quorum signal) is costly, the number of cheaters increases, and the public resources are depleted, which can lead to a [[tragedy of the commons]]. However, when ''P. aeruginosa'' populations are placed into growth conditions with a proportion of adenosine, the cheaters are suppressed because the bacteria that responds to the quorum signal now produces adenosine hydrolase that they privately use for themselves to digest adenosine food source. In wild populations where the presence of adenosine is common, this is an explanation for how individuals that cooperate could have higher fitness than those that cheat, thereby suppressing the cheaters and maintaining cooperation.

=== Policing/punishment in insects ===
{{Further|Worker policing}}
Cheating is also commonly found in insects. The social and seemingly altruistic communities found in insects such as ants and bees provide ample opportunities for cheaters to take advantage of the system and accrue additional benefits at the expense of the community.

[[File:Wasp nest 3.jpg|thumbnail|Wasp nest, with some larvae]]

Sometimes, a colony of insects is called a "[[superorganism]]" for its ability to take on properties greater than those of the sum of individuals. A colony of insects in which different individuals are specialized for specific tasks means a greater colony production and greater efficiency.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Ratnieks, F.L.|author2=Foster, K.R.|author3=Wenseleers, T.|title= Conflict resolution in insect societies|journal= Annu. Rev. Entomol. |date=2006|volume=51|issue=51|pages=581–608|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.151003|pmid=16332224|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/69680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, based on the [[kin selection|kin-selection theory]], it is collectively beneficial for all the individuals in the community to have the queen to lay eggs rather than the workers lay eggs.&lt;ref name="Beekman2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Beekman, M.|author2= Oldroyd, B. P.|title= When workers disunite: intraspecific parasitism by eusocial bees|journal= Annu. Rev. Entomol.|date=2008|volume= 53|issue=53|pages=19–37|doi= 10.1146/annurev.ento.53.103106.093515|pmid= 17600462}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because if the workers lay eggs, it benefits the egg-laying worker individually, but the rest of the workers are now twice removed from this worker's offspring. Therefore, though it is beneficial for one individual to have its own offspring, it is collectively beneficial to have the queen lay the eggs. Therefore, a system of worker and queen policing exists against worker-laid eggs.

One form of policing occurs by the oophagy of the worker-laid eggs, found in many ant and bee species.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks2006" /&gt; This could be done by both or either the queen or the workers. In a series of experiments with honeybees (''[[Western honey bee|Apis mellifera]]''), Ratneiks &amp; Visscher found that other workers effectively removed worker-laid eggs in all colonies, whether the eggs were from originated from the same colonies or not.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks1989"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ratnieks, F.L.|author2=Visscher, P.K.|title=Worker policing in the honeybee|journal=Nature|date=1989|volume=342|issue=6251|pages=796–797|doi=10.1038/342796a0|bibcode=1989Natur.342..796R|s2cid=4366903}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a combination of queen and worker policing is found in ants, in the genus ''[[Diacamma]]'', in which worker-laid eggs are taken by other workers and fed to the "queen".&lt;ref name="Kikuta1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Kikuta, N.|author2=Tsuji, K.|title=Queen and worker policing in the monogynous and monandrous ant, Diacamma sp|journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1999|volume=46|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1007/s002650050608|s2cid=43077376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, these signals that identify the eggs as queen-laid are likely incorruptible, since it must be an honest signal to be maintained and not be used by cheating workers.&lt;ref name="Beekman2008" /&gt;

The other form of policing occurs through aggression towards egg-laying workers. In a species of tree wasp ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris]]'', Wenseleers et al. found that a combination of aggressive behavior and destruction of worker-laid eggs kept the number of worker-laid eggs low.&lt;ref name="Wenseleers2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Wenseleers, T.|author2= Tofilski, A.|author3= Ratnieks, F. L.|title=Queen and worker policing in the tree wasp Dolichovespula sylvestris|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=2005|volume=58|issue=1|pages=80–86|doi=10.1007/s00265-004-0892-4|s2cid= 16813247|url= https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/91817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, 91% of the worker-laid eggs were policed within one day. They also found that about 20% of workers laying eggs were prevented from doing so through both the queen's and workers' aggressive behavior. The workers and the queen would grab the egg-laying worker and try to sting her or push her off the cell. This usually results in the worker removing her abdomen and not depositing her eggs.

=== Policing/punishment in other organisms ===

[[File:Nest of naked mole rats.jpg|thumbnail|A nest of naked mole rats]]

Aggression and punishment are not just found in insects. For example, in [[naked mole-rat|naked mole rats]], punishments by the queen are a way she motivates the lazier, less-related workers in their groups.&lt;ref name="Reeve1992"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Reeve, H.K.|title=Queen activation of lazy workers in colonies of the eusocial naked mole-rat|journal=Nature|date=1992|volume=358|issue=6382|pages=147–9|doi=10.1038/358147a0|pmid=1614546|s2cid=4321146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The queen would shove the lazier workers, with the number of shoves increasing when there are fewer active workers. Reeve found that if the queen is removed when colonies are satiated, there is a significant drop in weight of the active workers because the lazier workers are taking advantage of the system.

Punishment is also a method used by cichlid ''[[Neolamprologous pulcher]]'' in their cooperative breeding systems. It is a pay-to-stay system where helper fish are allowed to stay in certain territories in exchange for their help.&lt;ref name="Fischer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fischer, S.|author2= Zöttl, M.|author3= Groenewoud, F.|title= Group-size-dependent punishment of idle subordinates in a cooperative breeder where helpers pay to stay|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2014|volume=281|issue=1789|page=20140184|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0184|pmid=24990673|pmc=4100499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the naked mole rats, the helpers that were prevented from helping, the "idle helpers", receive more aggression than control helpers in the study. Researchers theorize that this system developed because the fish are usually not closely related (so kinship benefits have little impact), and because there is a high level of predation risk when the fish is outside the group (therefore a strong motivator for the helper fish to stay in the group).&lt;ref name="Fischer2014" /&gt;

[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus monkeys]] also use aggression as a punishment. These animals have five distinct calls that they can "decide" to produce upon finding food. Whether they call or not is related to their [[sex]] and number of kin: females call more often and females with more kin call more often. However, sometimes when food is found, the individual ("discoverer") does not call to attract its kin and, presumably, to share food. If lower ranked individuals find this discoverer to be in the food drop area of the experiment, they recruit coalition support against this individual by screaming. The formed coalition then chases this individual away. If higher ranked individuals find this discoverer, they either chase the discoverer away or became physically aggressive towards the individual.&lt;ref name="Hauser1992"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hauser, M.D.|title=Costs of deception: cheaters are punished in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1992|volume=89|issue=24|pages=12137–12139|doi=10.1073/pnas.89.24.12137|pmid=1465451|bibcode = 1992PNAS...8912137H |pmc=50713|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results show that aggression as punishment is a way to encourage members to work together and share food when it is found.

=== Interspecific countermeasures ===

Cheating and constraints of cheating are not limited to intraspecific interactions; it can also occur in a mutualistic relationship between two species. A common example is the mutualistic relationship between cleaner fish ''[[Bluestreak cleaner wrasse|Labroides dimidiatus]]'' and reef fish. Bshary and Grutter found that cleaner wrasse prefers the client tissue mucus over ectoparasites.&lt;ref name="Bshary2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bshary, R.|author2=Grutter, A.S.|title= Punishment and partner switching cause cooperative behaviour in a cleaning mutualism|journal= Biology Letters |date=2005|volume=1|issue=4|pages=396–399|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0344|pmid=17148216|pmc=1626376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a conflict between the cleaner fish and reef fish, because the reef fish only benefit when the cleaner fish eats the ectoparasites. Further studies revealed that in a lab setting, the cleaner fish undergoes behavioral change in face of deterrents against eating their preferential food.&lt;ref name="Bshary2005" /&gt; In several trials, the plate of their preferential food source was immediately removed when they eat it, to mimic "client fleeing" in natural settings. In other trials, the plate of their preferential food source chased the cleaner fish when they eat it, mimicking "client chasing" in natural setting. After only six learning trials, the cleaners learned to choose against their preference, indicating that punishment is potentially a very effective countermeasure against cheating in mutualistic relationships.

[[File:Nitrogen-fixing nodules in the roots of legumes..JPG|thumbnail|Nitrogen-fixing nodules in legumes]]

Finally the countermeasures are not limited to organismal relationships. West et al. found a similar countermeasure against cheating in legume-rhizobium mutualism.&lt;ref name="West2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= West, S. A.|author2= Kiers, E.T.|author3=Pen, I.|author4=Denison, R.F.|title= Sanctions and mutualism stability: when should less beneficial mutualists be tolerated?|journal= Journal of Evolutionary Biology|date=2002|volume=15|issue=5|pages=830–837|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00441.x|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this relationship, nitrogen fixing bacteria [[Rhizobia|rhizobium]] fixes atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from inside the roots of leguminous plants, providing this essential source of nitrogen to these plants while also receiving organic acids for themselves.  However, some bacteria are more mutualistic, while others are more parasitic because they consume the plant's resources but fixes little to no N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, these plants cannot tell whether the bacteria are more or less parasitic until they are settled in the plant nodules. To prevent cheating, these plants seem to be able to punish the rhizobium bacteria. In a series of experiments, researchers forced non-cooperation between the bacteria and the plants by placing various nodules in nitrogen-free atmosphere. They saw a decrease in the rhizobium reproductive success by 50%.&lt;ref name="Kiers2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Kiers, E. T.|author2=Rousseau, R. A|author3= West, S. A.|author4=Denison, R. F.|title= Host sanctions and the legume–rhizobium mutualism|journal= Nature|date=2003|volume=425|issue=6953|pages=78–81|doi=10.1038/nature01931|pmid=12955144|bibcode = 2003Natur.425...78K |hdl=1842/469|s2cid=4363192|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; West et al. created a model for legume sanctioning the bacteria and hypothesizes that these behaviors exist to stabilize mutualistic interactions.&lt;ref name="West2002" /&gt;

Another well-known example of plant-organism interaction occurs between [[yucca]]s and [[Prodoxidae|yucca moths]]. The female yucca moths deposit their eggs one at a time to the yucca flower. At the same time, she also deposits a small amount of pollen from yucca flowers as nutrition for the yucca moths. Because most of the pollen is not consumed by the larva, yucca moths are therefore also the active pollinators for the yucca plant. Moreover, sometimes the female moths do not successfully deposit their eggs the first time, and may try again and again. The yucca plant receives scars from the multiple attempts, but they also receive more pollen, since the moths are depositing pollen with every try.

"Cheating" sometimes happens when the yucca moth deposits too many eggs in one plant. In this case, the yucca plant has little to no benefits from this interaction. However, the plant has a unique way of constraining this behavior. While the constraint against cheating often occurs directly to the individual, in this case, the constraint occurs to the individual's offspring. The yucca plant can "abort" the moths by aborting the flowers. Pellmyr and Huth found that there is selective maturation for flowers that have low egg loads and high number of scars (and therefore a high amount of pollen).&lt;ref name="Pellmyr1994"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Pellmyr, O.|author2= Huth, C. J. |title=Evolutionary stability of mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths|journal= Nature|date=1994|volume=372|issue=6503|pages=257–260|doi=10.1038/372257a0|bibcode = 1994Natur.372..257P |s2cid= 4330563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, there is selection against the "cheaters" who try to use the yucca plant without providing the benefits of pollination.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}
'''Chemical biology''' is a scientific discipline spanning the fields of [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]. The discipline involves the application of chemical techniques, analysis, and often [[small molecule]]s produced through [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]], to the study and manipulation of biological systems. In contrast to [[biochemistry]], which involves the study of the chemistry of biomolecules and regulation of biochemical pathways within and between cells, chemical biology deals with chemistry ''applied to'' biology (synthesis of biomolecules, the simulation of biological systems, etc.).

==Introduction==
Some forms of chemical biology attempt to answer biological questions by studying biological systems at the chemical level.  In contrast to research using [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], or [[molecular biology]], where [[mutagenesis]] can provide a new version of the organism, cell, or biomolecule of interest, chemical biology probes systems ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' with [[small molecule]]s that have been designed for a specific purpose or identified on the basis of biochemical or cell-based screening (see [[chemical genetics]]).

Chemical biology is one of several [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] sciences that tend to differ from older, [[reductionist]] fields and whose goals are to achieve a description of scientific [[holism]]. Chemical biology has scientific, historical and philosophical roots in [[medicinal chemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[bioorganic chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[metabolic engineering]].

==Systems of interest==

===Enrichment techniques for proteomics===
Chemical biologists work to improve [[proteomics]] through the development of enrichment strategies, chemical affinity tags, and new probes. Samples for proteomics often contain many peptide sequences and the sequence of interest may be highly represented or of low abundance, which creates a barrier for their detection. Chemical biology methods can reduce sample complexity by selective enrichment using [[affinity chromatography]]. This involves targeting a peptide with a distinguishing feature like a [[biotin label]] or a [[post translational modification]].&lt;ref name="pmid19743430"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao Y, Jensen ON | title = Modification-specific proteomics: strategies for characterization of post-translational modifications using enrichment techniques | journal = Proteomics | volume = 9 | issue = 20 | pages = 4632–41 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19743430 | pmc = 2892724 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200900398  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods have been developed that include the use of antibodies, lectins to capture glycoproteins, and [[Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography|immobilized metal ions]] to capture phosphorylated peptides and enzyme substrates to capture select enzymes.

===Enzyme probes===
To investigate enzymatic activity as opposed to total protein, activity-based reagents have been developed to label the enzymatically active form of proteins (see [[Activity-based proteomics]]). For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to [[suicide inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = López-Otín C, Overall CM | title = Protease degradomics: A new challenge for proteomics | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 509–19 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12094217 | doi = 10.1038/nrm858 | s2cid = 7586786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting.&lt;ref name="pmid11182321"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adam GC, Cravatt BF, Sorensen EJ | title = Profiling the specific reactivity of the proteome with non-directed activity-based probes | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–95 |date=January 2001 | pmid = 11182321 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(00)90060-7 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enzyme activity can also be monitored through converted substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tureček F | title = Mass spectrometry in coupling with affinity capture-release and isotope-coded affinity tags for quantitative protein analysis | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11813306 | doi = 10.1002/jms.275 | bibcode = 2002JMSp...37....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of enzyme substrates is a problem of significant difficulty in proteomics and is vital to the understanding of signal transduction pathways in cells. A method that has been developed uses "analog-sensitive" kinases to label substrates using an unnatural ATP analog, facilitating visualization and identification through a unique handle.&lt;ref name="pmid18265343"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blethrow J, Zhang C, Shokat KM, Weiss EL | title = Design and use of analog-sensitive protein kinases | journal = Curr Protoc Mol Biol | volume = Chapter 18 | pages = 18.11.1–18.11.19 |date=May 2004 | pmid = 18265343 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb1811s66 | s2cid = 25869680 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycobiology===
While [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and proteins are all encoded at the genetic level, glycans (sugar polymers) are not encoded directly from the genome and fewer tools are available for their study. [[Glycobiology]] is therefore an area of active research for chemical biologists. For example, cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars to probe their function. [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Carolyn Bertozzi's]] research group has developed methods for site-specifically reacting molecules at the surface of cells via synthetic sugars.&lt;ref name="Saxon pp. 2007–2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Saxon | first=E. | title=Cell Surface Engineering by a Modified Staudinger Reaction | journal=Science | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) | volume=287 | issue=5460 | date=2000-03-17 | issn=0036-8075 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5460.2007 | pages=2007–2010| pmid=10720325 | bibcode=2000Sci...287.2007S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorial chemistry===
Chemical biologists used automated synthesis of diverse small molecule libraries in order to perform high-throughput analysis of biological processes. Such experiments may lead to discovery of small molecules with [[antibiotic]] or chemotherapeutic properties.  These [[combinatorial chemistry]] approaches are identical to those employed in the discipline of pharmacology.

===Employing biology===
Many research programs are also focused on employing natural biomolecules to perform biological tasks or to support a new chemical method. In this regard, chemical biology researchers have shown that DNA can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry, self-assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials, and RNA can be evolved ''in vitro'' to produce new catalytic function. Additionally, heterobifunctional (two-sided) synthetic small molecules such as dimerizers or [[Proteolysis targeting chimera|PROTACs]] bring two proteins together inside cells, which can synthetically induce important new biological functions such as targeted protein degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cermakova K, Hodges HC | title = Next-Generation Drugs and Probes for Chromatin Biology: From Targeted Protein Degradation to Phase Separation | journal = Molecules | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1958 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30082609 | pmc = 6102721 | doi = 10.3390/molecules23081958 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peptide synthesis===
Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue specific incorporation of "[[posttranslational modification]]s" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even [[ubiquitin|ubiquitination]]. These capabilities are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein.

In order to make protein-sized polypeptide chains via the small peptide fragments made by synthesis, chemical biologists use the process of [[native chemical ligation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawson PE, Muir TW, Clarklewis I, ((Kent SBH)) | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5186 | pages = 776–779 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7973629 | doi = 10.1126/science.7973629 |bibcode = 1994Sci...266..776D | title = Synthesis of proteins by native chemical ligation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Native chemical ligation involves the coupling of a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine residue, ultimately resulting in formation of a "native" amide bond. Other strategies that have been used for the ligation of peptide fragments using the acyl transfer chemistry first introduced with native chemical ligation include expressed protein ligation,&lt;ref name="pmid9618476"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muir TW, Sondhi D, Cole PA | title = Expressed protein ligation: a general method for protein engineering | journal = Proc.

USA | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6705–10 |date=June 1998 | pmid = 9618476 | pmc = 22605 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.95.12.6705|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6705M | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; sulfurization/desulfurization techniques,&lt;ref name="pmid16710874"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu B, Chen J, Warren JD, Chen G, Hua Z, Danishefsky SJ | title = Building complex glycopeptides: Development of a cysteine-free native chemical ligation protocol | journal = Angew.

Both sulfurization/desulfurization techniques and the use of removable thiol auxiliaries involve the installation of a synthetic thiol moiety to carry out the standard native chemical ligation chemistry, followed by removal of the auxiliary/thiol.

===Directed evolution===
A primary goal of [[protein engineering]] is the design of novel [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] with a desired structure and chemical activity. Because our knowledge of the relationship between primary sequence, structure, and function of proteins is limited, [[protein design|rational design]] of new proteins with engineered activities is extremely challenging. In [[directed evolution]], repeated cycles of genetic diversification followed by a screening or selection process, can be used to mimic [[natural selection]] in the laboratory to design new proteins with a desired activity.&lt;ref name="pmid18573077"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jäckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D | title = Protein design by directed evolution | journal = Annu Rev Biophys | volume = 37 | pages = 153–73 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18573077 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods exist for creating large libraries of sequence variants. Among the most widely used are subjecting [[DNA]] to [[UV radiation]] or [[mutagen|chemical mutagens]], [[PCR|error-prone PCR]], [[genetic code|degenerate codons]], or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].&lt;ref name="Bittker_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SV, Walter KU, Kast P, Hilvert D | title = Searching sequence space for protein catalysts | journal = Proc.

Common selection/screening techniques include [[fluorescence-activated cell sorting|FACS]],&lt;ref name="pmid15811807"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aharoni A, Griffiths AD, Tawfik DS | title = High-throughput screens and selections of enzyme-encoding genes | journal = Curr Opin Chem Biol | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–6 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 15811807 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2005.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mRNA display]],&lt;ref name="pmid11274392"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson DS, Keefe AD, Szostak JW | title = The use of mRNA display to select high-affinity protein-binding peptides | journal = Proc.

The development of directed evolution methods was honored in 2018 with the awarding of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] to [[Frances Arnold]] for evolution of enzymes, and [[George Smith (chemist)|George Smith]] and [[Gregory Winter]] for phage display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2018/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioorthogonal reactions===
Successful labeling of a molecule of interest requires specific functionalization of that molecule to react chemospecifically with an optical probe.  For a labeling experiment to be considered robust, that functionalization must minimally perturb the system.&lt;ref name="pmid19714693"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sletten EM, Bertozzi CR | title = Bioorthogonal chemistry: fishing for selectivity in a sea of functionality | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. | volume = 48 | issue = 38 | pages = 6974–98 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19714693 | pmc = 2864149 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200900942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, these requirements are often hard to meet.  Many of the reactions normally available to organic chemists in the laboratory are unavailable in living systems.  Water- and redox- sensitive reactions would not proceed, reagents prone to nucleophilic attack would offer no chemospecificity, and any reactions with large kinetic barriers would not find enough energy in the relatively low-heat environment of a living cell.
Thus, chemists have recently developed a panel of [[bioorthogonal chemistry]] that proceed chemospecifically, despite the milieu of distracting reactive materials ''in vivo''.

The coupling of an probe to a molecule of interest must occur within a reasonably short time frame; therefore, the kinetics of the coupling reaction should be highly favorable.  [[Click chemistry]] is well suited to fill this niche, since click reactions are rapid, spontaneous, selective, and high-yielding.&lt;ref name="pmid11433435"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolb HC, Finn MG, Sharpless KB | title = Click Chemistry: Diverse Chemical Function from a Few Good Reactions | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 2004–2021 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11433435 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20010601)40:11&lt;2004::AID-ANIE2004&gt;3.0.CO;2-5 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the most famous "click reaction," a [3+2] [[cycloaddition]] between an [[azide]] and an acyclic [[alkyne]], is copper-catalyzed, posing a serious problem for use ''in vivo'' due to copper's toxicity.&lt;ref name="pmid12203546"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rostovtsev VV, Green LG, Fokin VV, Sharpless KB | title = A stepwise huisgen cycloaddition process: copper(I)-catalyzed regioselective "ligation" of azides and terminal alkynes | journal = Angew.

To bypass the necessity for a catalyst, [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Carolyn R. Bertozzi's]] lab introduced inherent strain into the alkyne species by using a cyclic alkyne.  In particular, [[Cycloalkyne|cyclooctyne]] reacts with azido-molecules with distinctive vigor.&lt;ref name="pmid15547999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agard NJ, Prescher JA, Bertozzi CR | title = A strain-promoted [3 + 2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition for covalent modification of biomolecules in living systems | journal = J.

The most common method of installing bioorthogonal reactivity into a target biomolecule is through metabolic labeling.  Cells are immersed in a medium where access to nutrients is limited to synthetically modified analogues of standard fuels such as sugars.  As a consequence, these altered biomolecules are incorporated into the cells in the same manner as the unmodified metabolites.  A probe is then incorporated into the system to image the fate of the altered biomolecules.  Other methods of functionalization include enzymatically inserting [[azides]] into [[proteins]],&lt;ref name="pmid19345117"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hur GH, Meier JL, Baskin J, Codelli JA, Bertozzi CR, Marahiel MA, Burkart MD | title = Crosslinking studies of protein–protein interactions in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis | journal = Chem.

===Discovery of biomolecules through metagenomics===
The advances in modern sequencing technologies in the late 1990s allowed scientists to investigate DNA of communities of organisms in their natural environments ("eDNA"), without culturing individual species in the lab. This [[metagenomics|metagenomic]] approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition. Sources of eDNA include [[soils]], ocean, [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]], [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal vents]], [[polar ice caps]], hypersaline habitats, and extreme pH environments.&lt;ref name="pmid15040261"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keller M, Zengler K | title = Tapping into microbial diversity | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–50 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 15040261 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro819 | s2cid = 11512358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many applications of metagenomics, researchers such as [[Jo Handelsman]], [[Jon Clardy]], and [[Robert M.

[[File:Overview of metagenomic methods.jpg|thumb|370px|alt=Overview of metagenomic methods|Overview of metagenomic methods]]
[[Functional symptom|Functional]] or [[homology (biology)|homology]] screening strategies have been used to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules. Functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific [[phenotypes]] that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics. Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify [[conserved sequences]] that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Banik JJ, Brady SF | title = Recent application of metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of antimicrobials and other bioactive small molecules | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 603–609 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20884282 | pmc = 3111150 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2010.08.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Functional metagenomic studies enable the discovery of novel genes that encode biologically active molecules. These assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes, and pH assays that can screen for pH change due to newly synthesized molecules using pH indicator on an [[agar]] plate.&lt;ref name="Daniel_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Daniel R | title = The metagenomics of soil | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 470–478 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15931165 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1160 | s2cid = 32604394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds, has also been used to search for genes with specific functions.&lt;ref name = "Daniel_2005"/&gt; Homology-based metagenomic studies have led to a fast discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of biologically active molecules. As soon as the genes are sequenced, scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"/&gt; The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes.

===Kinases===
[[Posttranslational modification]] of proteins with [[phosphate]] groups by [[kinase]]s is a key regulatory step throughout all biological systems.  Phosphorylation events, either phosphorylation by protein kinases or dephosphorylation by [[phosphatases]], result in protein activation or deactivation.  These events have an impact on the regulation of physiological pathways, which makes the ability to dissect and study these pathways integral to understanding the details of cellular processes. There exist a number of challenges—namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome, the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques—that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrant MK, Cole PA | title = The Chemical Biology of Protein Phosphorylation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 78 | pages = 797–825 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19489734 | pmc = 3074175 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.78.070907.103047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the use of small molecule modulators of protein kinases, chemical biologists have gained a better understanding of the effects of protein phosphorylation. For example, nonselective and selective kinase inhibitors, such as a class of pyridinylimidazole compounds &lt;ref name="pmid9224565"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson KP, McCaffrey PG, Hsiao K, Pazhanisamy S, Galullo V, Bemis GW, Fitzgibbon MJ, Caron PR, Murcko MA, Su MS | title = The structural basis for the specificity of pyridinylimidazole inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 423–31 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224565 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(97)90194-0 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; are potent inhibitors useful in the dissection of [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAP kinase]] signaling pathways. These pyridinylimidazole compounds function by targeting the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] binding pocket.

Another class of compounds, mechanism-based inhibitors, combines  knowledge of the kinase enzymology with previously utilized inhibition motifs.

The development of novel chemical means of incorporating [[phosphomimetics|phosphomimetic]] amino acids into proteins has provided important insight into the effects of phosphorylation events.  Phosphorylation events have typically been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site ([[serine]], [[threonine]] or [[tyrosine]]) to an amino acid, such as [[alanine]], that cannot be phosphorylated. However, these techniques come with limitations and chemical biologists have developed improved ways of investigating protein phosphorylation. By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous [[phosphonate]] mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations. [[Expressed protein ligation]], has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either terminus.&lt;ref name="pmid9618476"/&gt; In addition, researchers have used [[Expanded genetic code|unnatural amino acid mutagenesis]] at targeted sites within a peptide sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noren CJ, Anthony-Cahill SJ, Griffith MC, Schultz PG | title = A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901 | pages = 182–188 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2649980 | doi = 10.1126/science.2649980 |bibcode = 1989Sci...244..182N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16689635"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L, Xie J, Schultz PG | title = Expanding the genetic code | journal = Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct | volume = 35 | pages = 225–49 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16689635 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.35.101105.121507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in chemical biology have also improved upon classical techniques of imaging kinase action.  For example, the development of [[peptide biosensors]]—peptides containing incorporated [[fluorophore]]s improved temporal resolution of in vitro binding assays.&lt;ref name="pmid17881302"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma V, Wang Q, Lawrence DS | title = Peptide-based fluorescent sensors of protein kinase activity: design and applications | journal = Biochim.

To utilize FRET for phosphorylation studies, fluorescent proteins are coupled to both a phosphoamino acid binding domain and a peptide that can by phosphorylated.  Upon phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a substrate peptide, a conformational change occurs that results in a change in fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Violin JD, Zhang J, Tsein RY, Newton AC | title = A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter reveals oscillatory phosphorylation by protein kinase C | journal = J.

===Biological fluorescence===
Chemical biologists often study the functions of biological macromolecules using [[fluorescence]] techniques. The advantage of fluorescence versus other techniques resides in its high sensitivity, non-invasiveness, safe detection, and ability to modulate the fluorescence signal. In recent years, the discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) by [[Roger Y. Tsien]] and others, hybrid systems and quantum dots have enabled assessing protein location and function more precisely.&lt;ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Giepmans BNG)), Adams SR, Ellisman MH, Tsien RY | s2cid = 1288600 | title = The Fluorescent Toolbox for Assessing Protein Location and Function | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5771 | pages = 217–224 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16614209 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124618 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..217G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of fluorophores are used: small organic dyes, green fluorescent proteins, and [[quantum dots]]. Small organic dyes usually are less than 1 kDa, and have been modified to increase photostability and brightness, and reduce self-quenching. Quantum dots have very sharp wavelengths, high molar absorptivity and quantum yield. Both organic dyes and quantum dyes do not have the ability to recognize the protein of interest without the aid of antibodies, hence they must use [[immunolabeling]]. Fluorescent proteins are genetically encoded and can be fused to your protein of interest. Another genetic tagging technique is the tetracysteine biarsenical system, which requires modification of the targeted sequence that includes four cysteines, which binds membrane-permeable biarsenical molecules, the green and the red dyes "FlAsH" and "ReAsH", with picomolar affinity. Both fluorescent proteins and biarsenical tetracysteine can be expressed in live cells, but present major limitations in ectopic expression and might cause a loss of function.

Fluorescent techniques have been used assess a number of protein dynamics including protein tracking, conformational changes, protein–protein interactions, protein synthesis and turnover, and enzyme activity, among others. Three general approaches for measuring protein net redistribution and diffusion are single-particle tracking, [[correlation spectroscopy]] and photomarking methods. In single-particle tracking, the individual molecule must be both bright and sparse enough to be tracked from one video to the other. Correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects into and out of a small volume at the focus of a laser. In photomarking, a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the marked molecule can be imaged directly. Michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single-particle tracking using biotin-quantum dots in HeLa cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalet X, Pinaud FF, Bentolila LA, Tsay JM, Doose S, Li JJ, Sundaresan G, Wu AM, Gambhir SS | title = Quantum Dots for Live Cells, in Vivo Imaging, and Diagnostics | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5709 | pages = 538–544 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15681376 | pmc = 1201471 | doi = 10.1126/science.1104274 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..538M }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to label the protein of interest with two fluorophores within close proximity. [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] will respond to internal conformational changes result from reorientation of one fluorophore with respect to the other. One can also use fluorescence to visualize enzyme activity, typically by using a quenched [[activity based proteomics]] (qABP). Covalent binding of a qABP to the active site of the targeted enzyme will provide direct evidence concerning if the enzyme is responsible for the signal upon release of the quencher and regain of fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Terai T, Nagano T | title = Fluorescent probes for bioimaging applications | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 515–21 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18771748 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="8017" xml:space="preserve">A '''chemically defined medium''' is a [[growth medium]] suitable for the [[in vitro]] [[cell culture]] of [[human cells|human]] or [[animal cells]] in which all of the chemical components are known. Standard cell culture media commonly consist of a basal medium supplemented with animal serum (such as fetal bovine serum, FBS) as a source of nutrients and other ill-defined factors. The technical disadvantages to using serum include its undefined nature, batch-to-batch variability in composition, and the risk of contamination.

There is a clear distinction between serum-based media and chemically defined media. Serum-based media may contain undefined animal-derived products such as serum (purified from blood), hydrolysates, growth factors, hormones, carrier proteins, and attachment factors. These undefined animal-derived products will contain complex contaminants, such as the lipid content of albumin. In contrast, chemically defined media require that all of the components must be identified and have their exact concentrations known. Therefore, a chemically defined medium must be entirely free of animal-derived components and cannot contain either [[fetal bovine serum]], [[bovine serum]] or [[human serum]]. To achieve this, chemically defined media is commonly supplemented with recombinant versions of albumin and growth factors, usually derived from rice or ''E. coli'', or synthetic chemical such as the polymer [[polyvinyl alcohol]] which can reproduce some of the functions of BSA/HSA.

The constituents of a chemically defined media include: a basal media (such as DMEM, F12, or RPMI 1640, containing amino acids, vitamins, inorganic salts, buffers, antioxidants and energy sources), which is supplemented with recombinant albumin, chemically defined lipids, recombinant [[insulin]] and/or zinc, recombinant [[transferrin]] or iron, [[selenium]] and an antioxidant [[thiol]] such as [[2-mercaptoethanol]] or [[1-thioglycerol]]. Chemically defined media that are designed for the cultivation of cells in suspension additionally contain suitable [[Surfactant|surfactants]] such as [[Poloxamer|poloxamers]] in order to reduce shear stress caused by shaking and stirring.

==The advantages of chemically defined media==

* Avoidance of batch to batch variation of bovine serum or albumin, which causes inconsistency in growth-promoting properties. 
* Low protein content, which can hinder product purification. 
* Elimination of the risk of contaminants—viruses, mycoplasma, prions from animal-derived products which may be transmitted to the end product used by humans, e.g., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. 
* Elimination of factors that may interfere with hormones or growth factors when studying their interaction with cells. 
* Removal of concerns regarding the limited availability of fetal bovine serum, with periods of world shortages. 
* Reduced cost: fetal calf serum can account for up to 85% of the overall cost of the medium when calculated for large-scale cultures.  
* There are increasing concerns about animal suffering inflicted during serum collection that add an ethical imperative to move away from the use of serum wherever possible.

Chemically defined media also allows researchers who are studying in the field of cell physiology (especially extracellular) and or molecule–cell interactions to eliminate any variables that may arise due to the effects of unknown components in the medium. 

==Classes of media==
Animal culture media can be divided into six subsets based on the level of defined media (Jayme and Smith, 2000): From lowest definition to highest these are:

* Serum-containing media (commonly 10-20% FBS)
* Reduced-serum media (commonly 1-5% FBS)
* Serum-free media (synonymous with Defined media) 
* Protein-free media (no protein but contains undefined peptides from plant hydrolysates)
* Chemically-defined media (with only recombinant proteins and/or hormones)
* Protein-free, chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents, but can contain synthetic peptides/hormones)
* Peptide-free, protein-free chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents)

==Misuse of the term chemically defined media==
The term chemically defined media is often misused in the literature to refer to serum albumin-containing media. The term 'defined media' can also be used to describe this type of media. Media formulations containing the media supplement B27 (supplied by [[Invitrogen]]) are often erroneously referred to as chemically defined media (e.g. Yao et al., 2006) despite this product containing bovine serum albumin (Chen et al., 2008) using the above definitions this type of media is referred to as serum-free media. Peptide-free, protein-free, chemically defined media are rarely successfully formulated except for [[Chinese hamster ovary cell|CHO]] and insect cells.

==Other variants of serum-free/defined media include==
Animal protein-free media, containing human serum albumin, human transferrin, but potentially animal-derived insulin and lipids.

Xeno-free media, containing human serum albumin, human transferrin, human insulin, and chemically defined lipids.

==History==
The first small molecule CID system was developed in 1993 and used [[FK1012]], a derivative of the drug [[tacrolimus]] (FK506), to induce homo-dimerization of [[FKBP]].&lt;ref name = "Fegan_2010" /&gt; This system was used ''in vivo'' to induce binding between cell surface receptors which could not bind in the normal way because they lacked the transmembrane and extracellular domain. Addition of FK1012 to the cells caused signal transduction.

==Applications==
CID has been used for a number of applications in biomedical research. In most applications each dimerizing protein is expressed as part of a fusion construct with other proteins of interest. Adding the chemical dimerizing agent brings both constructs into proximity with each other and induces interactions between the proteins of interest. CID has been used to regulate and monitor gene transcription, signal transduction and post translational modifications in proteins.

Recently, CID has also been used to create a basic component of [[biocomputers]], logic gates, from genetically manipulated cells.&lt;ref name = "Miyamoto_2012" /&gt; In this application, two independent CID systems, one based on plant proteins and one based on bacterial proteins are expressed in the same cell. Each set of proteins can be induced to dimerize by the addition of a separate chemical. By creating fusion proteins with the dimerizing proteins, membrane bound proteins and proteins that activate cell ruffling an [[AND gate]] and [[OR gate]] can be created that take chemical dimerizing agents as inputs and returns a ruffled or unruffled state as output.

      <text bytes="65156" xml:space="preserve">'''Chemoproteomics''' entails a broad array of techniques used to identify and interrogate [[protein]]-[[small molecule]] interactions. Chemoproteomics complements [[Classical pharmacology|phenotypic drug discovery]], a paradigm that aims to discover [[lead compound]]s on the basis of alleviating a disease [[phenotype]], as opposed to [[Reverse pharmacology|target-based drug discovery (reverse pharmacology)]], in which lead compounds are designed to interact with predetermined disease-driving [[biological target]]s.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conway LP, Li W, Parker CG | title = Chemoproteomic-enabled phenotypic screening | language = English | journal = Cell Chemical Biology | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–393 | date = March 2021 | pmid = 33577749 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2021.01.012 | s2cid = 231910437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As phenotypic drug discovery [[assay]]s do not provide confirmation of a compound's [[mechanism of action]], chemoproteomics provides valuable follow-up strategies to narrow down potential [[Biological target|targets]] and eventually validate a [[molecule]]'s [[mechanism of action]].&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Chemoproteomics also attempts to address the inherent challenge of [[polypharmacology|drug promiscuity]] in [[small molecule]] [[drug discovery]] by analyzing protein-small molecule interactions on a [[proteome]]-wide scale. A major goal of chemoproteomics is to characterize the [[interactome]] of [[drug candidate]]s to gain insight into mechanisms of [[off-target]] [[toxicity]] and [[polypharmacology]].&lt;ref name=":133"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moellering RE, Cravatt BF | title = How chemoproteomics can enable drug discovery and development | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–22 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22284350 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.01.001 | pmc=3312051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemoproteomics [[assay]]s can be stratified into three basic types. Solution-based approaches involve the use of drug analogs that chemically modify target proteins in [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]], tagging them for identification. Immobilization-based approaches seek to isolate potential [[Biological target|targets]] or [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] by anchoring their binding partners to an immobile support. [[Derivatization]]-free approaches aim to infer [[drug]]-[[Biological target|target]] interactions by observing changes in [[physicochemical properties|protein stability]] or drug [[chromatography]] upon binding. Computational techniques complement the chemoproteomic toolkit as parallel lines of evidence supporting potential [[drug]]-[[Biological target|target]] pairs, and are used to generate [[Molecular model|structural models]] that inform [[lead optimization]]. Several [[Biological target|targets]] of high profile [[drug]]s have been identified using chemoproteomics, and the continued improvement of [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] and [[chemical probe]] technology indicates that chemoproteomics will play a large role in future [[drug discovery]].

=== Context ===
[[File:Quantitative_Proteomics.png|thumb|414x414px|&lt;small&gt;'''An example quantitative proteomics workflow.''' Protein extracts from different samples are extracted and digested using [[trypsin]]. Separate samples are labeled using individual [[Tandem mass tag|isobaric tandem mass tags]] (TMTs), then labeled samples are pooled. The sample origin of each peptide can be discerned from the TMT attached to it. Labeled [[peptide]]s are then detected and [[Fragmentation (mass spectrometry)|fragmented]] by [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS/MS]], and quantified by comparing relative amounts of TMT fragments in each [[mass spectrum]].

The conclusion of [[Human Genome Project|the Human Genome Project]] was followed with hope for a new paradigm in treating disease. Many fatal and intractable diseases were able to be [[Gene mapping|mapped to specific genes]], providing a starting point to better understand the roles of their [[protein]] products in illness. [[Drug discovery]] has made use of animal [[Gene knockout|knock-out models]] that highlight the impact of a [[Protein|protein's]] absence, particularly in the development of disease, and [[Medicinal chemistry|medicinal chemists]] have leveraged [[computational chemistry]] to generate high [[Affinity (biochemistry)|affinity]] compounds against disease-causing proteins.&lt;ref name=":133" /&gt; Yet [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] [[drug approval]] rates have been on the decline over the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dowden H, Munro J | title = Trends in clinical success rates and therapeutic focus | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 495–496 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 31267067 | doi = 10.1038/d41573-019-00074-z | s2cid = 164564888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One potential source of drug failure is the disconnect between early and late [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref name=":133" /&gt; Early [[drug discovery]] focuses on [[Genetics|genetic]] validation of a target, which is a strong predictor of success, but [[Gene knockout|knock-out]] and [[overexpression]] systems are simplistic. Spatially and temporally [[Conditional gene knockout|conditional knock-out]]/[[Gene knock-in|knock-in]] systems have improved the level of nuance in ''in vivo'' analysis of [[protein]] function, but still fail to completely parallel the systemic breadth of pharmacological action.&lt;ref name=":133" /&gt; For example, drugs often act through multiple mechanisms, and often work best by [[Partial agonist|engaging targets partially]].&lt;ref name=":133" /&gt; Chemoproteomic tools offer a solution to bridge the gap between a [[Genetics|genetic]] understanding of disease and a [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] understanding of [[drug action]] by identifying the many proteins involved in therapeutic success.

=== Basic tools ===
The chemoproteomic toolkit is anchored by [[liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS/MS or LC-MS) based [[quantitative proteomics]], which allows for the near complete identification and relative quantification of complex [[proteome]]s in biological samples.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Tao WA, Zhang Y|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1159429237|title=Mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics|date=4 September 2019 |isbn=978-1-118-96955-7|oclc=1159429237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Proteomics|proteomic]] analysis, the detection of [[post-translational modification]]s, like [[phosphorylation]], [[glycosylation]], [[acetylation]], and recently [[ubiquitination]], which give insight into the functional state of a cell, is also possible.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; The vast majority of [[Proteomics|proteomic]] studies are analyzed using [[Resolution (mass spectrometry)|high-resolution]] [[orbitrap]] [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]] and samples are processed using a generalizable workflow. A standard procedure begins with sample [[lysis]], in which proteins are extracted into a [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] [[Buffer solution|buffer]] containing [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], an agent that [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduces]] [[disulfide bonds]], such as [[Dithiothreitol|diothiothreitol]], and an [[Alkylation|alkylating agent]] that caps [[thiol group]]s, such as [[iodoacetamide]]. [[Denatured protein]]s are [[Proteolysis|proteolysed]], often with [[trypsin]], and then separated from other mixture components prior to analysis via [[LC-MS/MS]]. For more accurate quantification, different samples can be reacted with [[Tandem mass tag|isobaric tandem mass tags]] (TMTs), a form of chemical barcode that allows for sample [[multiplexing]], and then pooled.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

A [[Covalent bond|covalent]] warhead and reporter tag are connected by a linker group. The warhead [[Covalent bond|covalently bonds]] with the [[active site]] of an [[enzyme]] and the reporter tag is used to enrich or detect the labeled [[protein]]. Fluorophosphonate-[[biotin]] is an example of an activity-based probe that targets [[serine hydrolase]]s. It is connected to a [[Biotinylation|biotinylated]] enrichment handle by an [[alkane]] chain.

Broad [[Proteomics|proteomic]] and [[Transcriptomics technologies|transcriptomic]] profiling has led to innumerable advances in the biomedical space, but the characterization of [[RNA expression|RNA]] and [[protein]] expression is limited in its ability to inform on the [[Protein function|functional characteristics of proteins]]. Given that [[Transcriptomics technologies|transcript]] and protein expression information leave gaps in knowledge surrounding the effects of [[post-translational modification]]s and [[Protein–protein interaction|protein-protein interactions]] on [[enzyme]] activity, and that enzyme activity varies across [[cell type]]s, disease states, and [[physiological condition]]s, specialized tools are required to profile enzyme activity across contexts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nomura DK, Dix MM, Cravatt BF | title = Activity-based protein profiling for biochemical pathway discovery in cancer | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 630–638 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20703252 |  pmc=3021511| doi = 10.1038/nrc2901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many identified enzymes have not been sufficiently characterized to yield actionable mechanisms on which to base [[Assay|functional assays]]. Without a basis for a functional [[Biochemical assay|biochemical readout]], chemical tools are required to detect drug-protein interactions.

=== Activity-based protein profiling ===
Activity-based protein profiling ('''ABPP''', also [[activity-based proteomics]]) is a technique that was developed to monitor the availability of enzymatic [[active site]]s to their [[endogenous]] [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] uses specially designed [[Chemical probe|probes]] that enter and form a [[covalent bond]] with an enzyme's [[active site]], which confirms that the enzyme is an active state.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geoghegan KF, Johnson DS |title=Chemical Proteomic Technologies for Drug Target Identification |date=2010 | doi = 10.1016/s0065-7743(10)45021-6 | journal = Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry |volume=45 |pages=345–360 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780123809025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The probe is typically an analog of the drug whose mechanism is being studied, so covalent labeling of an enzyme is indicative of drug binding. [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] [[Chemical probe|probes]] are designed with three key functional units: (1) a site-directed [[Targeted covalent inhibitors|covalent warhead]] (reactive group); (2) a reporter tag, such as [[biotin]] or [[rhodamine]]; and (3) a linker group.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang S, Tian Y, Wang M, Wang M, Sun GB, Sun XB | title = Advanced Activity-Based Protein Profiling Application Strategies for Drug Development | journal = Frontiers in Pharmacology | volume = 9 | pages = 353 | date = 2018-04-09 | pmid = 29686618 | doi = 10.3389/fphar.2018.00353 | pmc = 5900428 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site-directed covalent warhead, also called a covalent modifier, is an [[electrophile]] that covalently modifies a [[serine]], [[cysteine]], or [[lysine]] [[Amino acid residue|residue]] in the enzyme's active site and prevents future interactions with other ligands.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] [[Chemical probe|probes]] are generally designed against enzymatic classes, and thus can provide systems-level information about the impact of cell state on enzymatic networks. The reporter tag is used to confirm labeling of the enzyme with the reactive group and can vary depending on the downstream readout. The most widely used reporters are [[Fluorescent tag|fluorescent moieties]] that enable imaging and [[affinity tags]], such as [[biotin]], that allow for [[Pull down assay|pull-down]] of labeled enzymes and analysis via [[mass spectrometry]]. There are drawbacks to each strategy, namely that [[Fluorescent tag|fluorescent reporters]] do not allow for enrichment for proteomic analysis, while biotin-based affinity tags co-purify with [[Endogenous ligand|endogenously]] [[Biotinylation|biotinylated]] proteins.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A linker group is used to connect the reactive group to the reporter, ideally in a manner that does not alter the activity of [[Chemical probe|probe]]. The most common linker groups are long [[alkyl chain]]s, derivatized [[Polyethylene glycol|PEGs]], and modified [[polypeptides]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Under the assumption that enzymes vary in their structure, function, and associations depending on a system's [[Physiological condition|physiological]] or developmental state, it can be inferred that the accessibility of an enzyme's active site will also vary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the ability of an [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] [[Chemical probe|probe]] to label an enzyme will also vary across conditions. Thus, the binding of a probe can reveal information around an enzyme's functional characteristics in different contexts. [[High-throughput screening]] has benefitted from [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]], particularly in the area of [[competitive inhibition]] assays, in which biological samples are pre-incubated with drug candidates, then made to compete with [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] [[Chemical probe|probes]] for binding to target enzymes. Compounds with high [[Affinity (biochemistry)|affinity]] to their targets will prevent binding of the probe, and the degree of probe binding can be used as an indication of compound affinity. Because [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] [[Chemical probe|probes]] label classes of enzymes, this approach can also be used to profile drug selectivity, as highly selective compounds will ideally outcompete probes at only a small number of proteins.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Photoaffinity_labeling.png|thumb|380x380px|'''&lt;small&gt;A prototypical photoaffinity probe.&lt;/small&gt;''' &lt;small&gt;A drug scaffold acts as the first interaction site between [[Chemical probe|probe]] and protein. A [[Photochemistry|photoreactive group]], here an [[Phenyl azide|arylazide]], can be activated by light to form a [[reactive intermediate]] that [[Chemical bond|bonds]] with a non-specific site on the protein. A tag can then be used to enrich and identify or image and detect the target. This image was made using [https://www.biorender.com/ BioRender.com].&lt;/small&gt;]]

=== Photoaffinity labeling ===
Unlike [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]], which results in protein labeling upon [[Chemical probe|probe]] binding, [[photoaffinity labeling]] probes require activation by [[Photodissociation|photolysis]] before [[covalent bond]]ing to a protein occurs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The presence of a [[Photochemistry|photoreactive group]] makes this possible.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These probes are composed of three connected [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]]: (1) a drug scaffold; (2) a [[Photochemistry|photoreactive group]], such as an [[Phenyl azide|phenylazide]], phenyldiazirine, or [[benzophenone]]; and (3) an identification tag, such as [[biotin]], a [[fluorescent dye]], or a [[click chemistry]] handle.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith E, Collins I | title = Photoaffinity labeling in target- and binding-site identification | journal = Future Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–183 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25686004 | doi = 10.4155/fmc.14.152| pmc=4413435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug scaffold is typically an [[Structural analog|analog]] of a drug whose mechanism is being studied, and, importantly, [[Reversible inhibition|binds to the target reversibly]], which better mimics the interaction between most drugs and their targets.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; There are several varieties of photoreactive groups, but they are fundamentally different from [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] probes: while [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] specifically labels [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]] [[amino acid]]s in a target's [[active site]], [[photoaffinity labeling]] is non-specific, and thus is applicable to labeling a wider range of targets.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The identification tag will vary depending on the type of analysis being done: [[biotin]] and [[click chemistry]] handles are suitable for enrichment of labeled proteins prior to [[mass spectrometry]] based identification, while [[fluorescent dyes]] are used when using a [[Gel electrophoresis of proteins|gel-based imaging]] method, such as [[SDS-PAGE]], to validate interaction with a target.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
[[File:Phenyl_azide_Structural_Formula_V1.svg|left|thumb|137x137px|'''&lt;small&gt;Phenylazide, a photoreactive group commonly used in photoaffinity labeling.&lt;/small&gt;''']]
Because photoaffinity probes are multifunctional, they are difficult to design. Chemists incorporate the same principles of [[Structure–activity relationship|structure-activity relationship modeling]] into photoaffinity probes that apply to drugs, but must do so without compromising the drug scaffold's activity or the photoreactive group's ability to bond.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Since photoreactive groups bond indiscriminately, improper design can cause the probe to label itself or non-target proteins. The probe must remain stable in storage, across [[Buffers (chemistry)|buffers]], at various [[pH]] levels, and in living systems to ensure that labeling occurs only when exposed to light. Activation by light must also be fine-tuned, as [[radiation]] can damage cells.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[File:Immobilization_Strategies_for_Target_Identification.png|thumb|670x670px|&lt;small&gt;'''Three strategies for immobilization-based target identification.''' In all cases, [[protein]] mixtures are incubated with the [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] and bound [[Biological target|targets]] are detected downstream.

(1B) [[Ligand (biochemistry)|Ligands]] bind [[Biological target|targets]] in solution, and are then pulled down by an enrichment handle, such as [[biotin]]. (1C) [[Ligand (biochemistry)|Ligands]] contain a [[cross-link]]ing group, which is activated, often with light, labeling the target. An enrichment handle is used to pull down the labeled [[Biological target|target]]. (2) After attachment, the [[Biological target|target]] can be eluted from the [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] or [[Trypsinization|trypsinized]] directly on-bead. [[Trypsinization|Trypsinized]] [[peptide]]s are analyzed via [[LC-MS/MS]]. This image was adapted from [https://www.biorender.com/ BioRender.com].&lt;/small&gt;]]
Immobilization-based chemoproteomic techniques encompass variations on [[Microbead (research)|microbead]]-based affinity pull-down, which is similar to [[immunoprecipitation]], and [[affinity chromatography]]. In both cases, a solid support is used as an immobilization surface bearing a bait molecule. The bait molecule can be a potential drug if the investigator is trying to identify targets, or a target, such as an [[immobilized enzyme]], if the investigator is screening for small molecules.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen X, Wang Y, Ma N, Tian J, Shao Y, Zhu B, Wong YK, Liang Z, Zou C, Wang J | display-authors = 6 | title = Target identification of natural medicine with chemical proteomics approach: probe synthesis, target fishing and protein identification | journal = Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 72 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32435053 | doi = 10.1038/s41392-020-0186-y | pmc=7239890 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bait is exposed to a mixture of potential binding partners, which can be identified after removing non-binding components.

=== Microbead-based immobilization ===
[[Microbead (research)|Microbead]]-based immobilization is a modular technique in that it allows the investigator to decide whether they wish to fish for protein targets from the [[proteome]] or drug-like compounds from [[Chemical library|chemical libraries]]. The [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] properties of [[Microbead (research)|microbeads]] make them amenable to relatively low labor enrichment applications, since they are easily to visualize and their bulk mass is readily removable protein solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hou X, Sun M, Bao T, Xie X, Wei F, Wang S | title = Recent advances in screening active components from natural products based on bioaffinity techniques | journal = Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica. B | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 1800–1813 | date = October 2020 | pmid = 33163336 | doi = 10.1016/j.apsb.2020.04.016 |pmc=7606101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microbeads]] were historically made of inert [[polymer]]s, such as [[agarose]] and [[dextran]], that are [[Derivatization|functionalized]] to attach a bait of choice. In the case of using proteins as bait, [[amine]] functional groups are common linkers to facilitate attachment. More modern approaches have benefitted from the popularization of [[dynabeads]], a type of magnetic [[Microbead (research)|microbead]], which enable [[Magnetism|magnetic]] separation of bead-immobilized [[analyte]]s from treated samples. Magnetic beads exhibit [[Superparamagnetism|superparamagnetic]] properties, which make them very easy to remove from solution using an external [[magnet]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhuo R, Liu H, Liu N, Wang Y | title = Ligand Fishing: A Remarkable Strategy for Discovering Bioactive Compounds from Complex Mixture of Natural Products | journal = Molecules | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | pages = 1516 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27845727 | doi = 10.3390/molecules21111516 | pmc = 6274472 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a simplified workflow, magnetic beads are used to immobilize a [[protein]] target, then the beads are mixed with a [[chemical library]] to screen for potential [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]]. High-affinity ligands bind to the immobilized target and resist removal by washing, so they are enriched in the sample. Conversely, a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] of interest can be immobilized and screened against [[proteome]] proteins by incubation with a [[lysate]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Hybrid solution- and immobilization-based strategies have been applied, in which [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] functionalized with an enrichment tag, such as [[Biotinylation|biotin]], are allowed to float freely in solution and find their target proteins. After an incubation period, ligand-protein complexes can be reacted with [[streptavidin]]-coated beads, which bind the [[biotin]] tag and allow for pull-down and identification of interaction partners. This technology can be extended to assist with preparation of samples for [[Activity-based proteomics|ABPP]] and [[photoaffinity labeling]]. While immobilization approaches have been reproducible and successful, it is impossible to avoid the limitation of immobilization-induced [[steric hindrance]], which interferes with [[Induced fit model|induced fit]]. Another drawback is non-specific [[adsorption]] of both proteins and small molecules to the bead surface, which has the potential to generate [[False positives and false negatives|false positives.]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Affinity chromatography ===
[[Affinity chromatography]] emerged in the 1950s as a rarely used method used to purify enzymes; it has since seen mainstream use and is the oldest among chemoproteomic approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Turkov J |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/476215351|title=Affinity Chromatography.|date=1978|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-085812-8|oclc=476215351}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Affinity chromatography]] is performed following one of two basic formats: ligand immobilization or target immobilization. Under the ligand immobilization format, a ligand of interest - often a drug lead - is immobilized within a [[chromatography column]] and acts as the [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]]. A complex sample consisting of many proteins, such as a [[cell lysate]], is passed through the [[Chromatography column|column]] and the target of interest binds to the immobilized ligand while other sample components pass through the [[Chromatography column|column]] unretained. Under the target immobilization format, a target of interest - often a disease-relevant protein - is immobilized within a [[chromatography column]] and acts as the [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]]. Pooled [[Compound library|compound libraries]] are then passed through the column in an application [[Buffer solution|buffer]], ligands are retained through binding interactions with the [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]], and other compounds pass through the [[Chromatography column|column]] unretained.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez EL, Poddar S, Iftekhar S, Suh K, Woolfork AG, Ovbude S, Pekarek A, Walters M, Lott S, Hage DS | display-authors = 6 | title = Affinity chromatography: A review of trends and developments over the past 50 years | journal = Journal of Chromatography.

== Derivatization-free approaches ==
[[File:Thermal_Proteome_Profiling.png|thumb|420x420px|&lt;small&gt;'''An example thermal proteome profiling workflow.''' Binding of a drug to a protein often leads to ligand-induced stabilization of the protein (1), which can be measured by comparing the amount of non-denatured protein remaining in a drug-treated sample to an untreated control. The change in protein stability can be visualized as a rightward shift in its stability curve (2). This image was adapted from [https://www.biorender.com/ BioRender.com].&lt;/small&gt;]]
While the approaches above have shown success, they are inherently limited by their need for [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatization]], which jeopardizes the affinity of the interaction that [[Derivatization|derivatized]] compounds are said to emulate and introduces [[steric hindrance]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Immobilized [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] and [[Biological target|targets]] are limited in their ability to move freely through space in a way that replicates the native protein-ligand interaction, and [[conformational change]] from induced fit is often limited when proteins or drugs are immobilized. [[Chemical probe|Probe]]-based approaches also alter the three-dimensional nature of the ligand-protein interaction by introducing [[functional group]]s to the ligand, which can alter compound activity. [[Derivatization]]-free approaches aim to infer interactions by proxy, often through observations of changes to protein stability upon binding, and sometimes through [[Resolution (chromatography)|chromatographic co-elution]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ha J, Park H, Park J, Park SB | title = Recent advances in identifying protein targets in drug discovery | journal = Cell Chemical Biology | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 394–423 | date = March 2021 | pmid = 33357463 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.12.001 | s2cid = 229693161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stability-based methods below are thought to work due to [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-induced shifts in equilibrium concentrations of protein [[Conformational change|conformational states]]. A single protein type in [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] may be represented by individual molecules in a variety of [[Conformational isomerism|conformations]], with many of them different from one another despite being identical in [[amino acid]] sequence. Upon binding a [[drug]], the majority of ligand-bound [[protein]] enters an [[energetically favorable]] conformation, and moves away from the unpredictable distribution of less stable conformers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lomenick B, Olsen RW, Huang J | title = Identification of direct protein targets of small molecules | journal = ACS Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–46 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21077692 |  pmc=3031183 |doi = 10.1021/cb100294v }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ligand binding is said to stabilize proteins, making them resistant to [[Protein denaturation|thermal]], [[Proteolysis|enzymatic]] and chemical degradation. Some examples of stability-based derivatization-free approaches follow.

=== Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) ===
Thermal proteome profiling (also, [[Cellular thermal shift assay|Cellular Thermal Shift Assay]]) is recently popularized strategy to infer [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-[[protein]] interactions from shifts in protein thermal stability induced by ligand binding. In a typical [[assay]] setup, protein-containing samples are exposed to a ligand of choice, then those samples are [[Aliquot (disambiguation)|aliquoted]] and heated to separate individual temperature points. Upon binding to a ligand, a protein's [[thermal stability]] is expected to increase, so ligand-bound proteins will be more resistant to thermal denaturation. After heating, the amount of non-denatured protein remaining is analyzed using [[quantitative proteomics]] and stability curves are generated. Upon comparison to an untreated stability curve, the treated curve is expected to shift to the right, indicating that ligand-induced stabilization occurred. Historically, thermal proteome profiling has been assessed using a [[western blot]] against a known target of interest. With the advent of [[Orbitrap|high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometers]], this type of experiment can be executed on a [[proteome]]-wide scale and stability curves can be generated for thousands of proteins at once. Thermal proteome profiling has been successfully performed ''[[in vitro]], [[in situ]],'' and ''[[in vivo]]''. When coupled with [[mass spectrometry]], this technique is referred to as the Mass Spectrometry Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (MS-[[CETSA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mateus A, Kurzawa N, Becher I, Sridharan S, Helm D, Stein F, Typas A, Savitski MM | display-authors = 6 | title = Thermal proteome profiling for interrogating protein interactions | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = e9232 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 32133759 | doi = 10.15252/msb.20199232| pmc=7057112  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DARTS.png|thumb|569x569px|'''&lt;small&gt;An example drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) workflow.&lt;/small&gt;''' &lt;small&gt;Binding of a drug to a protein often leads to ligand-induced stabilization of the protein. In DARTS, drug and control treated proteins are subjected to limited [[proteolysis]] and the extent of protein digestion can either be visualized on a [[Gel electrophoresis of proteins|gel]] or measured by [[mass spectrometry]]. Drug binding is expected to result in an increase in signal of the stabilized protein.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;This image was made using  [https://www.biorender.com/ BioRender.com].&lt;/small&gt;]]

=== Drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) ===
The Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability [[assay]] follows a similar basic assumption to TPP – that protein stability is increased by ligand binding. In DARTS, however, protein stability is assessed in response to digestion by a [[protease]]. Briefly, a sample of [[cell lysate]] is incubated with a small molecule of interest, the sample is split into aliquots, and each aliquot goes through limited [[proteolysis]] after addition of [[protease]]. Limited [[proteolysis]] is critical, since complete proteolysis would render even a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-bound [[protein]] completely [[Proteolysis|digested]]. Samples are then analyzed via [[SDS-PAGE]] to assess differences in extent of digestion, and bands are then excised and analyzed via mass spectrometry to confirm the identities of proteins that are resist [[proteolysis]]. Alternatively, if the target is already suspected and is being tested for validation, a [[western blot]] protocol can be used to identify [[protein]] directly.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lomenick B, Hao R, Jonai N, Chin RM, Aghajan M, Warburton S, Wang J, Wu RP, Gomez F, Loo JA, Wohlschlegel JA, Vondriska TM, Pelletier J, Herschman HR, Clardy J, Clarke CF, Huang J | display-authors = 6 | title = Target identification using drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 51 | pages = 21984–21989 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19995983 | pmc = 2789755 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0910040106 | bibcode = 2009PNAS..10621984L | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SPROX.png|thumb|569x569px|'''&lt;small&gt;An example stability of proteins from rates of oxidation (SPROX) workflow.&lt;/small&gt;''' &lt;small&gt;Binding of a drug to a protein often leads to ligand-induced stabilization of the protein. In SPROX, drug and control treated proteins samples are exposed to increasing amounts of a [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturant]]. [[Hydrogen peroxide]] is added to [[oxidize]] exposed [[Methionine|methionine residues]]. Drug binding is expected to protect methionine from oxidation by stabilizing the [[Folded protein|folded]] form of a protein. Extent of oxidation can be monitored by [[mass spectrometry]] and used to generate stability curves.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;This image was made using  [https://www.biorender.com/ BioRender.com].&lt;/small&gt;]]

=== Stability of proteins from rates of oxidation (SPROX) ===
Stability of Proteins from Rates of Oxidation also rests upon the assumption that [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] binding confers protection to proteins from manners of degradation, this time from [[oxidation]] of [[Methionine|methionine residues]]. In SPROX, a lysate is split and treated with drug or a DMSO control, then each group is further aliquoted into separate samples with increasing concentrations of the [[Chaotropic agent|chaotrope]] and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturant]] [[Guanidinium chloride|guanidinium hydrochloride]] (GuHCl). Depending on the concentration of [[Guanidinium hydrochloride|GuHCl]], proteins will unfold to varying degrees. Each sample is then reacted with [[hydrogen peroxide]], which [[oxidizes]] [[Methionine|methionine residues]]. Proteins that are stabilized by the drug will remain folded at higher concentrations of GuHCl and will experience less methionine oxidation. Oxidized methionine residues can be quantified via [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS/MS]] and used to generate methionine stability curves, which are a proxy for drug binding. There are drawbacks to the SPROX assay, namely that the only relevant peptides from SPROX samples are those with methionine residues, which account for approximately one-third of [[peptide]]s, and for which there are currently no viable enrichment techniques. Only those [[methionine]]s that are exposed to [[oxidation]] provide meaningful information, and not all differences in methionine oxidation are consistent with protein stabilization. Without enrichment, [[LC-MS/MS]] analysis of these [[peptide]]s is challenging, as the contribution of other sample components to [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] noise can drown out relevant signal. Therefore, SPROX samples require [[fractionation]] to concentrate [[peptide]]s of interest prior to [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS/MS]] analysis.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Affinity selection-mass spectrometry ===
While adoption of affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS) has led to an expansion of [[assay]] formats,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Annis DA, Nickbarg E, Yang X, Ziebell MR, Whitehurst CE | title = Affinity selection-mass spectrometry screening techniques for small molecule drug discovery | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 518–526 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17931956 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.07.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the general technique follows a simple scheme. [[Protein]] targets are incubated with [[small molecule]]s to allow for the formation of stable [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-[[protein]] complexes, unbound [[small molecule]]s are removed from the mixture, and the components of remaining [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-[[protein]] complexes are analyzed using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The bound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] identified are then categorized as [[Hit selection|hits]] and can be used to provide a starting point for [[lead generation]]. Since AS-MS measures binding in an unbiased manner, a [[Hit selection|hit]] does not need to be tied to a functional readout, opening the possibility of identifying [[drug]]s that act beyond [[active site]]s, such as [[allosteric modulator]]s and [[chemical chaperone]]s, all in a single [[assay]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Prudent R, Annis DA, Dandliker PJ, Ortholand JY, Roche D |date=2020-10-21|title=Exploring new targets and chemical space with affinity selection-mass spectrometry |journal=Nature Reviews Chemistry |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=62–71 |doi=10.1038/s41570-020-00229-2 |s2cid=224811862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[small molecule]]s can be directly identified by their [[exact mass]], no [[derivatization]] is needed to confirm the validity of a hit.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Among [[derivatization]]- and label-free approaches, AS-MS has the unique advantage of being amenable to the assessment of multiple test [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]] per experiment—as many as 20,000 [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]] per experiment have been reported in the literature, and one group has reported assaying [[Chemical library|chemical libraries]] against [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] [[protein]] pools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The basic steps of AS-MS are described in more detail below.
[[File:TIFF_Workflow_copy_(3).png|thumb|332x332px|'''&lt;small&gt;Affinity selection via gel filtration.&lt;/small&gt;''' &lt;small&gt;A pool of test compounds is added to a protein sample, which is passed through a [[gel filtration]] [[Column chromatography|column]]. Protein-bound compounds move around the beads and exit the column quickly. Unbound compounds are small enough to travel through beads and take a longer path before elution. This image was made using [https://www.biorender.com/ BioRender.com].&lt;/small&gt;]]

==== Affinity selection ====
A generalized AS-MS workflow begins with the pre-incubation of [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|purified protein]] [[Solution (chemistry)|solutions]] (i.e. [[target protein]]s) with [[Chemical library|chemical libraries]] in [[microplate]]s. [[Assay]]s can be designed to contain sufficiently high [[protein]] concentrations to prevent [[Competitive inhibition|competition for binding sites]] between [[structural analog]]s, ensuring that [[Hit selection|hits]] across a range of [[Affinity (biochemistry)|affinities]] can be identified; inversely, [[assay]]s can contain low [[protein]] concentrations to allow for distinction between high and low [[Affinity (biochemistry)|affinity]] [[Structural analog|analogs]] and to inform [[Structure–activity relationship|structure-activity relationships]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The choice of a [[chemical library]] is less stringent than other [[high-throughput screening]] strategies owing to the lack of functional readouts, which would otherwise require deconvolution of the source compound that generates [[biological activity]]. Thus, the typical range for AS-MS is 400-3,000 [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]] per pool.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other considerations for screening are more practical, such as a need to balance desired [[Compound (chemistry)|compound]] concentration, which is usually in the [[micromolar]] range, with the fact that compound [[stock solution]]s are typically stored as 10 [[millimolar]] [[Solution (chemistry)|solutions]], effectively capping the number of [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]] screened in the thousands.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After appropriate test [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]] and [[Biological target|targets]] are selected and incubated, [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-[[protein]] complexes can be separated by a variety of means.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Separation of unbound small molecules and ligand-protein complexes ====
Affinity selection is followed by the removal of unbound [[small molecule]]s via [[ultrafiltration]] or [[size-exclusion chromatography]], making only [[protein]]-bound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] available for downstream analysis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Several types of [[ultrafiltration]] have been reported with varying degrees of [[throughput]], including pressure-based, [[Centrifuge|centrifugal]], and [[Protein precipitation|precipitation]]-based [[ultrafiltration]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Under both pressure-based and [[Centrifuge|centrifugal]] formats, unbound [[small molecule]]s are forced through a [[semipermeable membrane]] that excludes [[protein]]s on the basis of size. Multiple washing steps are required after [[ultrafiltration]] to ensure complete removal of unbound [[small molecule]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Ultrafiltration]] can also be [[Confounding|confounded]] by [[Adsorption|non-specific adsorption]] of unbound [[small molecule]]s to the [[Semipermeable membrane|membrane]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A group at the [[University of Illinois Chicago|University of Illinois]] published a screening strategy involving [[Amyloid beta|amyloid-beta]], in which [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] were used to stabilize the protein and prevent its aggregation. [[Ultrafiltration]] was used to [[Protein precipitation|precipitate]] [[Protein aggregation|aggregated]] [[Amyloid beta|amyloid-beta]] and remove unbound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]], while the [[Chemical chaperone|ligand-stabilized protein]] was detected and quantified using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Size-exclusion chromatography]] (SEC) is more widely used in [[Pharmaceutical industry|industrial]] [[drug discovery]] and has the advantage of more efficient removal of unbound [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]] as compared to [[ultrafiltration]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Size-exclusion chromatography|Size-exclusion]] approaches have been described in both [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) based and spin column formats.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In either case, a mixture of unbound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]], [[protein]]s, ligand-protein complexes is passed through a [[Column chromatography|column]] of porous beads. [[Ligand (biochemistry)|Ligand]]-[[protein]] complexes are excluded from entering the beads and exit the [[Column chromatography|column]] quickly, while unbound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] must travel through the beads and are retained by the [[Column chromatography|column]] for a longer time. [[Ligand (biochemistry)|Ligands]] that elute from the [[Column chromatography|column]] early on are therefore inferred to be bound to a [[protein]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The automated ligand identification system (ALIS), developed by [[Schering-Plough]], uses a combined [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]-based [[Size-exclusion chromatography|SEC]] to [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS) system that separates [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-[[protein]] complexes from unbound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] using [[Size-exclusion chromatography|SEC]] and diverts the complex toward an [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] system for on-line analysis of bound ligands.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Novartis]]' SpeedScreen uses [[Size-exclusion chromatography|SEC]] in [[96 well plate|96-well]] spin [[Column chromatography|column]] format, also known as [[gel filtration chromatography]], which allows for simultaneous removal of unbound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] from up to 96 samples.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zehender H, Le Goff F, Lehmann N, Filipuzzi I, Mayr LM | title = SpeedScreen: The "missing link" between genomics and lead discovery | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Screening | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 498–505 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15452336 | doi = 10.1177/1087057104267605 | s2cid = 7135803 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples are also passed through porous beads, but [[centrifugation]] is used to move the sample through the [[Column chromatography|column]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; SpeedScreen is not coupled to an [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] system and requires further processing prior to final analysis. In this case, [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] must be freed from their targets and analyzed separately.

==== Analysis of bound ligands ====
The final step requires [[Bioanalysis|bioanalytical]] separation of bound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] from their [[Biological target|targets]], and subsequent identification of [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] using [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; AS-MS offers means for identifying [[small molecule]]-[[protein]] interactions either directly - through [[Top-down proteomics|top-down proteomic]] detection of intact complexes - or indirectly - through [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of [[small molecule]]-[[protein]] complexes followed by identification of [[small molecule]]s using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[Top-down proteomics|top-down]] approach requires direct infusion of the complex into an [[electrospray ionization]] [[mass spectrometry]] source under conditions gentle enough to preserve the interaction and maintain its integrity in the [[Phase transition|transition]] from [[liquid]] to [[gas]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While this was shown to be possible by Ganem and Henion in 1991, it is not suitable for [[High-throughput screening|high throughput]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Interestingly, [[Electron-capture dissociation|electron capture dissociation]], which is typically used in [[Chemical structure|structure]] elucidation of [[peptide]]s, has been used to identify [[Binding site|ligand binding sites]] during [[Top-down proteomics|top-down]] analysis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A simpler method for analysis of bound [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] uses a [[Protein precipitation|protein precipitation extraction]] to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] [[protein]]s and release [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] into the precipitation solution, which can then be [[Concentration|diluted]] and identified on an [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] system.

=== Target identification by chromatographic co-elution (TICC) ===
Target identification by [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] co-elution does not rely on differences in protein stability after drug treatment. Instead, it rests on the assumption that [[drug]]s form stable complexes with their [[Biological target|target]] [[proteins]], and that those complexes are robust enough to survive a [[chromatographic separation]]. In a typical workflow, a [[cell lysate]] is incubated with a drug, then the lysate is injected onto an [[Ion Exchange Chromatography|ion-exchange chromatography]] system and [[Fractionation|fractionated]]. Lysate proteins are [[Elution|eluted]] along an [[ionic strength]] gradient and fractions are collected over short time intervals. Each fraction is analyzed by LC-MS/MS for both [[protein]] and [[drug]] content. Individual proteins elute with characteristic profiles, and pre-incubated drugs should mirror the elution profiles of the targets they complex with. Correlation of drug and protein elution profiles allows for targets to be narrowed down and inferred.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan JN, Vuckovic D, Sleno L, Olsen JB, Pogoutse O, Havugimana P, Hewel JA, Bajaj N, Wang Y, Musteata MF, Nislow C, Emili A | display-authors = 6 | title = Target identification by chromatographic co-elution: monitoring of drug-protein interactions without immobilization or chemical derivatization | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = M111.016642 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22357554 | pmc = 3394955 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M111.016642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational approaches ==

=== Molecular docking simulations ===
The development and application of bench-top chemoproteomics assays is often time consuming and cost-prohibitive. [[Molecular Docking|Molecular docking]] simulations have emerged as relatively low-cost, high-throughput means for ranking the strength of small molecule-protein interactions. [[Molecular Docking|Molecular docking]] requires accurate modeling of both ligand and protein conformation at atomic resolution, and is therefore aided by empirical determination of protein structure, often through orthogonal methods such as [[x-ray crystallography]] and [[Cryo em|cryogenic electron microscopy]]. [[Molecular Docking|Molecular docking]] strategies are categorized by the type of information that is already known about the ligand and protein of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meng XY, Zhang HX, Mezei M, Cui M | title = Molecular docking: a powerful approach for structure-based drug discovery | journal = Current Computer-Aided Drug Design | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 146–157 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21534921 | doi = 10.2174/157340911795677602 | pmc = 3151162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ligand-based methods ====
[[File:PharmacophoreModel_example.svg|thumb|369x369px|'''&lt;small&gt;An example pharmacophore model. Each sphere represents a different scorable feature.&lt;/small&gt;''']]
When a [[Biological activity|bioactive]] ligand with a known structure is to be screened against a protein with limited structural information, modeling is done with regard to ligand structure. [[Pharmacophore]] modeling identifies key electronic and structural features that are associated with therapeutic activity across similarly bioactive [[Analog (chemistry)|structural analogs]], and accordingly requires large [[Chemical library|libraries]] with corresponding experimental data to enhance predictive power. Compound structures are superimposed virtually and common elements are scored on the basis of their tendency toward bioactivity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang SY | title = Pharmacophore modeling and applications in drug discovery: challenges and recent advances | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 15 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 444–450 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20362693 | doi = 10.1016/j.drudis.2010.03.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move away from [[Lock and key model|lock-and-key]] based modeling toward [[Induced fit model|induced-fit]] based modeling has improved binding predictions but has also given rise to the challenge of modeling ligand flexibility, which requires building a database of conformational models and utilizes large amounts of data storage space. Another approach is the so-called on-the-fly method, in which conformational models are tested during the process of [[pharmacophore]] modeling, without a database; this method requires significantly less storage space at the cost of high computing time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A second challenge arises from the decision of how to superimpose analog structures. A common approach is to use a [[Least squares regression|least-squares regression]] for superimposition, but this requires user-selected anchor points and therefore introduces human bias into the process. [[Pharmacophore]] models require training data sets, giving rise to another challenge—selection of the appropriate [[Chemical library|library of compounds]] to adequately train models. Data set size and chemical diversity significantly affect performance of the downstream product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khedkar SA, Malde AK, Coutinho EC, Srivastava S | title = Pharmacophore modeling in drug discovery and development: an overview | journal = Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–197 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17348856 | doi = 10.2174/157340607780059521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Structure-based methods ====
Ideally, the structure of a drug target is known, which allows for [[Structure-based drug design|structure-based]] pharmacophore modeling. A structure-based model integrates key structural properties of the protein's binding site, such as the spatial distribution of interaction points, with features identified from ligand based pharmacophore models to generate a holistic simulation of the ligand-protein interaction. A major challenge in structure-based modeling is to narrow down pharmacophore features, of which many are initially identified, to a set of high priority features, as modeling too many features is a computational challenge. Another challenge is the incompatibility of [[pharmacophore]] modeling with [[QSAR|quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)]] profiling. Accurate [[Quantitative structure–activity relationship|QSAR]] models rely on inclusion of many potential targets, not just the therapeutic target. For example, important [[pharmacophore]]s may yield high-affinity interactions with therapeutic targets, but they may also lead to undesirable [[off-target activity]], and they may also be substrates of metabolic enzymes, such as [[Cytochrome P450]]s. Therefore, [[pharmacophore]] modeling against therapeutic targets is only one component of the compound's total [[Structure–activity relationship|structure-activity relationship]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Druggability ===
[[File:Proteolysis_targeting_chimera_mechanism.svg|thumb|421x421px|&lt;small&gt;'''PROTAC: Proteolysis targeting chimera'''. [[Proteolysis targeting chimera|PROTACs]] are heterobifunctional small molecules that contain a functional group that binds a target and another functional group that recruits an [[E3 Ubiquitin Ligase|E3 ubiquitin ligase.]] Binding to both proteins induces proximity-based [[ubiquitination]] of the target by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to target degradation.&lt;/small&gt;]]
Chemoproteomic strategies have been used to expand the scope of [[Druggability|druggable]] targets.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spradlin JN, Zhang E, Nomura DK | title = Reimagining Druggability Using Chemoproteomic Platforms | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 54 | issue = 7 | pages = 1801–1813 | date = April 2021 | pmid = 33733731 | doi = 10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00065 | s2cid = 232303398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While historically successful drugs target well-defined [[binding pocket]]s of druggable proteins, these define only about 15% of the annotated [[proteome]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; To continue growing our [[pharmacopoeia]], bold approaches to ligand discovery are required. The use of ABPP has coincidentally reinvigorated the search for newly ligandable sites. ABPP probes, intentionally used to label enzyme [[active site]]s, have been found to label many [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]] regions on many different proteins unintentionally. Originally thought to be experimental noise, these unintended reactions have clued researchers to the presence of sites that can potentially be targeted by novel [[Irreversible inhibitor|covalent drugs]]. This is particularly salient in the case of proteins with no enzymatic activity to inhibit, or with mutated drug resistant proteins. In any of these cases, proteins can potentially be targeted for degradation using the novel drug modality of [[PROTACs|proteolysis-targeting-chimeras (PROTACs)]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; PROTACs are heterobifunctional small molecules that are designed to interact with a target and an [[E3 Ubiquitin Ligase|E3 ubiquitin ligase]]. The interaction brings the E3 ubiquitin ligase close enough to the target that the target is labeled for degradation. The existence of potential covalent binding sites across the proteome suggests that many drugs can be covalently targeted using such a modality.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Drug repurposing ===
Chemoproteomics is at the forefront of [[drug repurposing]]. This is particularly relevant in the era of [[COVID-19]], which saw a dire need to rapidly identify [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] [[approved drug]]s that have [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] activity.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haas P, Muralidharan M, Krogan NJ, Kaake RM, Hüttenhain R | title = Proteomic Approaches to Study SARS-CoV-2 Biology and COVID-19 Pathology | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 1133–1152 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33464917 | pmc = 7839417 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, a [[Phenotypic screening|phenotypic screen]] is usually employed to identify drugs with a desired effect ''[[in vitro]]'', such as inhibition of [[Viral plaque|viral plaque formation]]. If a drug produces a positive test, the next step is to determine whether it is acting on a known or novel target. Chemoproteomics is thus a follow-up to phenotypic screening. In the case of [[COVID-19]], Friman et al investigated off-target effects of the [[Broad-spectrum antiviral drug|broad-spectrum antiviral]] [[Remdesivir]], which was among the first repurposed drugs to be used in the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Remdesivir was tested via thermal proteome profiling in a [[Hep G2|HepG2]] [[cellular thermal shift assay]], along with the controversial drug [[hydroxychloroquine]], and investigators discovered [[TRIP13]] as a potential off-target of Remdesivir.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== High-throughput screening ===
Approved drugs are never identified as hits in [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput screens]] because the [[Chemical library|chemical libraries]] used in screening have not been optimized against any targets. However, methods like [[affinity chromatography]] and affinity selection-mass spectrometry are workhorses of the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and AS-MS particularly has been documented to produce a significant number of hits across many classes of difficult-to-drug [[proteins]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is due in large part to the sheer volume of [[ligand]]s that can be screened in a single assay. Researchers at the iHuman Institute at [[ShanghaiTech University]] employed of scheme in which 20,000 compounds per pool were screened against [[Adenosine A2A receptor|A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R]], a difficult [[G protein-coupled receptor|G-protein coupled receptor]] to drug, with a 0.12% hit rate, leading to several high affinity ligands.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

{{About|biological consumption of energy from inorganic compounds|chemical synthesis in molecular nanotechnology|Chemosynthesis (nanotechnology)}}

[[File:Venenivibrio.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Venenivibrio stagnispumantis]]'' gains energy by oxidizing hydrogen gas.]]

In biochemistry, '''chemosynthesis''' is the biological conversion of one or more carbon-containing molecules (usually [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]]) and nutrients into organic matter using the [[oxidation]] of inorganic compounds (e.g., [[hydrogen]] gas, [[hydrogen sulfide]]) or [[ferrous]] ions as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as in [[photosynthesis]]. [[Chemotroph|Chemoautotrophs]], [[organism]]s that obtain carbon from [[carbon dioxide]] through chemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse. Groups that include conspicuous or biogeochemically-important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing [[Gammaproteobacteria]], the [[Campylobacterota]], the [[Aquificota]], the [[methanogen]]ic archaea, and the neutrophilic [[iron-oxidizing bacteria]].

Many microorganisms in dark regions of the oceans use chemosynthesis to produce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be distinguished. In the rare sites where hydrogen molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are available, the energy available from the reaction between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (leading to production of methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can be large enough to drive the production of biomass. Alternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for chemosynthesis derives from reactions in which substances such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[ammonia]] are oxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.

Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations between chemosynthesizers and respiring heterotrophs are quite common. Large populations of animals can be supported by chemosynthetic [[secondary production]] at [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[methane clathrate]]s, [[cold seep]]s, [[whale fall]]s, and [[Movile Cave|isolated cave water]].

It has been hypothesized that anaerobic chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of [[life on Mars|Mars]], [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Chela-Flores]] (2000): "Terrestrial microbes as candidates for survival on Mars and Europa", in: Seckbach, Joseph (ed.) ''Journey to Diverse Microbial Worlds: Adaptation to Exotic Environments'', Springer, pp. 387–398. {{ISBN|0-7923-6020-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemosynthesis may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.

==Hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis process==

[[Giant tube worm]]s use bacteria in their [[trophosome]] to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]] (using [[hydrogen sulfide]] as their energy source) and produce sugars and [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biotechnology for Environmental Management and Resource Recovery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYJEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179 |publisher=Springer |year=2013 |isbn=978-81-322-0876-1 |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of releasing [[oxygen]] gas while fixing carbon dioxide as in [[photosynthesis]], hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis produces solid globules of [[sulfur]] in the process. In bacteria capable of chemoautotrophy (a form a chemosynthesis), such as [[purple sulfur bacteria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Purple Phototrophic Bacteria |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |others=Hunter, C.

==Discovery==
[[File:Gollner Riftia pachyptila.png|right|thumb| Giant tube worms (''[[Riftia pachyptila]]'') have an organ containing chemosynthetic bacteria instead of a gut.]]
In 1890, [[Sergei Winogradsky]] proposed a novel type of life process called "anorgoxydant". His discovery suggested that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter and emerged during his physiological research in the 1880s in [[Strasbourg]] and [[Zürich]] on sulfur, iron, and nitrogen bacteria.

In 1897, [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]] coined the term "chemosynthesis" for the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances, in association with [[autotrophy|autotrophic]] carbon dioxide assimilation—what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would be expanded to include also chemoorganoautotrophs, which are organisms that use organic energy substrates in order to assimilate carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kellerman |first1=M. Y. |first2=G. |last2=Wegener |first3=M. |last3=Elvert |first4=M. Y. |last4=Yoshinaga |first5=Y-S. |last5=Lin |first6=T. |last6=Holler |first7=X.

The term "[[chemotroph]]y", less restrictive, would be introduced in the 1940s by [[André Lwoff]] for the production of energy by the oxidation of electron donors, organic or not, associated with auto- or heterotrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kelly |first1=D.

The suggestion of Winogradsky was confirmed nearly 90 years later, when hydrothermal [[ocean]] vents were predicted to exist in the 1970s. The hot springs and strange creatures were discovered by ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', the world's first deep-sea submersible, in 1977 at the [[Galapagos Rift]]. At about the same time, then-graduate student [[Colleen Cavanaugh]] proposed chemosynthetic bacteria that oxidize sulfides or elemental sulfur as a mechanism by which [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]] could survive near hydrothermal vents. Cavanaugh later managed to confirm that this was indeed the method by which the worms could thrive, and is generally credited with the discovery of chemosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cavenaugh |first1=Colleen M. |first2=Stephen L. |last2=Gardiner |first3=Meredith L. |last3=Jones |first4=Holger W. |last4=Jannasch |first5=John B. |last5=Waterbury |display-authors=1 |title=Prokaryotic Cells in the Hydrothermal Vent Tube Worms ''Riftia'' Jones: Possible Chemoautotrophic Symbionts |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4505 |year=1981 |pages=340–342 |doi=10.1126/science.213.4505.340 |pmid=17819907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 [[television]] series hosted by [[Bill Nye]] named chemosynthesis as one of the 100 greatest scientific discoveries of all time.&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442715/ |title=100 Greatest Discoveries (2004–2005) |work=IMDb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/greatest-discoveries/videos/evolution.htm |title=Greatest Discoveries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319001453/http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/greatest-discoveries/videos/evolution.htm |archive-date=March 19, 2013 |work=Science }} Watch the "Greatest Discoveries in Evolution" online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanic crust===
In 2013, researchers reported their discovery of bacteria living in the rock of the [[oceanic crust]] below the thick layers of sediment, and apart from the hydrothermal vents that form along the edges of the [[tectonic plate]]s.  Preliminary findings are that these bacteria subsist on the hydrogen produced by chemical reduction of [[olivine]] by seawater circulating in the small veins that permeate the [[basalt]] that comprises oceanic crust.  The bacteria synthesize methane by combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130314144340.htm |title=Life deep within oceanic crust sustained by energy from interior of Earth |work=ScienceDaily |date=14 March 2013 |access-date=March 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemosynthesis as an innovation for researches ===
Despite the fact that the process of chemosynthesis has been known for more than a hundred years, its significance and importance are still relevant today in the transformation of chemical elements in biogeochemical cycles. Today, the vital processes of nitrifying bacteria, which lead to the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid, require scientific substantiation and additional research. The ability of bacteria to convert inorganic substances into organic ones suggests that chemosynthetics can accumulate valuable resources for human needs. 

Chemosynthetic communities in different environments are important biological systems in terms of their ecology, evolution and biogeography, as well as their potential as indicators of the availability of permanent hydrocarbon- based energy sources. In the process of chemosynthesis, bacteria produce organic matter where photosynthesis is impossible. Isolation of thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria ''Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii'' and other types of chemosynthetics provides prospects for further research. Thus, the importance of chemosynthesis remains relevant for use in innovative technologies, conservation of ecosystems, human life in general. The role of [[Sergei Winogradsky|Sergey Winogradsky]] in discovering the phenomenon of chemosynthesis is underestimated and needs further research and popularization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Paraska |first1=O.

[[File:Reaction scheme of Gánti's chemoton.png|thumb|400px|Reaction scheme of the chemoton, showing the interplay of metabolism, information and structural closure. Based on Fig. 1.1 of Gánti (2003)&lt;ref name=gantibook/&gt;]]The term '''chemoton''' (short for 'chemical [[automaton]]') refers to an abstract model for the fundamental unit of life introduced by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[theoretical biologist]] [[Tibor Gánti]]. Popular articles express surprise that Gánti's work is so little known.&lt;ref name="NG-20201214"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Michael |title=He may have found the key to the origins of life.

The basic assumption of the model is that life should fundamentally and essentially have three properties: [[metabolism]], [[self-replication]], and a [[Cell membrane|bilipid membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Van Segbroeck S, Nowé A, Lenaerts T |title= Stochastic simulation of the chemoton |journal= Artif Life |volume=15 |issue= 2 | pages= 213–226 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19199383|doi= 10.1162/artl.2009.15.2.15203|citeseerx= 10.1.1.398.8949 |s2cid= 10634307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic and replication functions together form an [[autocatalytic]] subsystem necessary for the basic functions of life, and a membrane encloses this subsystem to separate it from the surrounding environment. Therefore, any system having such properties may be regarded as alive, and it will be subjected to [[natural selection]] and contain a self-sustaining cellular information. Some consider this model a significant contribution to [[origin of life]] as it provides a philosophy of [[Unit of selection|evolutionary units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hoenigsberg HF |title=From geochemistry and biochemistry to prebiotic evolution...we necessarily enter into Gánti's fluid automata  |journal= Genet Mol Res |volume= 6|issue= 2 | pages= 358–373 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17624859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property==

The chemoton is a protocell that grows by metabolism, reproduces by biological [[Fission (biology)|fission]], and has at least rudimentary genetic variation. Thus, it contains three subsystems, namely an autocatalytic network for metabolism, a lipid bilayer for structural organisation, and a replicating machinery for information. Unlike cellular metabolic reactions, the metabolism of the chemoton is in an autonomous chemical cycle and is not dependent on enzymes. Autocatalysis produces its own structures and functions. Hence, the process itself has no hereditary variation. However, the model includes another molecule (''T'' in the diagram) that is spontaneously produced and is incorporated into the structure. This molecule is [[amphipathic]] like [[membrane lipids]], but it is highly dynamic, leaving small gaps that close and open frequently. This unstable structure is important for new amphipathic molecules to be added, so that a membrane is subsequently formed. This will become a microsphere. Due to metabolic reaction, [[osmotic pressure]] will build up inside the microsphere, and this will generate a force for invaginating the membrane, and ultimately division. In fact, this is close to the cell division of cell wall-less bacteria, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]''. Continuous reactions will also invariably produce variable polymers that can be inherited by daughter cells. In the advanced version of the chemoton, the hereditary information will act as a genetic material, something like a [[ribozyme]] of the [[RNA world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John Maynard Smith| author2=Eörs Száthmary |title= The Major Transitions in Evolution|year=1997 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UGCmIVB5dhMC&amp;q=chemoton |pages= 20–24 | publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=  9780198502944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

===Origin of life===

The primary use of the chemoton model is in the study of the chemical origin of life. Because the chemoton itself can be thought of as a primitive or minimal cellular life as it satisfies the definition of what a cell is (that it is a unit of biological activity enclosed by a membrane and capable of self-reproduction). Experimental demonstration showed that a synthesised chemoton can survive in a wide range of chemical solutions, it formed materials for its internal components, it metabolised its chemicals, and it grew in size and multiplied itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Csendes T |title=A Simulation study of the chemotron|journal= Kybernetes |volume=13 |issue= 2 | pages= 79–85 |year= 1984 |doi= 10.1108/eb005677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit of selection===

As it is scientifically hypothesised that the first replicating systems must be simple structure, most likely before any enzymes or templates existed, chemoton provides a plausible scenario. As an autocatalytic but non-genetic entity, it predates the enzyme-dependent precursors of life, such as RNA World. But being capable of self-replication and producing variant metabolites, it possibly could be an entity with the first biological evolution, therefore, the origin of the unit of Darwinian selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Laurent Keller |title= Levels of Selection in Evolution|year= 1999 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;q=chemoton |page= 52 | publisher= Princeton University Press  |isbn= 9780691007045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Munteanu A, Solé RV  |title= Phenotypic diversity and chaos in a minimal cell model |journal= J Theor Biol |volume= 240|issue= 3 | pages= 434–442 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16330052|doi= 10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pratt AJ |title= Prebiological Evolution and the Metabolic Origins of Life |journal= Artificial Life |volume= 17|issue= 3 | pages= 203–217 |year= 2011 |pmid= 21554111|doi= 10.1162/artl_a_00032|s2cid= 6988070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial life===
The chemoton has laid the foundation of some aspects of [[artificial life]]. The computational basis has become a topic of software development and experimentation in the investigation of artificial life.&lt;ref name=hug&gt;{{cite book| author=Hugues Bersini  |chapter= Minimal cell: the computer scientist's point of view|title= Origins and Evolution of Life: An Astrobiological Perspective|editor=Muriel Gargaud|editor2=Purificación López-Garcìa|editor3=Hervé Martin |year= 2011 | chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m3oFebknu1cC&amp;q=chemoton |pages= 60–61 | publisher= Cambridge University Press  |isbn= 9781139494595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason is that the chemoton simplifies the otherwise complex biochemical and molecular functions of living cells. Since the chemoton is a system consisting of a large but fixed number of interacting molecular species, it can effectively be implemented in a process algebra-based computer language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zachar I, Fedor A, Szathmáry E |title= Two different template replicators coexisting in the same protocell: stochastic simulation of an extended chemoton model |journal= PLOS ONE |volume=6 |issue= 7 | pages= 1380 |year= 2011 |pmid=21818258 |pmc=3139576|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0021380|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other theories of life==

The chemoton is just one of several theories of life, including the [[Hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]] of [[Manfred Eigen]] and [[Peter Schuster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.11007/bf00450633|last1 = Eigen |first1 = M| last2 = Schuster |first2 =P | title = The hypercycle: a principle of natural self-organization.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1007/bf00420631|last1 = Eigen |first1 = M| last2 = Schuster |first2 =P | title = The hypercycle: a principle of natural self-organization. B: the abstract hypercycle| journal= Naturwissenschaften|volume = 65|issue = 1 |pages = 7–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

which includes the concept of [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]], the [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist) | (''M,R'') systems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1007/BF02477890 |last1 = Rosen | first1 = R.|  date = 1958 |journal = Bull.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Rosen | first1 = R.|  date = 1991| title = Life Itself: a comprehensive inquiry into the nature, origin, and fabrication of life| publisher = Columbia University Press| place=  New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], [[Autopoiesis|autopoiesis]] (or ''self-building'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Maturana |first1 = H. R.|last2 =Varela|first2 = F. |title = Autopoiesis and cognition: the realisation of the living|date=1980|publisher= D. Reidel Publishing Company| place = Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]], and the [[Autocatalytic set|autocatalytic sets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1016/0022-5193(69)90015-0|last1 = Kauffman|first1= S. A. |title = Metabolic stability and epigenesis in randomly constructed genetic nets| journal = J. Theor. Biol. |volume =22|issue=3|date=1969|pages=437–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Stuart Kauffman]], similar to an earlier proposal by [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1007/bf01733901 | title =A model for the origin of life| last = Dyson| first = F. J.|journal = J. Mol. Evol.| volume = 18| issue = 5| pages=344–350| date =1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of these (including the chemoton) found their original inspiration in Erwin Schrödinger's book ''What is Life?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Schrödinger| first1 = Erwin|title = What is Life? |publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at first they appear to have little in common with one another, largely because the authors did not communicate with one another, and none of them made any reference in their principal publications to any of the other theories. (Gánti's book&lt;ref name=gantibook /&gt; does include a mention of Rosen, but this was added as an editorial comment, and was not written by Gánti.) Nonetheless, there are more similarities than may be obvious at first sight, for example between Gánti and Rosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.05.015|title = Tibor Gánti and Robert Rosen: contrasting approaches to the same problem|last1 =Cornish-Bowden | first1 =A.|journal= J.

==Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)==

Some authors equate models of the origin of life with LUCA, the '''L'''ast '''U'''niversal '''C'''ommon '''A'''ncestor of all extant life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=34575021| doi= 10.3390/life11090872 |pmc=8467930  | title = The Way forward for the Origin of Life: Prions and Prion-Like Molecules First Hypothesis| last1 =Jheeta | first1 =S.| last2 = Chatzitheodoridis| first2 =E. | last3 = Devine| first3 =Kevin| last4 = Block| first4 = J.|journal = Life |date =2021| volume = 11|issue = 9 |pages = 872
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a serious error resulting from failure to recognize that '''L''' refers to the ''last'' common ancestor, not to the ''first'' ancestor, which is much older: a large amount of evolution occurred before the appearance of LUCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.05.023 | title = Life before LUCA |last2=Cárdenas |first2 =M L|last1=Cornish-Bowden|first1 =A| journal = J. Theor. Biol. | volume = 434 | pages=68–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill and Forterre expressed the essential point as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1017/S1473550415000282 |title = Origin of life: LUCA and extracellular membrane vesicles (EMVs)|journal= Int. J. Astrobiol.|last1 = Gill| first1 =S. |last2 = Forterre| first2 =P. |volume =15|
issue= 1 |pages=7-15| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; LUCA should not be confused with the first cell, but was the product of a long period of evolution. Being the "last" means that LUCA was preceded by a long succession of older "ancestors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''Chemotroph''' is an organism that obtains [[energy]] by the [[oxidation]] of [[electron donor]]s in their environments.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth's Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules can be [[organic molecule|organic]] ([[chemoorganotroph]]s) or [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] ([[chemolithotroph]]s).  The chemotroph designation is in contrast to [[phototroph]]s, which use photons. Chemotrophs can be either [[autotroph]]ic or [[heterotroph]]ic. Chemotrophs can be found in areas where electron donors are present in high concentration, for instance around [[hydrothermal vents]].

==Chemoautotroph==
[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[black smoker]] vent in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], providing energy and nutrients for chemotrophs]]

'''Chemoautotrophs''', in addition to deriving energy from [[chemical reaction]]s, synthesize all necessary organic compounds from [[carbon dioxide]]. Chemoautotrophs can use inorganic energy sources such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], [[iron(II) oxide|ferrous iron]], molecular [[hydrogen]], and [[ammonia]] or organic sources to produce energy.  Most chemoautotrophs are [[extremophile]]s, [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]] that live in hostile environments (such as [[deep sea vent]]s) and are the [[primary producer]]s in such [[ecosystem]]s. Chemoautotrophs generally fall into several groups: [[methanogen]]s,  [[Microbial metabolism#Sulfur oxidation|sulfur oxidizers]] and [[Sulfur-reducing bacteria|reducer]]s, [[nitrification|nitrifiers]], [[anammox]] bacteria, and [[thermoacidophile]]s. An example of one of these prokaryotes would be ''[[Sulfolobus]]''. Chemolithotrophic growth can be dramatically fast, such as ''[[Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus]]'' with a [[doubling time]] around one hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.16.5761-5766.2005 | pmid=16077123 | volume=187 | issue=16 | title=The Carbon-Concentrating Mechanism of the Hydrothermal Vent Chemolithoautotroph Thiomicrospira crunogena | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Bacteriology | pages=5761–5766 | last1 = Dobrinski | first1 = K.

The term "[[chemosynthesis]]", coined in 1897 by [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]], originally was defined as the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances in association with [[autotrophy]]—what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would include also the chemoorganoautotrophy, that is, it can be seen as a synonym of chemoautotrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kelly |first1=D. P. |last2=Wood |first2=A.

==Chemoheterotroph==
'''Chemoheterotrophs''' (or chemotrophic heterotrophs) are unable to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]] to form their own organic compounds.  Chemoheterotrophs can be chemolithoheterotrophs, utilizing inorganic electron sources such as sulfur, or, much more commonly, chemoorganoheterotrophs, utilizing organic electron sources such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Davis| first= Mackenzie Leo| title= Principles of environmental engineering and science| year= 2004| publisher=清华大学出版社| page= 133| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e0OsNiQthNQC&amp;q=chemoheterotroph&amp;pg=PA133| isbn= 978-7-302-09724-2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Lengeler| first1= Joseph W.| last2= Drews| first2= Gerhart| last3= Schlegel| first3= Hans Günter| title= Biology of the Prokaryotes| year= 1999| publisher= Georg Thieme Verlag| page= 238| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MiwpFtTdmjQC&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph+sulfur+bacteria&amp;pg=PA238| isbn= 978-3-13-108411-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Dworkin| first= Martin| title= The Prokaryotes: Ecophysiology and biochemistry| year= 2006| edition=3rd| publisher= Springer| page= 989| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uleTr2jKzJMC&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph+sulfur+bacteria&amp;pg=PA989| isbn= 978-0-387-25492-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Bergey| first1= David Hendricks| last2= Holt| first2= John G.| title= Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology| year= 1994| edition=9th| publisher= Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| page= 427| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jtMLzaa5ONcC&amp;q=chemolithotrophic+sulfur+bacteria&amp;pg=PA427| isbn= 978-0-683-00603-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most animals and fungi are examples of chemoheterotrophs, as are halophiles.

[[Iron]] is a very important [[Chemical element|element]] required by living [[organism]]s to carry out numerous [[Metabolism|metabolic]] reactions such as the formation of [[protein]]s involved in [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] reactions. Examples of these proteins include [[iron–sulfur protein]]s, [[hemoglobin]], and [[coordination complex]]es. Iron has a widespread distribution globally and is considered one of the most abundant in the Earth's crust, soil, and sediments. Iron is a trace element in [[Marine habitats|marine environments]]. Its role in the metabolism of some [[chemolithotrophs]] is probably very ancient.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

As [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] notes, the essential element present in the smallest amount (called [[limiting factor]]) is the one that determines the growth rate of a population. Iron is the most common limiting element in [[phytoplankton]] communities and has a key role in structuring and determining their abundance. It is particularly important in the [[high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions]], where the presence of [[micronutrient]]s is mandatory for the total primary production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Behrenfeld |first1=Michael J. |last2=Kolber |first2=Zbigniew S. |date=1999-02-05 |title=Widespread Iron Limitation of Phytoplankton in the South Pacific Ocean |url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.283.5403.840 |journal=Science |language=en |volume=283 |issue=5403 |pages=840–843 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5403.840 |pmid=9933166 |issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chem-seq''' is a technique that is used to map [[genome]]-wide interactions between small [[molecules]] and their [[protein]] targets in the [[chromatin]] of [[eukaryotic]] [[cell nuclei]].&lt;ref name=Ref1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anders|first=Lars|author2=Guenther, Matthew G |author3=Qi, Jun |author4=Fan, Zi Peng |author5=Marineau, Jason J |author6=Rahl, Peter B |author7=Lovén, Jakob |author8=Sigova, Alla A |author9=Smith, William B |author10=Lee, Tong Ihn |author11=Bradner, James E |author12=Young, Richard A |title=Genome-wide localization of small molecules|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=15 December 2013|volume=32|issue=1|pages=92–96|doi=10.1038/nbt.2776|pmid=24336317|pmc=4189815}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method employs chemical [[affinity capture]] coupled with massively parallel [[DNA sequencing]] to identify genomic sites where small molecules interact with their target proteins or DNA.  It was first described by Lars Anders et al. in the January, 2014 issue of "[[Nature Biotechnology]]".

==Uses of Chem-seq==
A substantial number of small-molecule [[ligands]], including therapeutic drugs, elicit their effects by binding specific proteins associated with the genome. Mapping the global interactions of these chemical entities with [[chromatin]] in a genome-wide manner could provide insights into the mechanisms by which a small molecule influences cellular functions. When combined with other chromatin analysis techniques such as [[ChIP-seq]],&lt;ref name=chip-seq&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=DS|author2=Mortazavi, A |author3=Myers, RM |author4= Wold, B |title=Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions.|journal=Science|date=Jun 8, 2007|volume=316|issue=5830|pages=1497–502|pmid=17540862 |doi=10.1126/science.1141319|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/51935/7/Johnson-SOM.revision1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chem-seq can be utilized to investigate the genome-wide effects of [[therapeutic modalities]] and to understand the effects of drugs on nuclear architecture in various biological contexts. In a broader sense, these methods will be useful to enhance our understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms through which small molecules modulate the function and activity of genome-associated proteins.&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt; Through the identification of the cellular targets of a drug, it becomes possible to gain an increased understanding of the causes of side effects and toxicity in the early stages of drug development, which should help to reduce the attrition rate in development.&lt;ref name=Ref3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Squires|first=MS|author2=Cooke, L |author3=Lock, V |author4=Qi, W |author5=Lewis, EJ |author6=Thompson, NT |author7=Lyons, JF |author8= Mahadevan, D |title=AT7519, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, exerts its effects by transcriptional inhibition in leukemia cell lines and patient samples.|journal=Molecular Cancer Therapeutics|date=Apr 2010|volume=9|issue=4|pages=920–8|pmid=20354122 |doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1071|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workflow of Chem-seq==
[[File:Chem-seq Workflow.png|thumb|right|Chem-seq Workflow]]
Chem-seq relies on the ability to create a [[Biotinylation|biotinylated]] version of a small molecule of interest to allow for downstream [[affinity capture]]. Chem-seq can be carried out either ''[[In vitro]]'' or ''[[In vivo]]'', although the results from each have proven to be highly similar.&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt;

'''''In vivo'' Chem-seq'''

During ''In vivo'' Chem-seq,&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt; cultured cells in medium are treated simultaneously with either a biotinylated version of the small molecule under study or [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] (as a control) and 1% formaldehyde for the crosslinking of DNA, proteins and small molecules. DNA is then extracted from the cells, [[sonicated]] and enriched for regions containing the biotinylated molecule of interest by incubation with [[streptavidin]] magnetic beads, which have a very high affinity for biotin. The enriched DNA fraction is then purified, eluted from the beads and subjected to next generation sequencing. Genomic regions enriched in the Chem-seq library relative to the control are associated with the small molecule under study.

'''''In vitro'' Chem-seq'''

''In vitro'' Chem-seq&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt;  begins with the crosslinking of cultured cells in medium with 0.5% formaldehyde. Cell nuclei are then harvested from the cells and their DNA is extracted. This extract is sonicated before being incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads that are bound to a biotinylated form of our compound of interest. This provides an opportunity for the small molecule of interest to interact with its target genomic regions. These genomic regions are then isolated using a magnet and subjected to next generation sequencing and analysis to determine regions enriched for our small molecule of interest.

==Sensitivity==

Chem-seq was tested on three classes of drugs using MM1.S [[multiple myeloma]] cells to:&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt;

1) Investigate the genome-wide binding of the [[bromodomain]] inhibitor [[JQ1]] to the BET bromodomain family members [[BRD2]], [[BRD3]] and [[BRD4]]

2) Map the genomic binding sites of [[AT7519]], an inhibitor of the cyclin dependent kinase [[CDK9]], and

3) Study how the DNA [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] agent [[psoralen]] interacts with genomic DNA in vivo.

In the first two trials, Chem-seq signals occurred at genomic sites occupied by the drugs' corresponding target proteins and were concordant with ChIP-seq results. However, bio-AT7519 produced weaker Chem-seq signals compared to those observed for bio-JQ1. There was also a substantial number of loci that were not co-occupied by bio-AT7519 and its target CDK9 which might be attributed to the weaker signal obtained for bio-AT7519 or because AT7519 can bind and inhibit other cyclin-dependent kinase like cdks 1, 2, 4, 5.&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ref3 /&gt; In a third experiment, Chem-seq was efficient in mapping genomic binding sites of the DNA intercalating agent [[psoralen]] and showed that bio-psoralen preferentially binds to the transcription start site of active genes.

==Advantages and Limitations==

''Advantages''

Chem-seq is the first method that provides researchers with a way of determining the location of small molecules throughout the genome. It can be used in conjunction with ChIP-seq to cross reference the location of certain drugs with [[DNA binding protein]]s, like [[transcription factor]]s, to discover novel interactions and aid in characterizing the molecular mechanisms through which small molecules affect the genome.

Because it uses next generation sequencing to determine small molecule binding sites, Chem-seq has a very high sensitivity and is compatible with other next generation sequencing based methods.

Previously, another similar technique known as chromatin affinity-precipitation (ChAP) assay was used to map the sites of interaction of metabolic compounds in the yeast genome,&lt;ref name=Yeast&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tung|first=SY|author2=Hong, JY |author3=Walz, T |author4=Moazed, D |author5= Liou, GG |title=Chromatin affinity-precipitation using a small metabolic molecule: its application to analysis of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose.|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|date=Feb 2012|volume=69|issue=4|pages=641–50|pmid=21796450 |doi=10.1007/s00018-011-0771-x |pmc=3266462}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Chem-seq is the first method to assess the genome-wide localization of small molecules in mammalian cells.

''Limitations''

For Chem-seq to be feasible, the small molecule under study must be amenable to biotinylation without disruption of its natural binding properties. This is simply not possible with certain small molecules and even when it is, the process can require expertise in organic chemistry. Once synthesized, the binding properties of the biotinylated compound must be tested. To date, this has been accomplished by comparing the binding kinetics of the biotinylated and unmodified compounds,&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt; a process that requires prior knowledge of the proteins that the compound binds.

The locations of Bio-JQ1 throughout the genome, as determined using Chem-seq, are almost identical to the ChIP-seq derived locations of the JQ1’s known target protein, BRD4.&lt;ref name=Ref1 /&gt; Although this may be viewed as a testament to the accuracy of the method it also highlights redundancies between the two techniques, especially when target proteins are previously known.

'''ChIP-sequencing''', also known as '''ChIP-seq''', is a method used to analyze [[protein]] interactions with [[DNA]]. ChIP-seq combines [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) with [[Massively parallel signature sequencing|massively parallel]] [[DNA sequencing]] to identify the [[binding site]]s of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to map global binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Previously, [[ChIP-on-chip]] was the most common technique utilized to study these protein–DNA relations.

==Uses==
ChIP-seq is primarily used to determine how [[transcription factors]] and other chromatin-associated proteins influence [[phenotype]]-affecting mechanisms. Determining how proteins interact with DNA to regulate [[gene expression]] is essential for fully understanding many biological processes and disease states. This [[epigenetic]] information is complementary to [[genotype]] and expression analysis. ChIP-seq technology is currently seen primarily as an alternative to [[ChIP-chip]] which requires a [[protein microarray|hybridization array]]. This introduces some bias, as an array is restricted to a fixed number of probes. Sequencing, by contrast, is thought to have less bias, although the sequencing bias of different sequencing technologies is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Muhammad|first1=Isiaka Ibrahim|last2=Kong|first2=Sze Ling|last3=Akmar Abdullah|first3=Siti Nor|last4=Munusamy|first4=Umaiyal|date=2019-12-25|title=RNA-seq and ChIP-seq as Complementary Approaches for Comprehension of Plant Transcriptional Regulatory Mechanism|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=21|issue=1|page=167|doi=10.3390/ijms21010167|issn=1422-0067|pmc=6981605|pmid=31881735|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific DNA sites in direct physical interaction with transcription factors and other proteins can be isolated by [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]]. ChIP produces a library of target DNA sites bound to a protein of interest. Massively parallel sequence analyses are used in conjunction with whole-genome sequence databases to analyze the interaction pattern of any protein with DNA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson DS, Mortazavi A, Myers RM, Wold B | title = Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions | journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5830 | pages = 1497–502 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17540862 | doi = 10.1126/science.1141319 | url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/51935/7/Johnson-SOM.revision1.pdf | bibcode = 2007Sci...316.1497J | s2cid = 519841 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the pattern of any epigenetic [[chromatin]] modifications. This can be applied to the set of ChIP-able proteins and modifications, such as transcription factors, [[polymerase]]s and [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional machinery]], [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural proteins]], [[protein modification]]s, and [[DNA modification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Whole-Genome Chromatin IP Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) | url = http://www.illumina.com/Documents/products/datasheets/datasheet_chip_sequence.pdf | publisher = Illumina, Inc. | date = 26 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to the dependence on specific antibodies, different methods have been developed to find the superset of all [[nucleosome]]-depleted or nucleosome-disrupted active regulatory regions in the genome, like [[DNase-Seq]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Song|first1=Lingyun|last2=Crawford|first2=Gregory E.|date=February 2010|title=DNase-seq: a high-resolution technique for mapping active gene regulatory elements across the genome from mammalian cells|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Protocols|volume=2010|issue=2|pages=pdb.prot5384|doi=10.1101/pdb.prot5384|issn=1559-6095|pmc=3627383|pmid=20150147}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FAIRE-Seq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giresi|first1=Paul G.|last2=Kim|first2=Jonghwan|last3=McDaniell|first3=Ryan M.|last4=Iyer|first4=Vishwanath R.|last5=Lieb|first5=Jason D.|date=June 2007|title=FAIRE (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) isolates active regulatory elements from human chromatin|journal=Genome Research|volume=17|issue=6|pages=877–885|doi=10.1101/gr.5533506|issn=1088-9051|pmc=1891346|pmid=17179217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Vibhor|last2=Muratani|first2=Masafumi|last3=Rayan|first3=Nirmala Arul|last4=Kraus|first4=Petra|last5=Lufkin|first5=Thomas|last6=Ng|first6=Huck Hui|last7=Prabhakar|first7=Shyam|date=July 2013|title=Uniform, optimal signal processing of mapped deep-sequencing data|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=31|issue=7|pages=615–622|doi=10.1038/nbt.2596|pmid=23770639|s2cid=32510475|issn=1087-0156|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workflow of ChIP-sequencing==
[[Image:Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing.svg|thumb|right|300px|ChIP-sequencing workflow]]

===ChIP===
[[ChIP]] is a powerful method to selectively enrich for DNA sequences bound by a particular protein in living [[cell (biology)|cells]]. However, the widespread use of this method has been limited by the lack of a sufficiently robust method to identify all of the enriched DNA sequences. The ChIP wet lab protocol contains ChIP and hybridization. There are essentially five parts to the ChIP protocol&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abcam.com/epigenetics/studying-epigenetics-using-chip|title=ChIP guide: epigenetics applications {{!}} Abcam|website=www.abcam.com|access-date=2020-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aid in better understanding the overall process of ChIP. In order to carry out the ChIP, the first step is [[Crosslinking of DNA|cross-linking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TH, Dekker J | title = Formaldehyde Cross-Linking | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = pdb.prot082594 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29610357 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot082594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using formaldehyde and large batches of the DNA in order to obtain a useful amount. The cross-links are made between the protein and DNA, but also between RNA and other proteins. The second step is the process of chromatin fragmentation which breaks up the chromatin in order to get high quality DNA pieces for ChIP analysis in the end. These fragments should be cut to become under 500 base pairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TH, Dekker J | title = Preparation of Cross-Linked Chromatin for ChIP | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = pdb.prot082602 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29610358 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot082602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each to have the best outcome for genome mapping. The third step is called chromatin immunoprecipitation,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is what ChIP is short for. The ChIP process enhances specific crosslinked DNA-protein complexes using an [[antibody]] against the protein of interest followed by incubation and centrifugation to obtain the immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation step also allows for the removal of non-specific binding sites. The fourth step is DNA recovery and purification,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; taking place by the reversed effect on the cross-link between DNA and protein to separate them and cleaning DNA with an extraction. The fifth and final step is the analyzation step of the ChIP protocol by the process of [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]], [[ChIP-on-chip]] (hybrid array) or ChIP sequencing. [[Oligonucleotide]] adaptors are then added to the small stretches of DNA that were bound to the protein of interest to enable massively parallel sequencing. Through the analysis, the sequences can then be identified and interpreted by the gene or region to where the protein was bound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Sequencing===
After size selection, all the resulting ChIP-DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously using a genome sequencer. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, meaning that features can be located precisely on the chromosomes. ChIP-chip, by contrast, requires large sets of [[tiling array]]s for lower resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Peter J.|date=October 2009|title=ChIP-seq: advantages and challenges of a maturing technology|journal=Nature Reviews. Genetics|volume=10|issue=10|pages=669–680|doi=10.1038/nrg2641|issn=1471-0064|pmc=3191340|pmid=19736561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|new sequencing methods]] used in this sequencing step. Some technologies that analyze the sequences can use [[cluster amplification]] of adapter-ligated ChIP DNA fragments on a solid [[flow cell]] substrate to create clusters of approximately 1000 clonal copies each. The resulting high density array of template clusters on the flow cell surface is sequenced by a genome analyzing program. Each template cluster undergoes [[Pyrosequencing|sequencing-by-synthesis]] in parallel using novel fluorescently labelled reversible terminator nucleotides. Templates are sequenced base-by-base during each read. Then, the data collection and analysis software aligns sample sequences to a known genomic sequence to identify the ChIP-DNA fragments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Quality control ==
ChIP-seq offers us a fast analysis, however, a quality control must be performed to make sure that the results obtained are reliable:

* '''Non-redundant fraction''': low-complexity regions should be removed as they are not informative and may interfere with mapping in the reference genome.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Yiwen|last2=Negre|first2=Nicolas|last3=Li|first3=Qunhua|last4=Mieczkowska|first4=Joanna O.|last5=Slattery|first5=Matthew|last6=Liu|first6=Tao|last7=Zhang|first7=Yong|last8=Kim|first8=Tae-Kyung|last9=He|first9=Housheng Hansen|last10=Zieba|first10=Jennifer|last11=Ruan|first11=Yijun|date=June 2012|title=Systematic evaluation of factors influencing ChIP-seq fidelity|journal=Nature Methods|volume=9|issue=6|pages=609–614|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1985|issn=1548-7105|pmc=3477507|pmid=22522655}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fragments in peaks:''' ratio of reads that are located in peaks over reads that are located where there isn't a peak.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Sensitivity==
Sensitivity of this technology depends on the depth of the sequencing run (i.e. the number of mapped sequence tags), the size of the genome and the distribution of the target factor.
The sequencing depth is directly correlated with cost. If abundant binders in large genomes have to be mapped with high sensitivity, costs are high as an enormously high number of sequence tags will be required. This is in contrast to ChIP-chip in which the costs are not correlated with sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jung|first1=Youngsook L.|last2=Luquette|first2=Lovelace J.|last3=Ho|first3=Joshua W.

Unlike [[microarray]]-based ChIP methods, the precision of the ChIP-seq assay is not limited by the spacing of predetermined probes. By integrating a large number of short reads, highly precise binding site localization is obtained. Compared to ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq data can be used to locate the binding site within few tens of base pairs of the actual protein binding site.

'''STAT1 DNA association:''' ChIP-seq was used to study STAT1 targets in [[HeLa]] S3 cells which are clones of the HeLa line that are used for analysis of cell populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biocompare.com/12841-HeLa-Cells/871880-HeLa-S3/#reviews|title=HeLa S3 from ATCC {{!}} Biocompare.com|website=www.biocompare.com|access-date=2020-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of ChIP-seq was then compared to the alternative protein–DNA interaction methods of ChIP-PCR and ChIP-chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson G, Hirst M, Bainbridge M, Bilenky M, Zhao Y, Zeng T, Euskirchen G, Bernier B, Varhol R, Delaney A, Thiessen N, Griffith OL, He A, Marra M, Snyder M, Jones S | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-wide profiles of STAT1 DNA association using chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 651–7 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17558387 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth1068 | s2cid = 28531263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nucleosome Architecture of Promoters:''' Using ChIP-seq, it was determined that Yeast genes seem to have a minimal nucleosome-free promoter region of 150bp in which RNA polymerase can initiate transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmid CD, Bucher P | title = ChIP-Seq data reveal nucleosome architecture of human promoters | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 831–2; author reply 832–3 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18045524 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.017 | s2cid = 29234049 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transcription factor conservation:''' ChIP-seq was used to compare conservation of TFs in the forebrain and heart tissue in embryonic mice. The authors identified and validated the heart functionality of [[Enhancer (genetics)|transcription enhancers]], and determined that transcription enhancers for the heart are less conserved than those for the forebrain during the same developmental stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blow MJ, McCulley DJ, Li Z, Zhang T, Akiyama JA, Holt A, Plajzer-Frick I, Shoukry M, Wright C, Chen F, Afzal V, Bristow J, Ren B, Black BL, Rubin EM, Visel A, Pennacchio LA | display-authors = 6 | title = ChIP-Seq identification of weakly conserved heart enhancers | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 42 | issue = 9 | pages = 806–10 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20729851 | pmc = 3138496 | doi = 10.1038/ng.650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genome-wide ChIP-seq:''' ChIP-sequencing was completed on the worm ''C. elegans'' to explore genome-wide binding sites of 22 transcription factors. Up to 20% of the annotated candidate genes were assigned to transcription factors. Several transcription factors were assigned to non-coding RNA regions and may be subject to developmental or environmental variables. The functions of some of the transcription factors were also identified. Some of the transcription factors regulate genes that control other transcription factors. These genes are not regulated by other factors. Most transcription factors serve as both targets and regulators of other factors, demonstrating a network of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niu W, Lu ZJ, Zhong M, Sarov M, Murray JI, Brdlik CM, Janette J, Chen C, Alves P, Preston E, Slightham C, Jiang L, Hyman AA, Kim SK, Waterston RH, Gerstein M, Snyder M, Reinke V | display-authors = 6 | title = Diverse transcription factor binding features revealed by genome-wide ChIP-seq in C. elegans | journal = Genome Research | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–54 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21177963 | pmc = 3032928 | doi = 10.1101/gr.114587.110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inferring regulatory network:''' ChIP-seq signal of [[Histone modification]] were shown to  be more correlated with transcription factor motifs at promoters in comparison to RNA level.&lt;ref name="Kumar_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar V, Muratani M, Rayan NA, Kraus P, Lufkin T, Ng HH, Prabhakar S | title = Uniform, optimal signal processing of mapped deep-sequencing data | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 7 | pages = 615–22 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23770639 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2596 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence author proposed that using histone modification ChIP-seq would provide more reliable inference of gene-regulatory networks in comparison to other methods based on expression.

ChIP-seq offers an alternative to ChIP-chip. STAT1 experimental ChIP-seq data have a high degree of similarity to results obtained by ChIP-chip for the same type of experiment, with greater than 64% of peaks in shared genomic regions. Because the data are sequence reads, ChIP-seq offers a rapid analysis pipeline as long as a high-quality genome sequence is available for read mapping and the genome doesn't have repetitive content that confuses the mapping process. ChIP-seq also has the potential to detect mutations in binding-site sequences, which may directly support any observed changes in protein binding and gene regulation.

==Computational analysis==
As with many high-throughput sequencing approaches, ChIP-seq generates extremely large data sets, for which appropriate computational analysis methods are required. To predict DNA-binding sites from ChIP-seq read count data, [[peak calling]] methods have been developed. One of the most popular methods{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} is MACS which empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Liu T, Meyer CA, Eeckhoute J, Johnson DS, Bernstein BE, Nusbaum C, Myers RM, Brown M, Li W, Liu XS | display-authors = 6 | title = Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = R137 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18798982 | pmc = 2592715 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MACS is optimized for higher resolution peaks, while another popular algorithm, SICER is programmed to call for broader peaks, spanning over kilobases to megabases in order to search for broader chromatin domains. SICER is more useful for histone marks spanning gene bodies. A mathematical more rigorous method BCP (Bayesian Change Point) can be used for both sharp and broad peaks with faster computational speed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xing H, Mo Y, Liao W, Zhang MQ | title = Genome-wide localization of protein-DNA binding and histone modification by a Bayesian change-point method with ChIP-seq data.| journal = PLOS Comput Biol | volume =  8| issue = 7 | pages = e1002613 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22844240 | pmc = 5429005| doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002613 | bibcode = 2012PLSCB...8E2613X}}&lt;/ref&gt; see benchmark comparison of ChIP-seq peak-calling tools by Thomas ''et al.'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas R, Thomas S, Holloway AK, Pollard KS | title = Features that define the best ChIP-seq peak calling algorithms | journal = Brief Bioinform | volume =  18| issue = 3 | pages = 441–450 | year = 2017 | pmid = 27169896 | pmc = 5429005 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbw035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relevant computational problem is differential peak calling, which identifies significant differences in two ChIP-seq signals from distinct biological conditions. Differential peak callers segment two ChIP-seq signals and identify differential peaks using [[Hidden Markov Model]]s. Examples for two-stage differential peak callers are ChIPDiff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu H, Wei CL, Lin F, Sung WK | title = An HMM approach to genome-wide identification of differential histone modification sites from ChIP-seq data | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 24 | issue = 20 | pages = 2344–9 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18667444 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn402 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ODIN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allhoff M, Seré K, Chauvistré H, Lin Q, Zenke M, Costa IG | title = Detecting differential peaks in ChIP-seq signals with ODIN | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 30 | issue = 24 | pages = 3467–75 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25371479 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce spurious sites from ChIP-seq, multiple experimental controls can be used to detect binding sites from an IP experiment. Bay2Ctrls adopts a Bayesian model to integrate the DNA input control for the IP, the mock IP and its corresponding DNA input control to predict binding sites from the IP.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Jinrui|last2=Kudron|first2=Michelle M|last3=Victorsen|first3=Alec|last4=Gao|first4=Jiahao|last5=Ammouri|first5=Haneen N|last6=Navarro|first6=Fabio C P|last7=Gevirtzman|first7=Louis|last8=Waterston|first8=Robert H|last9=White|first9=Kevin P|last10=Reinke|first10=Valerie|last11=Gerstein|first11=Mark|date=2020-12-21|title=To mock or not: a comprehensive comparison of mock IP and DNA input for ChIP-seq|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=49|issue=3|language=en|pages=gkaa1155|doi=10.1093/nar/gkaa1155|pmid=33347581|pmc=7897498|issn=0305-1048|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is particularly effective for complex samples such as whole model organisms. In addition, the analysis indicates that for complex samples mock IP controls substantially outperform DNA input controls probably due to the active genomes of the samples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[chemical analysis]], '''chromatography''' is a [[laboratory technique]] for the [[Separation process|separation]] of a [[mixture]] into its components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or liquid) called the ''mobile phase'', which carries it through a system (a column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material called the ''stationary phase'' is fixed. Because the different constituents of the mixture tend to have different affinities for the stationary phase and are retained for different lengths of time depending on their interactions with its surface sites, the constituents travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's [[partition coefficient]] result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McMurry |first1=John | name-list-style = vanc |title=Organic chemistry: with biological applications|url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsorga00mcmu|url-access=limited|date=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=9780495391470|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsorga00mcmu/page/n412 395]|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromatography may be preparative or analytical.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
Chromatography, pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|r|əʊ|m|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|g|r|ə|f|i}}, is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] χρῶμα ''chroma'', which means "[[color]]", and γράφειν ''graphein'', which means "to write". The combination of these two terms was directly inherited from the invention of the technique first used to separate pigments.&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite OEtymD|chromatography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of chromatography}}

Chromatography was first devised in Russia by the Italian-born scientist [[Mikhail Tsvet]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="75Years"&gt;{{cite book|veditors = Ettre LS, Zlatkis A|title=75 Years of Chromatography: A Historical Dialogue|date=2011-08-26|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-085817-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the technique and coined the term ''chromatography'' in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant [[pigment]]s such as [[chlorophyll]], [[carotene]]s, and [[xanthophyll]]s. Since these components separate in bands of different colors (green, orange, and yellow, respectively) they directly inspired the name of the technique. New types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many [[separation processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Ettre LS, Sakodynskii KI |title=M. S. Tswett and the discovery of chromatography II: Completion of the development of chromatography (1903–1910)|journal=Chromatographia|date=March 1993|volume=35|issue=5–6|pages=329–338|doi=10.1007/BF02277520|s2cid=97052560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromatography technique developed substantially as a result of the work of [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]] during the 1940s and 1950s, for which they won the 1952 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1952|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1952/|website=nobelprize.org|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods: [[paper chromatography]], [[gas chromatography]], and what would become known as [[high-performance liquid chromatography]]. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.

Chromatography is based on the concept of partition coefficient. Any solute partitions between two immiscible solvents. When we make one solvent immobile (by adsorption on a solid support matrix) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography. If the matrix support, or stationary phase, is polar (e.g. paper, silica etc.) it is forward phase chromatography, and if it is non-polar (C-18) it is reverse phase.

==Techniques by chromatographic bed shape==

===Column chromatography===
{{details|Column chromatography}}
[[File:Column chromatography sequence.png]]

Column chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365040819|title=Nomenclature for chromatography (IUPAC Recommendations 1993)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=65|issue=4|pages=819–872|year=1993| vauthors = Ettre LS |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Manish T |title=How does column chromatography work?|url=http://brightmags.com/how-does-chromatography-work/|publisher=BrightMags|access-date=7 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421085642/http://brightmags.com/how-does-chromatography-work/|archive-date=21 April 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1978, W. Clark Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called ''flash column chromatography'' (flash).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Still WC, Kahn M, Mitra A | year = 1978 | title = Rapid chromatographic technique for preparative separations with moderate resolution | journal = [[J. Org. Chem.]] | volume = 43 | issue = 14 | pages = 2923–2925 | doi = 10.1021/jo00408a041 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.476.6501 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Harwood LM, Moody CJ | title = Experimental organic chemistry: Principles and Practice | edition = Illustrated | pages = [https://archive.org/details/experimentalorga00harw/page/180 180–185] | isbn = 978-0-632-02017-1 | date = 1989 | publisher = WileyBlackwell | url = https://archive.org/details/experimentalorga00harw/page/180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.

In [[expanded bed adsorption]], a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.

[[Phosphocellulose]] chromatography utilizes the binding affinity of many DNA-binding proteins for phosphocellulose.  The stronger a protein's interaction with DNA, the higher the salt concentration needed to elute that protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bourgeois S, Pfahl M| chapter = Repressors | veditors = Anfinsen CB, Edsall JT, Richards FM |title=Advances in Protein Chemistry|isbn=978-0-12-034230-3 |year=1976|pages=6–7 | volume = 30 | publisher = Academic Press | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60478-7 | pmid = 779429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planar chromatography===
''Planar chromatography'' is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed ([[paper chromatography]]) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate ([[thin-layer chromatography]]). Different [[chemical compound|compounds]] in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase. The specific [[Retention factor]] (R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.

====Paper chromatography====
[[File:Paper chromatography in progress.jpg|thumb|Paper chromatography in progress]]
[[File:Chromatography tank.png|thumb|Paper chromatography]]
{{details|Paper chromatography}}
Paper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] onto a strip of ''[[chromatography paper]]''. The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of [[solvent]] and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of [[cellulose]], a [[Chemical polarity|polar substance]], and the compounds within the mixture travel further if they are less polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.

====Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) ====
{{details|Thin-layer chromatography}}
[[File:TLC black ink.jpg|thumb|Thin layer chromatography]]
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely employed laboratory technique used to separate different biochemicals on the basis of their relative attractions to the stationary and mobile phases. It is similar to [[paper chromatography]]. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of [[adsorbent]] like [[silica gel]], [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]], or [[cellulose]] on a flat, inert [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. TLC is very versatile; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer, making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Thin-Layer Chromatography|last=Bernard.|first=Fried | name-list-style = vanc |date=2003|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|isbn=978-0824748661|oclc=437068122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a new layer. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, better quantitative analysis, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better [[resolution (chromatography)|resolution]] and faster separation that utilizes less solvent, [[HPTLC|high-performance TLC]] can be used. An older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel (separation of was a separate step).

==Displacement chromatography==
The basic principle of [[displacement chromatography]] is:
A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) competes effectively for binding sites, and thus displaces all molecules with lesser affinities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html Displacement Chromatography 101] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915113736/http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html |date=15 September 2008 }}. Sachem, Inc. Austin, TX 78737&lt;/ref&gt;
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than "peaks". Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.

==Techniques by physical state of mobile phase==
===Gas chromatography===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Biodiesel]] --&gt;
{{details|Gas chromatography}}
Gas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as gas-liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a gas. Gas chromatographic separation is always carried out in a column, which is typically "packed" or "capillary".  Packed columns are the routine work horses of gas chromatography, being cheaper and easier to use and often giving adequate performance.   Capillary columns generally give far superior resolution and although more expensive are becoming widely used, especially for complex mixtures. Further, capillary columns can be split into three classes: porous layer open tubular (PLOT), wall-coated open tubular (WCOT) and support-coated open tubular (SCOT) columns. PLOT columns are unique in a way that the stationary phase is adsorbed to the column walls, while WCOT columns have a stationary phase that is chemically bonded to the walls. SCOT columns are in a way the combination of the two types mentioned in a way that they have support particles adhered to column walls, but those particles have liquid phase chemically bonded onto them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rahman |first1=M. |last2=El-Aty |first2=A.M.A. |last3=Choi |first3=J.-H. |last4=Shin |first4=H.-C. |last5=Shin |first5=S.-C. |last6=Shim |first6=J.-H. |date=November 2015 |title= Analytical Separation Science |pages=823–834 |chapter=Chapter 3 Basic Overview on Gas Chromatography Columns |isbn=9783527333745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of column are made from non-adsorbent and chemically inert materials. Stainless steel and glass are the usual materials for packed columns and quartz or fused silica for capillary columns.

Gas chromatography is based on a [[partition equilibrium]] of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 – 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in [[analytical chemistry]]; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in [[biochemistry]], it is well suited for use in the [[petrochemical]], [[environmental monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], and [[Chemical industry|industrial chemical]] fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.

===Liquid chromatography===
[[File:Preparative HPLC.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Preparative HPLC apparatus]]
Liquid chromatography (LC) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. It can be carried out either in a column or a plane. Present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC).

In HPLC the sample is forced by a liquid at high pressure (the mobile phase) through a column that is packed with a stationary phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a [[Monolithic HPLC column|porous monolithic layer]], or a porous membrane. Monoliths are "sponge-like chromatographic media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=González-González|first1=Mirna|title=Chapter 5 - Recent advances in antibody-based monolith chromatography for therapeutic applications|date=2020-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081030196000059|work=Approaches to the Purification, Analysis and Characterization of Antibody-Based Therapeutics|pages=105–116|editor-last=Matte|editor-first=Allan|publisher=Elsevier|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-103019-6.00005-9|isbn=978-0-08-103019-6|access-date=2022-01-31|last2=Mayolo-Deloisa|first2=Karla|last3=Rito-Palomares|first3=Marco|s2cid=226450210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are made up of an unending block of organic or inorganic parts. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Methods in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g., toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the stationary phase) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g., water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 ([[octadecylsilyl]]) as the stationary phase) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC).

Specific techniques under this broad heading are listed below.

==Affinity chromatography==
{{details|Affinity chromatography}}
Affinity chromatography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wilchek M, Chaiken I | title = Affinity Chromatography | chapter = An overview of affinity chromatography | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 147 | pages = 1–6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10857080 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60327-261-2_1 | isbn = 978-1-60327-261-2 | veditors = Bailon P, Ehrlich GK, Fung WJ, Berthold W | publisher = Humana Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules.

These [[fusion protein]]s are labeled with compounds such as [[His-tag]]s, [[biotin]] or [[antigen]]s, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.

Affinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal (Zn, Cu, Fe, etc.).  Columns are often manually prepared. Traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules.

However, liquid chromatography techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatography properties.  Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Singh NK, DSouza RN, Bibi NS, Fernández-Lahore M | title = Affinity Chromatography | chapter = Direct Capture of His6-Tagged Proteins Using Megaporous Cryogels Developed for Metal-Ion Affinity Chromatography | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 1286 | pages = 201–12 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25749956 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4939-2447-9_16 | isbn = 978-1-4939-2447-9 | veditors = Reichelt S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaberc-Porekar V, Menart V | title = Perspectives of immobilized-metal affinity chromatography | journal = Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods | volume = 49 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 335–60 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11694288 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-022X(01)00207-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; is useful to separate the aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal.

===Supercritical fluid chromatography===
{{main|Supercritical fluid chromatography}}
Supercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure.

==Techniques by separation mechanism==

===Ion exchange chromatography===
{{details|Ion exchange chromatography}}
Ion exchange chromatography (usually referred to as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including [[anion]]s, [[cation]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an [[ion-exchange resin]] that carries charged [[functional group]]s that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There are two types of ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the exchangeable ion is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the exchangeable ion is an anion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander J | name-list-style = vanc |year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-47131-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using [[fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]].

===Size-exclusion chromatography===
{{details|Size-exclusion chromatography}}
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also known as ''gel permeation chromatography'' (GPC) or ''gel filtration chromatography'' and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume).
Smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore, molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, "polishing" step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins, especially since it can be carried out under native solution conditions.

===Expanded bed adsorption chromatographic separation===
{{details|Expanded bed adsorption}}
An expanded bed chromatographic adsorption (EBA) column for a biochemical separation process comprises a pressure equalization liquid distributor having a self-cleaning function below a porous blocking sieve plate at the bottom of the expanded bed, an upper part nozzle assembly having a backflush cleaning function at the top of the expanded bed, a better distribution of the feedstock liquor added into the expanded bed ensuring that the fluid passed through the expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow. The expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow. The expanded bed chromatographic separation column has advantages of increasing the separation efficiency of the expanded bed.

Expanded-bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography is a convenient and effective technique for the capture of proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends on the characteristics of the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.

==Special techniques==

===Reversed-phase chromatography===
{{main|Reversed-phase chromatography}}
Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) is any liquid chromatography procedure in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase. Hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase. Hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend to elute first. Separating columns typically comprise a C8 or C18 carbon-chain bonded to a silica particle substrate.

===Hydrophobic interaction chromatography===

Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) is a purification and analytical technique that separates analytes, such as proteins, based on hydrophobic interactions between that analyte and the chromatographic matrix. It can provide a non-denaturing orthogonal approach to reversed phase separation, preserving native structures and potentially protein activity.  In hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the matrix material is lightly substituted with hydrophobic groups. These groups can range from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, octyl, or phenyl groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ninfa AJ, Ballou DP, Benore M | title = Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology | location = Hoboken, NJ | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At high salt concentrations, non-polar sidechains on the surface on proteins "interact" with the hydrophobic groups; that is, both types of groups are excluded by the polar solvent (hydrophobic effects are augmented by increased ionic strength). Thus, the sample is applied to the column in a buffer which is highly polar, which drives an association of hydrophobic patches on the analyte with the stationary phase. The eluent is typically an aqueous buffer with decreasing salt concentrations, increasing concentrations of detergent (which disrupts hydrophobic interactions), or changes in pH.  Of critical importance is the type of salt used, with more [[kosmotropic]] salts as defined by the [[Hofmeister series]] providing the most water structuring around the molecule and resulting hydrophobic pressure.  Ammonium sulfate is frequently used for this purpose.  The addition of organic solvents or other less polar constituents may assist in improving resolution. 

In general, Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) is advantageous if the sample is sensitive to pH change or harsh solvents typically used in other types of chromatography but not high salt concentrations. Commonly, it is the amount of salt in the buffer which is varied. In 2012, Müller and Franzreb described the effects of temperature on HIC using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with four different types of hydrophobic resin. The study altered temperature as to effect the binding affinity of BSA onto the matrix. It was concluded that cycling temperature from 50 to 10 degrees would not be adequate to effectively wash all BSA from the matrix but could be very effective if the column would only be used a few times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Müller TK, Franzreb M | title = Suitability of commercial hydrophobic interaction sorbents for temperature-controlled protein liquid chromatography under low salt conditions | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 1260 | pages = 88–96 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22954746 | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2012.08.052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using temperature to effect change allows labs to cut costs on buying salt and saves money.

If high salt concentrations along with temperature fluctuations want to be avoided you can use a more hydrophobic to compete with your sample to elute it. [source] This so-called salt independent method of HIC showed a direct isolation of Human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from serum with satisfactory yield and used Beta-cyclodextrin as a competitor to displace IgG from the matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ren J, Yao P, Chen J, Jia L | title = Salt-independent hydrophobic displacement chromatography for antibody purification using cyclodextrin as supermolecular displacer | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 1369 | pages = 98–104 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25441076 | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2014.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This largely opens up the possibility of using HIC with samples which are salt sensitive as we know high salt concentrations precipitate proteins.

=== Hydrodynamic chromatography ===
Hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) is derived from the observed phenomenon that large droplets move faster than small ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song H, Tice JD, Ismagilov RF | title = A microfluidic system for controlling reaction networks in time | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 768–72 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12596195 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200390203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column, this happens because the [[center of mass]] of larger droplets is prevented from being as close to the sides of the column as smaller droplets because of their larger overall size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Small|first1=Hamish|last2=Langhorst|first2=Martin A. | name-list-style = vanc |date=1982-07-01|title=Hydrodynamic Chromatography|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=54|issue=8|pages=892A–898A|doi=10.1021/ac00245a724|issn=0003-2700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger droplets will elute first from the middle of the column while smaller droplets stick to the sides of the column and elute last. This form of chromatography is useful for separating analytes by [[molar mass]], size, shape, and structure when used in conjunction with [[Scattering|light scattering]] detectors, [[viscometer]]s, and [[refractometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brewer AK, Striegel AM | title = Characterizing string-of-pearls colloidal silica by multidetector hydrodynamic chromatography and comparison to multidetector size-exclusion chromatography, off-line multiangle static light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 83 | issue = 8 | pages = 3068–75 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21428298 | doi = 10.1021/ac103314c }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main types of HDC are open tube and [[Packed bed|packed column]].

HDC shares the same order of elution as [[Size-exclusion chromatography|Size Exclusion Chromatography]] (SEC) but the two processes still vary in many ways.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In a study comparing the two types of separation, Isenberg, Brewer, Côté, and Striegel use both methods for [[polysaccharide]] characterization and conclude that HDC coupled with [[multiangle light scattering]] (MALS) achieves more accurate [[molar mass distribution]] when compared to off-line MALS than SEC in significantly less time.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Isenberg SL, Brewer AK, Côté GL, Striegel AM | title = Hydrodynamic versus size exclusion chromatography characterization of alternan and comparison to off-line MALS | journal = Biomacromolecules | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 2505–11 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20690593 | doi = 10.1021/bm100687b }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to SEC being a more destructive technique because of the pores in the column degrading the analyte during separation, which tends to impact the mass distribution.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; However, the main disadvantage of HDC is low [[Resolution (chromatography)|resolution]] of analyte peaks, which makes SEC a more viable option when used with chemicals that are not easily degradable and where rapid elution is not important.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Striegel AM, Brewer AK | title = Hydrodynamic chromatography | journal = Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–34 | date = 2012-07-19 | pmid = 22708902 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-anchem-062011-143107 | bibcode = 2012ARAC....5...15S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDC plays an especially important role in the field of [[microfluidics]]. The first successful apparatus for HDC-on-a-chip system was proposed by Chmela, et al. in 2002.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chmela E, Tijssen R, Blom MT, Gardeniers HJ, van den Berg A | title = A chip system for size separation of macromolecules and particles by hydrodynamic chromatography | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 74 | issue = 14 | pages = 3470–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12139056 | doi = 10.1021/ac0256078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their design was able to achieve separations using an 80&amp;nbsp;mm long channel on the timescale of 3 minutes for particles with diameters ranging from 26 to 110&amp;nbsp;nm, but the authors expressed a need to improve the retention and [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] parameters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a 2010 publication by Jellema, Markesteijn, Westerweel, and Verpoorte, implementing HDC with a recirculating bidirectional flow resulted in high resolution, size based separation with only a 3&amp;nbsp;mm long channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jellema LJ, Markesteijn AP, Westerweel J, Verpoorte E | title = Tunable hydrodynamic chromatography of microparticles localized in short microchannels | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | pages = 4027–35 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20423105 | doi = 10.1021/ac902872d }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having such a short channel and high resolution was viewed as especially impressive considering that previous studies used channels that were 80&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For a biological application, in 2007, Huh, et al. proposed a microfluidic sorting device based on HDC and gravity, which was useful for preventing potentially dangerous particles with diameter larger than 6 microns from entering the bloodstream when injecting [[contrast agent]]s in [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huh D, Bahng JH, Ling Y, Wei HH, Kripfgans OD, Fowlkes JB, Grotberg JB, Takayama S | display-authors = 6 | title = Gravity-driven microfluidic particle sorting device with hydrodynamic separation amplification | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 1369–76 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17297936 | pmc = 2527745 | doi = 10.1021/ac061542n }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also made advances for environmental sustainability in microfluidics due to the lack of outside electronics driving the flow, which came as an advantage of using a gravity based device.[[File:GCxGC-TOFMS Analytical Dept Chemical Faculty GUT Gdansk.jpg |thumb|upright| Two-dimensional chromatograph GCxGC-TOFMS at [[Faculty of Chemistry, Gdańsk University of Technology|Chemical Faculty]] of [[Gdańsk University of Technology|GUT]] [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]], 2016]]

===Two-dimensional chromatography===
In some cases, the selectivity provided by the use of one column can be insufficient to provide resolution of analytes in complex samples. Two-dimensional chromatography aims to increase the resolution of these peaks by using a second column with different physico-chemical ([[chemical classification]]) properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prebihalo SE, Berrier KL, Freye CE, Bahaghighat HD, Moore NR, Pinkerton DK, Synovec RE | title = Multidimensional Gas Chromatography: Advances in Instrumentation, Chemometrics, and Applications | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 505–532 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29088543 | doi = 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoll DR, Carr PW | title = Two-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography: A State of the Art Tutorial | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 519–531 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27935671 | doi = 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation, it can be possible to separate compounds by [[two-dimensional chromatography]] that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography. Furthermore, the separation on the second dimension occurs faster than the first dimension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of a two-dimensional TLC separation is where the sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate, developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90° and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system. Two-dimensional chromatography can be applied to GC or LC separations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This separation method can also be used in a heart-cutting approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tranchida PQ, Sciarrone D, Dugo P, Mondello L | title = Heart-cutting multidimensional gas chromatography: a review of recent evolution, applications, and future prospects | journal = Analytica Chimica Acta | volume = 716 | pages = 66–75 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22284880 | doi = 10.1016/j.aca.2011.12.015 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267011016801 | series = A selection of papers presented at the 12th International Symposium on Extraction Technologies (ExTech 2010) }}&lt;/ref&gt; where specific regions of interest on the first dimension are selected for separation by the second dimension, or in a comprehensive approach,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where all the analytes from the first dimension undergo the second dimension separation.

===Simulated moving-bed chromatography===
{{details|Simulated moving bed}}
The simulated moving bed (SMB) technique is a variant of high performance liquid chromatography; it is used to separate particles and/or chemical compounds that would be difficult or impossible to resolve otherwise. This increased separation is brought about by a valve-and-column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely.
In the moving bed technique of preparative chromatography the feed entry and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous, but because of practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed, simulated moving bed technique was proposed. In the simulated moving bed technique instead of moving the bed, the sample inlet and the analyte exit positions are moved continuously, giving the impression of a moving bed.
True moving bed chromatography (TMBC) is only a theoretical concept. Its simulation, SMBC is achieved by the use of a multiplicity of columns in series and a complex valve arrangement, which provides for sample and solvent feed, and also analyte and waste takeoff at appropriate locations of any column, whereby it allows switching at regular intervals the sample entry in one direction, the solvent entry in the opposite direction, whilst changing the analyte and waste takeoff positions appropriately as well.

===Pyrolysis gas chromatography===
[[Pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry.

Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample is put into direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600–1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because a wide range of different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprints to prove material identity or the GC/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information. To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.

Besides the usage of dedicated pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30&amp;nbsp;°C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650&amp;nbsp;°C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case, quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.

===Fast protein liquid chromatography===
{{details|Fast protein liquid chromatography}}
Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), is a form of liquid chromatography that is often used to analyze or purify mixtures of proteins. As in other forms of chromatography, separation is possible because the different components of a mixture have different affinities for two materials, a moving fluid (the "mobile phase") and a porous solid (the stationary phase). In FPLC the mobile phase is an aqueous solution, or "buffer". The buffer flow rate is controlled by a positive-displacement pump and is normally kept constant, while the composition of the buffer can be varied by drawing fluids in different proportions from two or more external reservoirs. The stationary phase is a resin composed of beads, usually of cross-linked agarose, packed into a cylindrical glass or plastic column. FPLC resins are available in a wide range of bead sizes and surface ligands depending on the application.

===Countercurrent chromatography===
{{details|Countercurrent chromatography}}Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography, where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids and the liquid stationary phase is held stagnant by a strong centrifugal force.

==== Hydrodynamic countercurrent chromatography (CCC) ====
The operating principle of CCC instrument requires a column consisting of an open tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field to act on the column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is the latest and best-performing version of the instrumentation available currently.

==== Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) ====
{{Further|Centrifugal partition chromatography}}
In the CPC (centrifugal partition chromatography or hydrostatic countercurrent chromatography) instrument, the column consists of a series of cells interconnected by ducts attached to a rotor. This rotor rotates on its central axis creating the centrifugal field necessary to hold the stationary phase in place. The separation process in CPC is governed solely by the partitioning of solutes between the stationary and mobile phases, which mechanism can be easily described using the partition coefficients (''K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'') of solutes. CPC instruments are commercially available for laboratory, pilot, and industrial-scale separations with different sizes of columns ranging from some 10 milliliters to 10 liters volume.

===Periodic counter-current chromatography===
{{details|Periodic counter-current chromatography}}

In contrast to Counter current chromatography (see above), periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) uses a solid stationary phase and only a liquid mobile phase. It thus is much more similar to conventional [[affinity chromatography]] than to counter current chromatography. PCC uses multiple columns, which during the loading phase are connected in line. This mode allows for overloading the first column in this series without losing product, which already breaks through the column before the resin is fully saturated. The breakthrough product is captured on the subsequent column(s). In a next step the columns are disconnected from one another. The first column is washed and eluted, while the other column(s) are still being loaded. Once the (initially) first column is re-equilibrated, it is re-introduced to the loading stream, but as last column. The process then continues in a cyclic fashion.

===Chiral chromatography===
Chiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. [[Chiral column chromatography|Chiral chromatography HPLC columns]] (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.

Conventional chromatography  are incapable of separating racemic mixtures of enantiomers. However, in some cases ''nonracemic'' mixtures of enantiomers may be separated unexpectedly by conventional liquid chromatography (e. g. HPLC without chiral mobile phase or stationary phase ).&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Martens, [[Ravi Bhushan|Bhushan, R.]],  Mieczysław Sajewicz, Teresa Kowalska ''[[J. Chromatogr. Sci.]]'' '''2017''',  Vol. 55, 748–749. ({{doi|10.1093/chromsci/bmx031}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Martens, Ravi Bhushan,   ''[[Helv. Chim. Acta]]'' '''2014''',  Vol. 97, 161–187. ({{doi|10.1002/hlca.201300392}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aqueous normal-phase chromatography===
Aqueous normal-phase (ANP) chromatography is characterized by the elution behavior of classical normal phase mode (i.e. where the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase) in which water is one of the mobile phase solvent system components. It is distinguished from hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in that the retention mechanism is due to adsorption rather than partitioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulsing C, Nolvachai Y, Marriott PJ, Boysen RI, Matyska MT, Pesek JJ, Hearn MT | title = Insights into the origin of the separation selectivity with silica hydride adsorbents | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 119 | issue = 7 | pages = 3063–9 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25656442 | doi = 10.1021/jp5103753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Applications==
Chromatography is used in many fields including the [[pharmaceutical industry]], the [[Food industry|food]] and [[Drink industry|beverage]] industry, the [[chemical industry]], [[forensic science]], [[Biophysical environment|environment]] [[analysis]], and [[hospitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Chromatography: Definition, Working, and Importance in Various Industries|url=https://www.researchdive.com/blog/what-is-chromatography-how-does-it-work-and-where-is-it-used|access-date=2022-02-25|website=www.researchdive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{split|Biological rhythm|date=September 2020|discuss=Talk:Chronobiology#Proposed split}}
[[File:Biological clock human.PNG|upright=1.8|thumb|Overview, including some [[Physiology|physiological]] parameters, of the human [[Circadian rhythm|circadian rhythm ("biological clock")]].]]

'''Chronobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that examines [[Time|timing processes]], including periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms, such as their adaptation to [[sun|solar]]- and [[moon|lunar]]-related rhythms.&lt;ref name="chrono"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patricia J. DeCoursey |author2=Jay C. Dunlap |author3=Jennifer J. Loros  |title=Chronobiology |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-87893-149-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles are known as biological rhythms. Chronobiology comes from the ancient Greek [[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]] (''chrónos'', meaning "time"), and [[biology]], which pertains to the study, or science, of [[life]]. The related terms ''chronomics'' and ''chronome'' have been used in some cases to describe either the [[molecular]] mechanisms involved in chronobiological phenomena or the more quantitative aspects of chronobiology, particularly where comparison of cycles between organisms is required.

Chronobiological studies include but are not limited to comparative [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]] and [[behavior]] of organisms related to their [[biological rhythm]]s.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt;  Other aspects include [[epigenetics]], development, reproduction, ecology and evolution.

==The subject==
Chronobiology studies variations of the timing and duration of biological activity in living organisms which occur for many essential biological processes. These occur (a) in animals (eating, sleeping, mating, hibernating, migration, cellular regeneration, etc.), (b) in plants (leaf movements, [[photosynthetic]] reactions, etc.), and in microbial organisms such as fungi and protozoa. They have even been found in [[bacteria]], especially among the [[cyanobacteria]] (aka blue-green algae, see [[bacterial circadian rhythms]]). The best studied rhythm in chronobiology is the [[circadian rhythm]], a roughly 24-hour cycle shown by physiological processes in all these organisms. The term ''circadian'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''circa'', meaning "around" and ''dies'', "day", meaning "approximately a day." It is regulated by [[circadian clock]]s.

The circadian rhythm can further be broken down into routine cycles during the 24-hour day:&lt;ref&gt;Nelson RJ. 2005. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Massachusetts. Pg587.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diurnality|Diurnal]], which describes organisms active during daytime
* [[Nocturnal]], which describes organisms active in the night
* [[Crepuscular]], which describes animals primarily active during the dawn and dusk hours (ex: white-tailed deer, some bats)

While [[circadian rhythms]] are defined as regulated by [[endogenous]] processes, other biological cycles may be regulated by exogenous signals.  In some cases, multi-trophic systems may exhibit rhythms driven by the circadian clock of one of the members (which may also be influenced or reset by external factors).  The endogenous plant cycles may regulate the activity of the bacterium by controlling availability of plant-produced photosynthate.

Many other important cycles are also studied, including:
* [[Infradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles longer than a day. Examples include [[Circannual Cycle|circannual]] or annual cycles that govern migration or reproduction cycles in many plants and animals, or the human [[menstrual cycle]].
* [[Ultradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles shorter than 24 hours, such as the 90-minute [[REM cycle]], the 4-hour [[nasal cycle]], or the 3-hour cycle of [[growth hormone]] production.
* [[Tide|Tidal rhythms]], commonly observed in marine life, which follow the roughly 12.4-hour transition from high to low tide and back.
* [[Lunar rhythms]], which follow the [[lunar month]] (29.5 days). They are relevant e.g. for marine life, as the level of the tides is modulated across the lunar cycle. 
* [[Gene oscillations]] – some genes are [[gene expression|expressed]] more during certain hours of the day than during other hours.

Within each cycle, the time period during which the process is more active is called the ''[[wikt:acrophase|acrophase]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Refinetti, Roberto (2006). ''Circadian Physiology''. CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis Group. {{ISBN|0-8493-2233-2}}.  [http://www.circadian.org/dictionary.html Lay summary]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the process is less active, the cycle is in its ''[[wikt:bathyphase|bathyphase]]'' or ''trough'' phase.  The particular moment of highest activity is the ''peak'' or ''maximum''; the lowest point is the ''nadir''.

==History==
A circadian cycle was first observed in the 18th century in the movement of plant leaves by the French scientist [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]].&lt;ref&gt;for a description of circadian rhythms in plants by de Mairan, Linnaeus, and Darwin see [http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/museum/exhibit00/02_1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225212335/http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/museum/exhibit00/02_1.html |date=2005-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751 Swedish [[botanist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) designed a [[Linnaeus' flower clock|flower clock]] using certain species of [[flowering plant]]s. By arranging the selected species in a circular pattern, he designed a clock that indicated the time of day by the flowers that were open at each given hour. For example, among members of the [[daisy family]], he used the [[Crepis|hawk's beard]] plant which opened its flowers at 6:30 am and the [[hawkbit]] which did not open its flowers until 7 am.&lt;ref name="linnean"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Library-and-Archives/4-Floral%20Clock.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212123532/http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Library-and-Archives/4-Floral%20Clock.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960 symposium at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] laid the groundwork for the field of chronobiology.&lt;ref name="Kreitzman2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Leon Kreitzman |author2=Russell G. Foster |title=Rhythms of life: the biological clocks that control the daily lives of every living thing |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2004 |isbn=0-300-10969-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also in 1960 that [[Patricia DeCoursey]] invented the [[phase response curve]], one of the major tools used in the field since.

[[Franz Halberg]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], who coined the word ''circadian'', is widely considered the "father of American chronobiology." However, it was [[Colin Pittendrigh]] and not Halberg who was elected to lead the ''Society for Research in Biological Rhythms'' in the 1970s.

==The role of Retinal Ganglion cells==
===Melanopsin as a circadian photopigment===
In 2002, [[Samer Hattar|Hattar]] and his colleagues showed that [[melanopsin]] plays a key role in a variety of photic responses, including [[pupillary light reflex]], and synchronization of the [[Circadian rhythm|biological clock]] to daily light-dark cycles. He also described the role of melanopsin in [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell|ipRGCs]]. Using a rat melanopsin gene, a melanopsin-specific antibody, and [[Immunocytochemistry|fluorescent immunocytochemistry]], the team concluded that melanopsin is expressed in some RGCs. Using a [[Beta-galactosidase]] assay, they found that these RGC [[axons]] exit the eyes together with the [[optic nerve]] and project to the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), the primary circadian pacemaker in [[mammal]]s. They also demonstrated that the RGCs containing melanopsin were intrinsically photosensitive. Hattar concluded that melanopsin is the photopigment in a small subset of RGCs that contributes to the intrinsic photosensitivity of these cells and is involved in their non-image forming functions, such as photic entrainment and pupillary light reflex.&lt;ref name="Fly in mammalian eye" /&gt;

===Melanopsin cells relay inputs from rods and cones===
[[File:Phototransduction and ipRGCs in mammals.jpg|thumb|alt=Phototransduction and ipRGCs in mammals|Light enters the eye and hits the retinal pigmented epithelium (maroon). This excites rods (grey) and cones (blue/red). These cells synapse onto bipolar cells (pink), which stimulate ipRGCs (green) and RGCs (orange). Both RGCs and ipRGCs transmit information to the brain through the optic nerve. Furthermore, light can directly stimulate the ipRGCs through its melanopsin photopigment. The ipRGCs uniquely project to the superchiasmatic nucleus, allowing the organism to entrain to light-dark cycles.]]
Hattar, armed with the knowledge that melanopsin was the photopigment responsible for the photosensitivity of ipRGCs, set out to study the exact role of the ipRGC in photoentrainment. In 2008, Hattar and his research team transplanted [[diphtheria]] toxin [[genes]] into the [[mouse]] melanopsin gene locus to create [[mutation|mutant]] mice that lacked ipRGCs. The research team found that while the mutants had little difficulty identifying visual targets, they could not entrain to light-dark cycles.  These results led Hattar and his team to conclude that ipRGCs do not affect image-forming vision, but significantly affect non-image forming functions such as photoentrainment.&lt;ref name="Fly in mammalian eye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Dustin|title=Melanopsin Ganglion Cells: A Bit of Fly in the Mammalian Eye|url=http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/elanopsin-ganglion-cells-a-bit-of-fly-in-the-mammalian-eye/|website=Webvision The Organization of the Retina and Visual System|publisher=University of Utah School of Medicine|accessdate=9 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427132440/http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/elanopsin-ganglion-cells-a-bit-of-fly-in-the-mammalian-eye/|archivedate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinct ipRGCs===
Further research has shown that ipRGCs project to different brain nuclei to control both non-image forming and image forming functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Blurring the boundaries of vision: novel functions of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|last = Matynia|first = Anna|date = September 3, 2013|journal = Journal of Experimental Neuroscience|doi = 10.4137/JEN.S11267|pmc = 4089729|pmid=25157207|volume=7|pages=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; These brain regions include the SCN, where input from ipRGCs is necessary to photoentrain circadian rhythms, and the [[pretectal area|olivary pretectal nucleus]] (OPN), where input from ipRGCs control the pupillary light reflex.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Retinal Ganglion Cell Maps in the Brain: Implications for Visual Processing|last1 = Dhande|first1 = OS|date = November 19, 2013|journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology|doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2013.08.006|pmc = 4086677|last2 = Huberman|first2 = AD|volume=24|issue = 1|pages=133–142|pmid=24492089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hattar and colleagues conducted research that demonstrated that ipRGCs project to hypothalamic, thalamic, stratal, brainstem and limbic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging, Cognition, Light and Circadian Rhythms|author1=Gaggioni G |author2=Maquet P |author3=Schmidt C |author4=Dijk Dj |author5=Vandealle G |date = July 8, 2014|journal = Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|doi = 10.3389/fnsys.2014.00126|pmc = 4086398|pmid=25071478|volume=8|pages=126|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ipRGCs were initially viewed as a uniform population, further research revealed that there are several subtypes with distinct morphology and physiology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since 2011, Hattar's laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hattar Lab|url=http://hattarlab.johnshopkins.edu/pages/research.php|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=27 December 2016|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has contributed to these findings and has successfully distinguished subtypes of ipRGCs.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Diversity of ipRGCs===
Hattar and colleges utilized [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-based]] strategies for labeling ipRGCs to reveal that there are at least five ipRGC subtypes that project to a number of central targets.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Five classes of ipRGCs, M1 through M5, have been characterized to date in rodents. These classes differ in morphology, dendritic localization, melanopsin content, electrophysiological profiles, and projections.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Diversity in M1 cells===
Hattar and his co-workers discovered that, even among the subtypes of ipRGC, there can be designated sets that differentially control circadian versus pupillary behavior. In experiments with M1 ipRGCs, they discovered that the transcription factor [[POU4F2|Brn3b]] is expressed by M1 ipRGCs that target the OPN, but not by ones that target the SCN. Using this knowledge, they designed an experiment to cross Melanopsin-[[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre]] mice with mice that conditionally expressed a toxin from the Brn3b locus. This allowed them to selectively ablate only the OPN projecting M1 ipRGCS, resulting in a loss of pupil reflexes. However, this did not impair circadian photo entrainment. This demonstrated that the M1 ipRGC consist of molecularly distinct subpopulations that innervate different brain regions and execute specific light-induced functions.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; This isolation of a 'labeled line' consisting of differing molecular and functional properties in a highly specific ipRGC subtype was an important first for the field. It also underscored the extent to which molecular signatures can be used to distinguish between RGC populations that would otherwise appear the same, which in turn facilitates further investigation into their specific contributions to visual processing.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Psychological impact of light exposure==
Previous studies in circadian biology have established that exposure to light during abnormal hours leads to [[sleep deprivation]] and disruption of the circadian system, which affect mood and [[Cognition|cognitive functioning]]. While this indirect relationship had been corroborated, not much work had been done to examine whether there was a direct relationship between irregular light exposure, aberrant mood, cognitive function, normal sleep patterns and circadian oscillations. In a study published in 2012, the Hattar Laboratory was able to show that deviant light cycles directly induce [[Depression (mood)|depression]]-like symptoms and lead to impaired learning in mice, independent of [[sleep]] and circadian oscillations.&lt;ref name=Dulcis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dulcis|first1=Davide|last2=Jamshidi|first2=Pouya|last3=Leutgeb|first3=Stefan|last4=Spitzer|first4=Nicholas C.|title=Neurotransmitter Switching in the Adult Brain Regulates Behavior|journal=Science|date=26 April 2013|volume=340|issue=6131|pages=449–453|bibcode=2013Sci...340..449D|doi=10.1126/science.1234152|pmid=23620046|s2cid=44911091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on mood===
ipRGCs project to areas of the brain that are important for regulating circadian rhythmicity and sleep, most notably the [[Suprachiasmatic nucleus|SCN]], subparaventricular nucleus, and the ventrolateral preoptic area. In addition, ipRGCs transmit information to many areas in the [[limbic system]], which is strongly tied to emotion and memory. To examine the relationship between deviant light exposure and behavior, Hattar and his colleagues studied mice exposed to alternating 3.5-hour light and dark periods (T7 mice) and compared them with mice exposed to alternating 12-hour light and dark periods (T24 mice).  Compared to a T24 cycle, the T7 mice got the same amount of total sleep and their circadian expression of [[PER2]], an element of the SCN pacemaker, was not disrupted. Through the T7 cycle, the mice were exposed to light at all circadian phases. Light pulses presented at night lead to expression of the transcription factor [[c-Fos]] in the [[amygdala]], [[habenula|lateral habenula]], and subparaventricular nucleus further implicating light's possible influence on mood and other cognitive functions.&lt;ref name=Masana&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masana|first1=MI|title=Light-induced c-fos mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the retina of C3H/HeN mice.|journal=Molecular Brain Research|date= December 1996|volume=42|issue=2|pages=193–201|doi=10.1016/s0169-328x(96)00031-9|pmid=9013774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mice subjected to the T7 cycle exhibited depression-like symptoms, exhibiting decreased preference for [[sucrose]] (sucrose anhedonia) and exhibiting more immobility than their T24 counterparts in the [[behavioural despair test|forced swim test (FST)]].  Additionally, T7 mice maintained rhythmicity in serum [[corticosterone]], however the levels were elevated compared to the T24 mice, a trend that is associated with depression. Chronic administration of the antidepressant [[Fluoxetine]] lowered corticosterone levels in T7 mice and reduced depression-like behavior while leaving their circadian rhythms unaffected.&lt;ref name=Dulcis /&gt;

===Effect on learning===
The [[hippocampus]] is a structure in the limbic system that receives projections from ipRGCs. It is required for the consolidation of [[short-term memory|short-term memories]] into [[long-term memory|long-term memories]] as well as spatial orientation and navigation. Depression and heightened serum corticosterone levels are linked to impaired hippocampal learning. Hattar and his team analyzed the T7 mice in the [[Morris water navigation task|Morris water maze (MWM)]], a spatial learning task that places a mouse in a small pool of water and tests the mouse's ability to locate and remember the location of a rescue platform located just below the waterline.  Compared to the T24 mice, the T7 mice took longer to find the platform in subsequent trials and did not exhibit a preference for the quadrant containing the platform. In addition, T7 mice exhibited impaired hippocampal [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) when subjected to [[Theta Burst Stimulation|theta burst stimulation]] (TBS). Recognition memory was also affected, with T7 mice failing to show preference for novel objects in the novel object recognition test.&lt;ref name=Sauer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauer|first1=Jonas-Frederic|title=Impaired fast-spiking interneuron function in a genetic mouse model of depression|journal=eLife|date=3 March 2015|volume=4|doi=10.7554/elife.04979|pmid=25735038|pmc=4374525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity of ipRGCs===
Mice without (Opn4&lt;sup&gt;aDTA/aDTA&lt;/sup&gt; mice) are not susceptible to the negative effects of an aberrant light cycle, indicating that light information transmitted through these cells plays an important role in regulation of mood and cognitive functions such as learning and memory.&lt;ref name=Monteggia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monteggia|first1=Lisa|last2=Kavalali|first2=E. T.|title=Circadian rhythms: Depression brought to light|journal=Nature|volume=491|issue=7425|pages=537–538|doi=10.1038/nature11752|pmid=23151474|year=2012|bibcode=2012Natur.491..537M|s2cid=4391543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research developments==
;Light and melatonin
More recently, [[light therapy]] and [[melatonin (medication)|melatonin]] administration have been explored by [[Alfred J. Lewy]] ([[OHSU]]), [[Josephine Arendt]] ([[University of Surrey]], UK) and other researchers as a means to reset animal and human circadian rhythms. Additionally, the presence of low-level light at night accelerates circadian re-entrainment of hamsters of all ages by 50%; this is thought to be related to simulation of moonlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = D. W. | last2 = Evans | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Gorman | first3 = M.

In the second half of 20th century, substantial contributions and formalizations have been made by Europeans such as [[Jürgen Aschoff]] and [[Colin Pittendrigh]], who pursued different but complementary views on the phenomenon of [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the circadian system by light (parametric, continuous, tonic, gradual vs. nonparametric, discrete, phasic, instantaneous, respectively&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jbr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/15/3/195 this historical article], subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;).

;Chronotypes
Humans can have a propensity to be morning people or evening people; these behavioral preferences are called [[chronotype]]s for which there are various assessment questionnaires and biological marker correlations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of When|last=Breus, PHD|first=Michael|publisher=Little Brown and Company|year=2016|isbn=978-0-316-39126-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mealtimes
There is also a food-entrainable biological clock, which is not confined to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The location of this clock has been disputed. Working with mice, however, Fuller ''et al.'' concluded that the food-entrainable clock seems to be located in the dorsomedial [[hypothalamus]]. During restricted feeding, it takes over control of such functions as activity timing, increasing the chances of the animal successfully locating food resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Patrick M. |author2=Jun Lu |author3=Clifford B.

;Diurnal patterns on the Internet
In 2018 a study published in PLoS ONE showed how 73 psychometric indicators measured on Twitter Content follow a diurnal pattern.

A followup study appeared on Chronobiology International in 2021 showed that these patterns were not disrupted by the 2020 UK lockdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Sheng |author2=Stafford Lightman |author3= Nello Cristianini  |date=2021-06-17 |title= Effect of the lockdown on diurnal patterns of emotion expression in Twitter |journal= Chronobiology International |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=1591–1610 |doi= 10.1080/07420528.2021.1937198|pmid=34134583 |s2cid=235462661 |url=https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/d064a56f-5da0-4210-95dc-f575acdf3b68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Modulators of circadian rhythms
In 2021, scientists reported the development of a light-responsive days-lasting modulator of circadian rhythms of tissues [[Casein kinase 1#Circadian rhythm|via Ck1 inhibition]]. Such modulators may be useful for chronobiology research and repair of organs that are "out of sync".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Resetting the biological clock by flipping a switch |url=https://phys.org/news/2021-05-resetting-biological-clock-flipping.html |access-date=14 June 2021 |work=phys.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kolarski |first1=Dušan |last2=Miró-Vinyals |first2=Carla |last3=Sugiyama |first3=Akiko |last4=Srivastava |first4=Ashutosh |last5=Ono |first5=Daisuke |last6=Nagai |first6=Yoshiko |last7=Iida |first7=Mui |last8=Itami |first8=Kenichiro |last9=Tama |first9=Florence |last10=Szymanski |first10=Wiktor |last11=Hirota |first11=Tsuyoshi |last12=Feringa |first12=Ben L. |title=Reversible modulation of circadian time with chronophotopharmacology |journal=Nature Communications |date=2021-05-26 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=3164 |doi=10.1038/s41467-021-23301-x |pmid=34039965 |pmc=8155176 |bibcode=2021NatCo..12.3164K |language=en |issn=2041-1723}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Available under [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ CC BY 4.0].&lt;/ref&gt;

The research was published in March 2011 in the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' by [[Richard B. Hoover]], an engineer. However, NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claim and his lack of expert peer-reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kerry | last = Sheridan | title = NASA shoots down alien fossil claims | date = 7 March 2011 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/08/3157645.htm | work = ABC News | access-date = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
{{Main|Journal of Cosmology#Hoover paper controversy}}
Hoover's team used Environmental ([[ESEM]]) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy ([[FESEM]]) to analyze the meteorite samples, studying internal surfaces. Hoover also produced  electron micrographs which he believes resemble the shape of [[trichomic]] [[cyanobacteria]] and other trichomic [[prokaryotes]] such as the [[filamentous sulfur bacteria]]. For comparison, Hoover compared the samples to those of terrestrial minerals and biological materials. Hoover concludes from these results that the CI1 fossils are indigenous to the samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html | journal=[[Journal of Cosmology]] | year=2011 | volume=13 | title=Fossils of Cyanobacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites: Implications to Life on Comets, Europa, and Enceladus | first=Richard B. | last=Hoover | access-date=2011-03-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308034118/http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html | archive-date=2011-03-08 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims were initially submitted to the ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]'', which rejected the paper,&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt; but were eventually published by the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]''. NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claims,&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;

A '''circannual cycle''' is a biological process that occurs in living creatures over the period of approximately one year. This cycle was first discovered by Ebo Gwinner and Canadian biologist Ted Pengelley.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is classified as an [[Infradian rhythm]], which is biological process with a period longer than that of a circadian rhythm, less than one cycle per 24 hours. These processes continue even in artificial environments in which seasonal cues have been removed by scientists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Circannual rhythm |work=Oxford Reference |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095613678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term circannual is Latin, [[wikt:circa#Latin|circa]] meaning approximately and [[wikt:annual|annual]] relating to one year. [[Chronobiology]] is the field of biology pertaining to periodic rhythms that occur in living organisms in response to external stimuli such as [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]].

Cycles come from genetic evolution in animals which allows them to create regulatory cycles to improve their fitness.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murphy BA | title = Circadian and Circannual Regulation in the Horse: Internal Timing in an Elite Athlete | journal = Journal of Equine Veterinary Science | volume = 76 | pages = 14–24 | date = May 2019 | pmid = 31084748 | doi = 10.1016/j.jevs.2019.02.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution for these traits comes from the increased reproductive success of animals most capable of predicting the regular changes in the environment like seasonal changes and adapt capitalize on the times when success was greatest.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019/&gt; The idea of evolved biological clocks exists not only for animals but also in plant species which exhibit cyclic behaviors without environmental cues.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019/&gt;  Plentiful research has been done on the biological clocks and what behaviors they are responsible for in animals, circannual rhythms are just one example of a biological clock.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019/&gt;

Rhythms are driven by hormone cycles and seasonal rhythms can endure for long periods of time in animals even without photoperiod signaling which comes with seasonal changes.&lt;ref name="Wood et al 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wood SH, Christian HC, Miedzinska K, Saer BR, Johnson M, Paton B, Yu L, McNeilly J, Davis JR, McNeilly AS, Burt DW, Loudon AS | display-authors = 6 | title = Binary Switching of Calendar Cells in the Pituitary Defines the Phase of the Circannual Cycle in Mammals | journal = Current Biology | volume = 25 | issue = 20 | pages = 2651–62 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26412130 | pmc = 4612467 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a driver of annual behaviors such as hibernation, mating and the gain or loss of weight for seasonal changes.&lt;ref name="Wood et al 2015"/&gt; Circannual cycles can be defined by three main aspects being that they must persist without apparent time cues, be able to be phase shifted, and should not be changed by temperature.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019/&gt; Circannual cycles have important impacts on when animal behaviors are performed and the success of those behaviors.&lt;ref name="Wood et al 2015"/&gt; Circannual cycles can be defined by three main aspects being that they must persist without apparent time cues, be able to be phase shifted, and should not be changed by temperature.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019/&gt;

The location of the physical circannual timer in organisms and how it works are almost entirely unknown.

== Examples ==
In one study performed by Eberhard Gwinner, two species of birds were born in a controlled environment without ever being exposed to external stimuli. They were presented with a fixed [[Photoperiodism|Photoperiod]] of 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness each day. The birds were exposed to these conditions for eight years and consistently molted at the same time as they would have in the wild, indicating that this physiological cycle is innate rather than governed environmentally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chelonia.org/Articles/Biological_clocks.htm|title=Circannual Rhythms, Seasonal Change, Climate and Stress - Darrell Senneke|website=www.chelonia.org|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Ted Pengelley and Ken Fisher studied the circannual clock in the golden-mantled ground squirrel. They exposed the squirrels to twelve hours of light and 12 hours of darkness and at a constant temperature for three years. Despite this constant cycle, they continued to hibernate once a year with each episode preceded by an increase in body weight and food consumption. During the first year, the squirrels began hibernation in late October. They started hibernating in mid August and early April respectively for the following two years, displaying a circannual rhythm with a period of about 10 months.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Foster RG, Kreitzman L.

An annual rhythm has been observed in humans diagnosed with obsessive compulsive tic disorder (OCTD). The study focused on observing the patients’ seasonal patterns and how the cycle of seasons affected their behaviors. They observed that there was a statistically significant annual rhythm in patients with OC symptoms but not in patients with tic symptoms. As a result of the study, the researchers concluded that treatments for this disorder can be implemented following an observation of the patient’s cycle and annual rhythm that they follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vitale JA, Briguglio M, Galentino R, Dell'Osso B, Malgaroli A, Banfi G, Porta M | title = Exploring circannual rhythms and chronotype effect in patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Tic Disorder (OCTD): A pilot study | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 262 | pages = 286–292 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 31733921 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.040 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gwinner observed the willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) which is a bird species that migrates seasonally to tropical and southern Africa. They follow an annual cycle of migration starting in September and ending in mid-November for the winter and then migrate back between March and May. The willow warblers follow this cycle to maximize reproduction in the spring/summer as well as increasing available resources in the fall/winter. Gwinner observed that even through a lack of environmental cues for migration, the willow warblers followed precise schedules attributed to their circannual rhythm. The willow warblers would consistently molt between January and February, they would have gonadal growth initiate in the winter and continue on their migration back for the spring, and they would begin a fattening process precisely at the same time year after year for their spring migrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gwinner E |title=Circannual Rhythms in Bird Migration |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |date=November 1977 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=381–405 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.08.110177.002121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic example in insects is the [[varied carpet beetle]]. In a study performed by T. Nisimura and H. Numata in 2003, the seasonal timing and synchrony of pupation in the Varied Carpet Beetle (Anthrenus verbasci) was determined by studying how natural patterns in photoperiod and temperature affected it.&lt;ref name="Nisimura &amp; Numata 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nisimura T, Numata H |title=Circannual control of the life cycle in the Varied Carpet Beetle Anthrenus verbasci: Circannual control of life cycle in a beetle |journal=Functional Ecology |date=August 2003 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=489–495 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.2003.00753.x |jstor=3598986 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors first fostered larvae under various constant photoperiods at a constant temperature of 20℃ to determine if there was a critical duration of the photophase that affected the phase of circannual rhythm. Secondly, they examined if a decrease in temperature caused a phase-shift in the circannual rhythm. Third, they fostered larvae under a natural photoperiod at a constant temperature of 20℃ and compared it to a group under natural photoperiod and temperature. Lastly, to clarify the significance of the circannual control of the A. verbasci life cycle, larvae were reared under natural photoperiod and temperature from the various times of the year.&lt;ref name="Nisimura &amp; Numata 2003"/&gt; The results showed that the critical day-length was between 13 and 14 hours of light, that a decrease in temperature of 5℃ did not affect the phase-shift, that larvae under controlled light but fluctuating temperatures experienced a delay in pupation compared to natural light and natural temperatures and that spring in Japan was the best time of the year for synchronous pupation which slowed as spring turned to summer.&lt;ref name="Nisimura &amp; Numata 2003"/&gt;

Circannual and circadian rhythms can be influenced by metabolism which is primarily influenced from natural external environmental factors such as daily weather and seasons. Location adaptations are needed to survive in extreme environmental changes.&lt;ref name="Reyes &amp; Milsom 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reyes C, Milsom WK | title = Circadian and circannual rhythms in the metabolism and ventilation of red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) | journal = Physiological and Biochemical Zoology | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–98 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19358691 | doi = 10.1086/597518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rhythms are influenced by variable environmental cues, and in some species are influenced by internal cues. In a study conducted by Catalina Reyes, the authors took a further look into how red-eared sliders showed circadian and circannual rhythms in metabolism, and if metabolic rates overall influenced the circadian and circannual cues. These rhythms were studied over one year, and displayed evidence of endogenous circadian and circannual rhythms in metabolism.&lt;ref name="Reyes &amp; Milsom 2010"/&gt; The understanding was that in order for these rhythms to be expressed, environmental cues influenced these thermo and phyto cycles eliciting circadian and circannual rhythms of the red-eared sliders. The sensitivity to these environmental influences reflect adaptations to migration patterns that could serve as further insight to the cost-and-benefit of transportation and risk of predation.&lt;ref name="Reyes &amp; Milsom 2010"/&gt;

Environmental external factors are the key drivers into influencing circannual and circadian rhythms. Although they may all differ depending on species, they all are influenced by factors like weather and seasonality. At temperate latitudes, circannual rhythms align with the day lengths, and in mammals, the hormone melatonin is reactive to the proportional length of evenings.&lt;ref name="Hazlerigg et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hazlerigg D, Blix AS, Stokkan KA | title = Waiting for the Sun: the circannual programme of reindeer is delayed by the recurrence of rhythmical melatonin secretion after the arctic night | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 220 | issue = Pt 21 | pages = 3869–3872 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28864562 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.163741 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors that collaborated on this study focused on the circannual alignment of, (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), better known as arctic reindeer. They are known to limit production of a rhythmic melatonin signal when exposed to prolonged periods of midwinter darkness and midsummer light.&lt;ref name="Hazlerigg et al 2017"/&gt; Areas in temperate regions are known to have prolonged periods of light and darkness, for instance, like in Alaska. They concluded that rhythmical melatonin secretion is a psychological response to the orientation of the sun in early winter months and the delay of circuannual programme during the following autumnal months.&lt;ref name="Hazlerigg et al 2017"/&gt;

== Biological advantages ==
Generating biological rhythms internally helps organisms anticipate important changes in the environment before they occur, thus providing the organisms with time to prepare and survive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, some plants have a very strict time frame in regards to blooming and preparing for spring. If they begin their preparations too early or too late they risk not being pollinated, competing with different species, or other factors that might affect their survival rate. Having a circannual cycle may keep them from making this mistake if a particular geographic region experiences a false spring, where the weather becomes exceptionally warm early for a short period of time before returning to winter temperatures.

Similarly, bird plumage and mammal fur change with the approach of winter, and is triggered by the shortening photoperiod of autumn.&lt;ref name=Gwinner1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gwinner E |title=Circannual clocks in avian reproduction and migration |journal=Ibis |date=2008-06-28 |volume=138 |issue=1 |pages=47–63 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919x.1996.tb04312.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circannual cycle can also be useful for animals that [[Animal migration|Migrate]] or [[Hibernation|Hibernate]]. Many animals' reproductive organs change in response to changes in photoperiod. Male gonads will grow during the onset of spring to promote reproduction among the species. These enlarged gonads would be nearly impossible to keep year round and would be inefficient for the species. Many female animals will only produce eggs during certain times of the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Interaction with changing climate ==
Changing climate may unravel ecosystems in which different organisms use different internal calendars. Warming temperatures may lead to earlier blooms of flora in spring. For instance, one study performed by Menzel et al., analyzed 125,000 phenological records of 542 plant species in 21 European countries from 1971 to 2000 and found that 78% of all plants studied advanced in flowering, leafing, and fruiting while only three percent were significantly delayed. They determined that the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Menzel A, Sparks TH, Estrella N, Koch E, Aasa A, Ahas R, Alm-Kübler K, Bissolli P, Braslavská OG, Briede A, Chmielewski FM | display-authors = 6  |title=European phenological response to climate change matches the warming pattern |journal=Global Change Biology |date=October 2006 |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=1969–1976 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01193.x |bibcode=2006GCBio..12.1969M |citeseerx=10.1.1.167.960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, fauna may breed or migrate based on the length of day, and thus might arrive too late for critical food supplies they co-evolved with.

For example, the [[Parus major]] closely times the hatching of their chicks to the emergence of the protein-rich winter moth caterpillar, which in turn hatches to meet the budding of oaks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These birds are a single-brood bird, meaning they breed once a year with about nine chicks per brood. If the birds and caterpillars and buds all emerge at the right time, the caterpillars eat the new oak leaves and their population increases dramatically, and this hopefully will coincide with the arrival of the new chicks, allowing them to eat. But if plants, insects, and birds respond differently to the advance of spring or other [[phenology]] changes, the relationship may be altered.

As another example, studies of the Pied Flycatcher ([[ficedula hypoleuca]]) have shown that their spring migration timing is triggered by an internal circannual clock that is fine tuned to day length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These particular birds overwinter in dry tropical forest in Western Africa and breed in temperate forests in Europe, over 4,500&amp;nbsp;km away. From 1980-2000, temperatures at the time of arrival and the start of breeding have warmed significantly. They have advanced their mean laying date by ten days, but have not advanced the spring arrival on their breeding grounds because their migration behavior is triggered by photoperiod rather than temperature.&lt;ref name=Gwinner1996/&gt;

In short, even if each individual species can easily live with elevated temperatures, disruptions of [[phenology]] timing at ecosystem level may still imperil them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges for scientific study ==
One reason for the paucity of research on circannual cycles is the duration of required efforts. The ratio of the period length of a circannual cycle to the length of the productive life of a scientist makes this branch of chronobiology difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It takes an entire year to get a time series which makes it difficult to see how these cycles adjust over the years. To put this into perspective, a two-week experiment for a circadian biologist would take fourteen years for a circannual researcher, in order to achieve the same level of data robustness for the conclusions.

[[Circadian_rhythm|Circadian Rhythm]] - If circadian rhythm enables animals to prepare physiologically and behaviorally for certain predictable daily changes in the environment, might not some animals possess a circannual rhythm that runs on an approximately 365 cycle? A circannual clock mechanism could be similar to the circadian master clock, with an environment-independent timer capable of generating a circannual rhythm in conjunction with a mechanism that keeps the clock entertained to local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock J. 2013.

[[Nocturnality]]  is when animals are active during the night, and inactive during the day. This adaptation allows for animals to avoid predators that may not have this adaptability, as well as having availability to resources that are otherwise not harvested by non-nocturnal animals. Some animals that are nocturnal have disadvantages in animal sensory systems, such as bats, they have poor vision and use other adaptations such as echolocation, something a non-nocturnal animal would not have. 

[[Photoperiodism]] is the ability of plants and animals to use the length of day or night, resulting in the modification of their activities.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel 2017"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/bs.adgen.2017.09.002 |chapter=Natural Variation and Genetics of Photoperiodism in Wyeomyia smithii |title=Natural Variation and Clocks |series=Advances in Genetics |year=2017 | vauthors = Bradshaw WE, Holzapfel CM |volume=99 |pages=39–71 |pmid=29050554 |isbn=978-0-12-811811-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A response from an organism to the length in daylight and time that allows for adaptations to seasonal variations and environmental changes. It orchestrates seasonal growth, development, reproduction, migration, and dormancy that affect survivorship and reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel 2017"/&gt; Changes in photoperiod over days and seasons created the opportunity for the development of internal clocks and eventually create circadian and circannual rhythms.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019/&gt;  Photoperiod can affect the circannual rhythms of animals if changed significantly.&lt;ref name=Murphy2019/&gt;

      <text bytes="2497" xml:space="preserve">In [[biological classification]], '''circumscriptional names''' are [[taxon]] names that are not ruled by [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] and are defined by the particular set of members included. Circumscriptional names are used mainly for taxa above [[Family (biology)|family]]-group level (e. g. [[Order (biology)|order]] or [[Class (biology)|class]]), but can be also used for taxa of any [[Taxonomic rank|ranks]], as well as for rank-less taxa.

Non-typified names other than those of the [[genus]]- or [[species]]-group constitute the majority of generally accepted names of [[taxon|taxa]] higher than [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]]. The ICZN regulates names of taxa up to family group rank (i. e. superfamily). There are no generally accepted rules of naming higher taxa (orders, classes, phyla, etc.). Under the approach of [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]-based (circumscriptional) nomenclatures, a circumscriptional name is associated with a certain circumscription of a taxon without regard of its rank or position. 

Some authors advocate introducing a mandatory standardized typified nomenclature of higher taxa. They suggest all names of higher taxa to be derived in the same manner as family-group names, i.e. by modifying names of type genera with endings to reflect the rank. There is no consensus on what such higher rank endings should be. A number of established practices exist as to the use of typified names of higher taxa, depending on animal group.

The City Nature Challenge was founded by Alison Young and Rebecca Johnson of the [[California Academy of Sciences]] and Lila Higgins of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name=marin2017/&gt; The first challenge was in the spring of 2016 between Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;ref name=netburn2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis2016/&gt; Participants documented over 20,000 observations with the [[iNaturalist]] platform.&lt;ref name=cnc2016/&gt; In 2017, the challenge expanded to 16 cities across the United States and participants collected over 125,000 observations of wildlife in 5 days.&lt;ref name=cnc2017/&gt; In 2018, the challenge expanded to 68 cities across the world.&lt;ref name=bray2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnc2017/&gt; In four days, over 441,000 observations of more than 18,000 species were observed, and over 17,000 people participated.&lt;ref name=higgins2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=cncabout/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnc20180504/&gt; The 2019 challenge more than doubled in scale, with almost a million observations of over 31,000 species observed by around 35,000 people.&lt;ref name=cnc2019cities/&gt;&lt;ref name=2019resultsarein/&gt;

Taking the competition beyond its US roots, the 2019 event was a much more international affair, with the winning city for observations and species coming from Africa ([[Cape Town]]), and three South American ([[La Paz]], [[Tena, Ecuador|Tena]] and [[Quito]]) and two Asian areas ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Klang Valley]]) ranking in the top ten for number of observations.{{r|cnc2019}}

In 2020, the organizers removed the competition aspect due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], stating, "To ensure the safety and health of all participants, this year’s CNC is no longer a competition. Instead, we want to embrace the collaborative aspect of sharing observations online with a digital community, and celebrate the healing power of nature as people document their local biodiversity to the best of their ability."{{r|cnccovid}} Fewer observations were documented in 2020 than the prior year, though more species were found and more cities and people participated.{{r|cnc2020results}}

2021 and 2022 each saw successive records in every category, but as in 2020, no winning cities were announced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;ref name=cnchome/&gt;&lt;ref name=2022cnc&gt;{{Cite web |title=City Nature Challenge 2022 |url=https://citynaturechallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CNC-2022-results-infographic-with-fixed-links.pdf |website=citynaturechallenge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clade-grade II.svg|thumb|400px|[[Cladogram]] (family tree) of a biological group. The [[last common ancestor]] is the vertical line ''stem'' at the bottom. The blue and red subgroups are clades; each shows its common ancestor stem at the bottom of the subgroup ''branch''. The green subgroup is ''not'' a clade; it is a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic group]], because it excludes the blue branch which has descended from the same common ancestor. The green and blue subgroups together form a clade again.]]

A '''clade''' ({{etymology|grc|''κλάδος'' (kládos)|branch}}), also known as a '''monophyletic group''' or '''natural group''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin  |first1=Elizabeth |title=A Dictionary of Biology |last2=Hin |first2=Robert |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of [[organism]]s that are [[monophyly|monophyletic]] – that is, composed of a [[common ancestor]] and all its [[lineage (evolution)|lineal descendants]] – on a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Assembling the Tree of Life |url=https://archive.org/details/assemblingtreeli00crac_335 |url-access=limited |editor-first=Joel |editor-last=Cracraft |editor2-first=Michael J. |editor2-last=Donoghue |chapter=Introduction |page=[https://archive.org/details/assemblingtreeli00crac_335/page/n18 1] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-972960-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than the English term, the equivalent [[Latin]] term ''cladus'' (plural ''cladi'') is often used in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] literature.

The common ancestor may be an individual, a [[population]], or a [[species]] ([[extinct]] or [[Extant taxon|extant]]). Clades are nested, one in another, as each branch in turn splits into smaller branches. These splits reflect [[evolutionary history]] as populations diverged and evolved independently. Clades are termed monophyletic (Greek: "one clan") groups.

Over the last few decades, the cladistic approach has revolutionized biological classification and revealed surprising evolutionary relationships among organisms.&lt;ref name="Palmer, Douglas 2009. p. 13"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolution: The Story of Life |last=Palmer |first=Douglas |publisher=University of California Press |year=2009 |location=Berkeley |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, taxonomists try to avoid naming [[Taxon|taxa]] that are not clades; that is, taxa that are not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. Some of the relationships between organisms that the molecular biology arm of cladistics has revealed include that [[fungi]] are closer relatives to animals than they are to plants, [[archaea]] are now considered different from [[bacteria]], and multicellular organisms may have evolved from archaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pace |first=Norman R. |date=2006-05-18 |title=Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |pages=289 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..289P |doi=10.1038/441289a |issn=1476-4687 |pmid=16710401|s2cid=4431143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "clade" is also used with a similar meaning in other fields besides biology, such as [[historical linguistics]]; see [[Cladistics#In disciplines other than biology|Cladistics § In disciplines other than biology]].

==Naming and etymology==
The term "clade" was coined in 1957 by the biologist [[Julian Huxley]] to refer to the result of [[cladogenesis]], the evolutionary splitting of a parent species into two distinct species, a concept Huxley borrowed from [[Bernhard Rensch]].&lt;ref name=Dupuis&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dupuis | first=Claude | year=1984 | title=Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=15 | pages=1–24 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.000245| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J. S. | year =1957 | title = The three types of evolutionary process | journal=Nature | volume=180 | issue = 4584 | pages=454–455 | doi=10.1038/180454a0| bibcode=1957Natur.180..454H | s2cid = 4174182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commonly named groups – [[rodent]]s and [[insect]]s, for example – are clades because, in each case, the group consists of a common ancestor with all its descendant branches. Rodents, for example, are a branch of [[mammal]]s that split off after the end of the period when the clade [[Dinosaur]]ia stopped being the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s 66 million years ago. The original population and all its descendants are a clade. The rodent clade corresponds to the order Rodentia, and insects to the class Insecta. These clades include smaller clades, such as [[chipmunk]] or [[ant]], each of which consists of even smaller clades. The clade "rodent" is in turn included in the mammal, [[vertebrate]] and animal clades.

== History of nomenclature and taxonomy ==
[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|right|upright|Early phylogenetic tree by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1866. Groups once thought to be more advanced, such as birds ("Aves"), are placed at the top.]]

The idea of a clade did not exist in pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[Linnaean taxonomy]], which was based by necessity only on internal or external [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between organisms. Many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (mostly [[vertebrate]] groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of [[convergent evolution]] is responsible for many cases of misleading similarities in the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of groups that evolved from different lineages.

With the increasing realization in the first half of the 19th century that species had changed and split through the ages, classification increasingly came to be seen as branches on the evolutionary [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. The publication of Darwin's [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in 1859 gave this view increasing weight. [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an early advocate of evolutionary theory, proposed a revised taxonomy based on a concept strongly resembling clades,&lt;ref name="original text w/ figures"&gt;Huxley, T.H. (1876): Lectures on Evolution. ''New York Tribune''. Extra. no 36. In Collected Essays IV: pp 46-138 [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE4/LecEvol.html original text w/ figures]&lt;/ref&gt; although the term ''clade'' itself would not be coined until 1957 by his grandson, [[Julian Huxley]]. For example, the elder Huxley grouped birds with reptiles, based on fossil evidence.&lt;ref name="original text w/ figures"/&gt;

German biologist [[Emil Hans Willi Hennig]] (1913–1976) is considered to be the founder of [[cladistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brower, Andrew V. Z.|year=2013|title=Willi Hennig at 100|journal=Cladistics|volume=30|issue=2|pages=224–225|doi=10.1111/cla.12057}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He proposed a classification system that represented repeated branchings of the family tree, as opposed to the previous systems, which put organisms on a "ladder", with supposedly more "advanced" organisms at the top.&lt;ref name="Palmer, Douglas 2009. p. 13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="page 10"&gt;”Evolution 101". [http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 page 10]. Understanding Evolution website. University of California, Berkeley. Retrieved 26 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxonomists have increasingly worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution.&lt;ref name="page 10"/&gt; When it comes to [[Nomenclature#Biology|naming]], this principle is not always compatible with the traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|rank-based nomenclature]] (in which only taxa associated with a [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] can be named) because not enough ranks exist to name a long series of nested clades. For these and other reasons, [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has been developed; it is still controversial.

As an example, see the full current classification of ''[[Anas platyrhynchos]]'' (the mallard duck) with 40 clades from ''[[Eukaryota]]'' down by following [[Wikispecies:Anas _platyrhynchos|this Wikispecies link]] and clicking on "Expand".

The name of a clade is conventionally a plural, where the singular refers to each member individually. A unique exception is the reptile clade [[Dracohors]], which was made by [[haplology]] from Latin "draco" and "cohors", i.e. "the [[dragon]] [[Cohort (disambiguation)|cohort]]"; its form with a suffix added should be e.g. "dracohortian".

==Definition==
[[File:Cladogram Crocodilia NL.PNG|thumb|right|upright|Gavialidae, Crocodylidae and Alligatoridae are clade names that are here applied to a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] tree of crocodylians.]]

A clade is by definition [[monophyletic]], meaning that it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a population, or a species) and all its descendants.&lt;ref group=note&gt;
A semantic case has been made that the name should be "holophyletic", but this term has not acquired widespread use. For more information, see ''[[holophyly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature. Version 4c. Chapter I. Taxa. |url=http://www.ohio.edu/phylocode/art1-3.html|year=2010|access-date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Clades and phylogenetic trees==
{{main|Phylogenetics|Cladistics}}

The science that tries to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and thus discover clades is called [[phylogenetics]] or [[cladistics]], the latter term coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] (1965), derived from "clade". The results of phylogenetic/cladistic analyses are tree-shaped diagrams called ''[[cladogram]]s''; they, and all their branches, are phylogenetic hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Kevin C.|author2=Carpenter, James M.|title=On the Other "Phylogenetic Systematics"|journal=Cladistics|date=1 September 2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x|pmid=34902935|s2cid=73530548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three methods of defining clades are featured in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]: node-, stem-, and apomorphy-based (see [[Phylogenetic nomenclature#Phylogenetic definitions of clade names|Phylogenetic nomenclature§Phylogenetic definitions of clade names]] for detailed definitions).

== Terminology ==
[[File:Primate cladogram.svg|thumb|left|Cladogram of modern primate groups; all tarsiers are haplorhines, but not all haplorhines are tarsiers; all apes are catarrhines, but not all catarrhines are apes; etc.]]
The relationship between clades can be described in several ways:
* A clade located within a clade is said to be ''nested'' within that clade. In the diagram, the [[Ape|hominoid]] clade, i.e. the apes and humans, is nested within the primate clade.
* Two clades are ''[[Sister group|sisters]]'' if they have an immediate common ancestor. In the diagram, lemurs and lorises are sister clades, while humans and tarsiers are not.
* A clade ''A'' is ''[[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]'' to a clade ''B'' if ''A'' branches off the lineage leading to ''B'' before the first branch leading only to members of ''B''. In the adjacent diagram, the [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]]/[[prosimian]] clade, is basal to the [[Hominoidea|hominoids]]/[[ape]] clade. In this example, both Haplorrhine as prosimians should be considered as most basal groupings. It is better to say that the prosimians are the sister group to the rest of the primates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krell |first1=F.-T. |last2=Cranston |first2=P. |year=2004 |title=Which side of the tree is more basal? |journal=Systematic Entomology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=279–281 |doi=10.1111/j.0307-6970.2004.00262.x |s2cid=82371239 |name-list-style=amp }}&lt;/ref&gt; This way one also avoids unintended and misconceived connotations about evolutionary advancement, complexity, diversity, ancestor status, and ancienity e.g. due to impact of sampling diversity and extinction.{{citation needed|reason=reads as editorial comment|date=March 2019}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://for-the-love-of-trees.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-ancestors-are-not-among-us.html|title=For the love of trees: The ancestors are not among us|last=Smith|first=Stacey|date=2016-09-19|website=For the love of trees|access-date=2019-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basal clades should not be confused with stem groupings, as the latter is associated with paraphyletic or unresolved groupings.

=== Age ===
The age of a clade can be described based on two different reference points, [[crown group|crown]] age and stem age. The crown age of a clade refers to the age of the most recent common ancestor of all of the species in the clade. The stem age of a clade refers to the time that the ancestral lineage of the clade diverged from its [[sister group|sister]] clade. A clade's stem age is either the same as or older than its crown age.{{sfn|Harmon|2021}} Note that ages of clades cannot be directly observed. They are inferred, either from [[stratigraphy]] of [[fossil]]s, or from [[molecular clock]] estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, A. V. Z., Schuh, R. T. 2021. Biological Systematics:  Principles and Applications (3rd edn.). Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
''Clade'' is the title of a novel by [[James Bradley (Australian writer)|James Bradley]], who chose it both because of its biological meaning and also because of the larger implications of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@PenguinBooksAus/choosing-the-book-title-clade-f4d16baa6e87 |title=Choosing the Book title 'Clade'|publisher=Penguin Group Australia|year=2015| access-date =20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' is titled "[[List of Elementary episodes#ep38|Dead Clade Walking]]" and deals with a case involving a rare fossil.

{{About||the scientific journal|Cladistics (journal)|phylogenetic nomenclature, often called "cladistic nomenclature" or "cladistic terminology"|Phylogenetic nomenclature}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2020}}

'''Cladistics''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ə|ˈ|d|ɪ|s|t|ɪ|k|s}}; {{etymology|grc|''{{wikt-lang|grc|κλάδος}}'' (kládos)|branch}})&lt;ref name="OnlineEtDict"&gt;{{cite OEtymD|clade}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach to [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] in which [[organism]]s are categorized in groups ("[[clade]]s") based on hypotheses of most recent [[common ancestry]]. The evidence for hypothesized relationships is typically shared [[derived (phylogenetics)|derived]] characteristics ([[synapomorphies]]'')'' that are not present in more distant groups and ancestors. However, from an empirical perspective, common ancestors are inferences based on a cladistic hypothesis of relationships of taxa whose [[Phenotypic trait|character states]] can be observed. Theoretically, a last common ancestor and all its descendants constitute a (minimal) clade. Importantly, all descendants stay in their overarching ancestral clade. For example, if the terms ''worms'' or ''fishes'' were used within a ''strict'' cladistic framework, these terms would include humans. Many of these terms are normally used [[Paraphyly|paraphyletically]], outside of cladistics, e.g. as a '[[Evolutionary grade|grade]]', which  are fruitless to precisely delineate,{{Why|reason=Why is it 'fruitless' to delineate, e.g.,  the prokaryotes, which have a clear definition?|date=April 2022}} especially when including extinct species. [[Evolutionary radiation|Radiation]] results in the generation of new subclades by bifurcation, but in practice sexual hybridization may blur very closely related groupings.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Columbia Encyclopedia{{full citation needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ucmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad1.html |title= Introduction to Cladistics |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |access-date=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ode&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English{{full citation needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{full citation needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a hypothesis, a clade can only be rejected if some groupings were explicitly excluded. It may then be found that the excluded group did actually descend from the last common ancestor of the group, and thus emerged within the group. ("Evolved from" is misleading, because in cladistics all descendants stay in the ancestral group). Upon finding that the group is paraphyletic this way, either such excluded groups should be granted to the clade, or the group should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hickman | first=Cleveland P. Jr. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846846729 |title=Integrated principles of zoology |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-07-352421-4 |edition=Sixteenth |location=New York |oclc=846846729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branches down to the divergence to the next significant (e.g. extant) sister are considered stem-groupings of the clade, but in principle each level stands on its own, to be assigned a unique name. For a fully bifurcated tree, adding a group to a tree also adds an additional (named) clade, and potentially a new level. Specifically, also extinct groups are always put on a side-branch, not distinguishing whether an actual ancestor of other groupings was found.

The techniques and nomenclature of cladistics have been applied to disciplines other than biology.  (See [[phylogenetic nomenclature]].)

Cladistics findings are posing a difficulty for [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], where the rank and (genus-)naming of established groupings may turn out to be inconsistent.

Cladistics is now the most commonly used method to classify organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad5.html|title=The Need for Cladistics|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original methods used in cladistic analysis and the school of taxonomy derived from the work of the German [[entomologist]] [[Willi Hennig]], who referred to it as '''phylogenetic systematics''' (also the title of his 1966 book); the terms "cladistics" and "clade" were popularized by other researchers. Cladistics in the original sense refers to a particular set of methods used in [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis, although it is now sometimes used to refer to the whole field.{{sfn|ps=|Brinkman|Leipe|2001|p=323}}

What is now called the cladistic method appeared as early as 1901 with a work by [[Peter Chalmers Mitchell]] for birds&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Randall. 2000. Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications, p.7 (citing Nelson and Platnick, 1981).

Div. 225-52 (kfolinsb.public.iastate.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently by [[Robert John Tillyard]] (for insects) in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Trees of life: Essays in the philosophy of biology|last = Craw|first = RC|publisher = Kluwer Academic|year = 1992|isbn = 978-94-015-8038-0|location = Dordrecht|pages = 65–107|editor-last = Griffiths|editor-first = PE|chapter = Margins of cladistics: Identity, differences and place in the emergence of phylogenetic systematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Max Zimmerman|W. Zimmermann]] (for plants) in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Randall. 2000. Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications, p.7. Cornell U. Press&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "[[clade]]" was introduced in 1958 by [[Julian Huxley]] after having been coined by [[Lucien Cuénot]] in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cuénot|1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; "cladogenesis" in 1958,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; "cladistic" by [[Arthur Cain]] and Harrison in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cain|Harrison|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; "cladist" (for an adherent of Hennig's school) by [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuis|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "cladistics" in 1966.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Hennig referred to his own approach as "phylogenetic systematics". From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1970s, cladistics competed as an analytical and philosophical approach to systematics with [[phenetics]] and so-called [[evolutionary taxonomy]]. Phenetics was championed at this time by the [[Numerical taxonomy|numerical taxonomists]] [[Peter Sneath]] and [[Robert Sokal]], and evolutionary taxonomy by [[Ernst Mayr]].

Originally conceived, if only in essence, by Willi Hennig in a book published in 1950, cladistics did not flourish until its translation into English in 1966 (Lewin 1997). Today, cladistics is the most popular method for inferring phylogenetic trees from morphological data.

In the 1990s, the development of effective [[polymerase chain reaction]] techniques allowed the application of cladistic methods to [[biochemical]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] traits of organisms, vastly expanding the amount of data available for phylogenetics. At the same time, cladistics rapidly became popular in evolutionary biology, because [[computer]]s made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics.

== Methodology ==
{{Main|Phylogenetics|Cladogram}}
{{See also|Phylogenetic tree}}
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}

The cladistic method interprets each shared character state transformation as a potential piece of evidence for grouping. [[Synapomorphies]] (shared, derived character states) are viewed as evidence of grouping, while [[symplesiomorphies]] (shared ancestral character states) are not.  The outcome of a cladistic analysis is a [[cladogram]] – a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]-shaped diagram ([[dendrogram]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weygoldt|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is interpreted to represent the best hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters and originally calculated by hand, [[DNA sequencing|genetic sequencing]] data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now commonly used in phylogenetic analyses, and the [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] criterion has been abandoned by many phylogeneticists in favor of more "sophisticated" but less parsimonious evolutionary models of character state transformation. Cladists contend that these models are unjustified because there is no evidence that they recover more "true" or "correct" results from actual empirical data sets &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Rindal |first1=Eirik |last2=Brower |first2=Andrew V. Z. |date=2011 |title=Do model-based phylogenetic analyses perform better than parsimony? A test with empirical data |journal=Cladistics |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=331–334|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2010.00342.x |pmid=34875779 |s2cid=84907350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every cladogram is based on a particular dataset analyzed with a particular method. Datasets are tables consisting of [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]], morphological, [[Ethology|ethological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jerison|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or other characters and a list of [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs), which may be genes, individuals, populations, species, or larger taxa that are presumed to be monophyletic and therefore to form, all together, one large clade; phylogenetic analysis infers the branching pattern within that clade. Different datasets and different methods, not to mention violations of the mentioned assumptions, often result in different cladograms. Only scientific investigation can show which is more likely to be correct.

Until recently, for example, cladograms like the following have generally been accepted as accurate representations of the ancestral relations among turtles, lizards, crocodilians, and birds:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |author-link=Michael Benton |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |pages=214, 233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

If this phylogenetic hypothesis is correct, then the last common ancestor of turtles and birds, at the branch near the {{color|LimeGreen|▼}} lived earlier than the last common ancestor of lizards and birds, near the {{font|size=150%|color=OrangeRed|text=♦}}. Most [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular evidence]], however, produces cladograms more like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Lyson |first1=Tyler |last2=Gilbert |first2=Scott F. |date=March–April 2009 |title=Turtles all the way down: loggerheads at the root of the chelonian tree |journal=Evolution &amp; Development |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=133–135 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2009.00325.x |pmid=19245543 |url=http://www.mrfdigs.com/publications/2009_lyson-gilbert-loggerheads.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.mrfdigs.com/publications/2009_lyson-gilbert-loggerheads.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|citeseerx=10.1.1.695.4249 |s2cid=3121166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      }}
   }}
}}

If this is accurate, then the last common ancestor of turtles and birds lived later than the last common ancestor of lizards and birds. Since the cladograms show two mutually exclusive hypotheses to describe the evolutionary history, at most one of them is correct.

[[File:Monophyly, paraphyly, polyphyly.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Cladogram of the [[primate]]s, showing a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] taxon (a [[clade]]: the simians or Anthropoidea, in yellow), a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] taxon (the prosimians, in blue, including the red patch), and a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] taxon (the nocturnal primates – the [[loris]]es and the [[tarsier]]s – in red)]]

The cladogram to the right represents the current universally accepted hypothesis that all [[primate]]s, including [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]] like the [[lemur]]s and [[loris]]es, had a common ancestor all of whose descendants are or were primates, and so form a clade; the name Primates is therefore recognized for this clade. Within the primates, all anthropoids (monkeys, apes, and humans) are hypothesized to have had a common ancestor all of whose descendants are or were anthropoids, so they form the clade called Anthropoidea. The "prosimians", on the other hand, form a paraphyletic taxon. The name Prosimii is not used in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], which names only clades; the "prosimians" are instead divided between the clades [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirhini]] and [[Haplorhini]], where the latter contains Tarsiiformes and Anthropoidea.

Lemurs and tarsiers may have looked closely related to humans, in the sense of being close on the evolutionary tree to humans. However, from the perspective of a tarsier, humans and lemurs would have looked close, in the exact same sense. Cladistics forces a neutral perspective, treating all branches (extant or extinct) in the same manner. It also forces one to try to make statements, and honestly take into account findings, about the exact historic relationships between the groups.

== Terminology for character states ==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}
The following terms, coined by Hennig, are used to identify shared or distinct character states among groups:&lt;ref name="Patterson 1982"&gt;{{harvnb|Patterson|1982|pp=21–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson 1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Pinna 1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Pinna|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|plesiomorphy}} A '''[[plesiomorphy]]''' ("close form") or '''ancestral state''' is a character state that a taxon has retained from its ancestors. When two or more taxa that are not nested within each other share a plesiomorphy, it is a '''symplesiomorphy''' (from ''syn-'', "together"). Symplesiomorphies do not mean that the taxa that exhibit that character state are necessarily closely related. For example, Reptilia is traditionally characterized by (among other things) being [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] (i.e., not maintaining a constant high body temperature), whereas birds are [[Homeothermy|warm-blooded]]. Since cold-bloodedness is a plesiomorphy, inherited from the common ancestor of traditional reptiles and birds, and thus a symplesiomorphy of turtles, snakes and crocodiles (among others), it does not mean that turtles, snakes and crocodiles form a clade that excludes the birds.
* {{anchor|apomorphy}}{{anchor|synapomorphy}} An '''[[apomorphy]]''' ("separate form") or '''derived state''' is an innovation. It can thus be used to diagnose a clade – or even to help define a clade name in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]. Features that are derived in individual taxa (a single species or a group that is represented by a single terminal in a given phylogenetic analysis) are called '''autapomorphies''' (from ''auto-'', "self"). Autapomorphies express nothing about relationships among groups; clades are identified (or defined) by '''synapomorphies''' (from ''syn-'', "together"). For example, the possession of [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] that are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of ''Homo sapiens'' is a synapomorphy within the vertebrates. The [[tetrapod]]s can be singled out as consisting of the first vertebrate with such digits homologous to those of ''Homo sapiens'' together with all descendants of this vertebrate (an apomorphy-based [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definition]]).&lt;ref name="LaurinAnderson2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laurin|Anderson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, snakes and other tetrapods that do not have digits are nonetheless tetrapods: other characters, such as amniotic eggs and diapsid skulls, indicate that they descended from ancestors that possessed digits which are homologous with ours.
* A character state is '''homoplastic''' or "an instance of '''[[homoplasy]]'''" if it is shared by two or more organisms but is absent from their common ancestor or from a later ancestor in the lineage leading to one of the organisms. It is therefore inferred to have evolved by convergence or reversal. Both mammals and birds are able to maintain a high constant body temperature (i.e., they are warm-blooded). However, the accepted cladogram explaining their significant features indicates that their common ancestor is in a group lacking this character state, so the state must have evolved independently in the two clades. Warm-bloodedness is separately a synapomorphy of mammals (or a larger clade) and of birds (or a larger clade), but it is not a synapomorphy of any group including both these clades. Hennig's Auxiliary Principle&lt;ref name="Hennig 1966"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hennig|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that shared character states should be considered evidence of grouping unless they are contradicted by the weight of other evidence; thus, homoplasy of some feature among members of a group may only be inferred after a phylogenetic hypothesis for that group has been established.

The terms plesiomorphy and apomorphy are relative; their application depends on the position of a group within a tree. For example, when trying to decide whether the tetrapods form a clade, an important question is whether having four limbs is a synapomorphy of the earliest taxa to be included within Tetrapoda: did all the earliest members of the Tetrapoda inherit four limbs from a common ancestor, whereas all other vertebrates did not, or at least not homologously? By contrast, for a group within the tetrapods, such as birds, having four limbs is a plesiomorphy. Using these two terms allows a greater precision in the discussion of homology, in particular allowing clear expression of the hierarchical relationships among different homologous features.

It can be difficult to decide whether a character state is in fact the same and thus can be classified as a synapomorphy, which may identify a monophyletic group, or whether it only appears to be the same and is thus a homoplasy, which cannot identify such a group. There is a danger of circular reasoning: assumptions about the shape of a phylogenetic tree are used to justify decisions about character states, which are then used as evidence for the shape of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Pourtless IV|2009|p=25}}: "Synapomorphies are invoked to defend the hypothesis; the hypothesis is invoked to defend the synapomorphies."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics]] uses various forms of [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] to decide such questions; the conclusions reached often depend on the dataset and the methods. Such is the nature of empirical science, and for this reason, most cladists refer to their cladograms as hypotheses of relationship. Cladograms that are supported by a large number and variety of different kinds of characters are viewed as more robust than those based on more limited evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ and Schuh, RT. 2021.  ''Biological Systematics:  Principles and Applications'' (3rd edn.). Cornell University Press, Ithaca nY&lt;/ref&gt;

Mono-, para- and polyphyletic taxa can be understood based on the shape of the tree (as done above), as well as based on their character states.&lt;ref name="Patterson 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de Pinna 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are compared in the table below.

| A paraphyletic assemblage is one that is constructed by taking a clade and removing one or more smaller clades.&lt;ref&gt;Many sources give a verbal definition of 'paraphyletic' that does not require the missing groups to be monophyletic. However, when diagrams are presented representing paraphyletic groups, these invariably show the missing groups as monophyletic. See e.g.{{Harvnb|Wiley|Siegel-Causey|Brooks|Funk|1991|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Removing one clade produces a singly paraphyletic assemblage, removing two produces a doubly paraphylectic assemblage, and so on.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| A paraphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''plesiomorphies''': character states inherited from ancestors but not present in all of their descendants. As a consequence, a paraphyletic assemblage is truncated, in that it excludes one or more clades from an otherwise monophyletic taxon. An alternative name is ''[[evolutionary grade]]'', referring to an ancestral character state within the group. While paraphyletic assemblages are popular among paleontologists and evolutionary taxonomists, cladists do not recognize paraphyletic assemblages as having any formal information content – they are merely parts of clades.

| [[Polyphyly]]
| A polyphyletic assemblage is one which is neither monophyletic nor paraphyletic.
| A polyphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''[[Homoplasy|homoplasies]]''': character states which have converged or reverted so as to be the same but which have not been inherited from a common ancestor. No systematist recognizes polyphyletic assemblages as taxonomically meaningful entities, although ecologists sometimes consider them meaningful labels for functional participants in ecological communities (e. g., primary producers, detritivores, etc.).

== Criticism ==

Cladistics, either generally or in specific applications, has been criticized from its beginnings. Decisions as to whether particular character states are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]], a precondition of their being synapomorphies, have been challenged as involving [[circular reasoning]] and subjective judgements.&lt;ref name="AdraEdgeLieb02"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adrain|Edgecombe|Lieberman|2002|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the potential unreliability of evidence is a problem for any systematic method, or for that matter, for any empirical scientific endeavor at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Oreskes|Oreskes, Naomi]], Kristin Shrader-Frechette, and Kenneth Belitz. "Verification, validation, and confirmation of numerical models in the earth sciences." Science 263, no. 5147 (1994): 641-646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Nils Møller Anderson, 2001 The impact of W. Hennig’s “phylogenetic systematics” on contemporary entomology ''Eur. J.Entomol. 98: 133-150'' [https://www.eje.cz/pdfs/eje/2001/02/02.pdf online] &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transformed cladistics]] arose in the late 1970s &lt;ref&gt;Platnick, Norman I. "Philosophy and the transformation of cladistics." Systematic Zoology 28, no. 4 (1979): 537-546.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to resolve some of these problems by removing a priori assumptions about phylogeny from cladistic analysis, but it has remained unpopular.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, Andrew VZ. "Fifty shades of cladism." Biology &amp; Philosophy 33, no. 1-2 (2018): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Ancestors ===
The cladistic method does not identify fossil species as actual ancestors of a clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krell|first1=Frank-T|last2=Cranston|first2=Peter S.|date=2004|title=Which side of the tree is more basal?: Editorial|journal=Systematic Entomology|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=279–281|doi=10.1111/j.0307-6970.2004.00262.x|s2cid=82371239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, fossil taxa are identified as belonging to separate extinct branches. While a fossil species could be the actual ancestor of a clade, there is no way to know that.  Therefore, a more conservative hypothesis is that the fossil taxon is related to other fossil and extant taxa, as implied by the pattern of shared apomorphic features.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Colin. "Significance of fossils in determining evolutionary relationships." Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 12, no. 1 (1981): 195-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extinction status ===
An otherwise extinct group with any extant descendants, is not considered (literally) extinct,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ross |first1=Robert M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gw3vHelHbusC&amp;dq=paraphyly+can+not+be+precisely+extinction&amp;pg=PA133 |title=Causes of Evolution: A Paleontological Perspective |last2=Allmon |first2=Warren D. |date=1990-12-18 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-72824-7 |pages=133 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for instance does not have a date of extinction.

=== Hybridization, interbreeding ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2022}}
Anything having to do with biology and sex is complicated and messy, and cladistics is no exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Introduction to Cladistics |url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad1.html |access-date=2022-05-08 |website=ucmp.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species reproduce sexually, and are capable of interbreeding for millions of years. Worse, during such a period, many branches may have radiated, and it may take hundreds of millions of years for them to have whittled down to just two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=Richard G. |last2=Larson |first2=Erica L. |date=2014-01-01 |title=Hybridization, Introgression, and the Nature of Species Boundaries |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esu033 |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=105 |issue=S1 |pages=795–809 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esu033 |pmid=25149255 |issn=0022-1503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only then one can theoretically assign proper last common ancestors of groupings which do not inadvertently include earlier branches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hörandl |first1=Elvira |last2=Stuessy |first2=Tod F. |date=2010 |title=Paraphyletic groups as natural units of biological classification |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41059863 |journal=Taxon |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=1641–1653 |doi=10.1002/tax.596001 |jstor=41059863 |issn=0040-0262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of true cladistic bifurcation can thus take a much more extended time than one is usually aware of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mehta |first1=Rohan S. |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Noah A. |date=2019-10-01 |title=The probability of reciprocal monophyly of gene lineages in three and four species |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |language=en |volume=129 |pages=133–147 |doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2018.04.004|pmid=29729946 |pmc=6215533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, for recent radiations, cladistically guided findings only give a coarse impression of the complexity. A more detailed account will give details about fractions of introgressions between groupings, and even geographic variations thereof. This has been used as an argument for the use of paraphyletic  groupings,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but typically other reasons are quoted.

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2022}}
Horizontal gene transfer is the mobility of genetic info between different organisms that can have immediate or delayed effects for the reciprocal host &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Emamalipour |first1=Melissa |last2=Seidi |first2=Khaled |last3=Zununi Vahed |first3=Sepideh |last4=Jahanban-Esfahlan |first4=Ali |last5=Jaymand |first5=Mehdi |last6=Majdi |first6=Hasan |last7=Amoozgar |first7=Zohreh |last8=Chitkushev |first8=L. T. |last9=Javaheri |first9=Tahereh |last10=Jahanban-Esfahlan |first10=Rana |last11=Zare |first11=Peyman |date=2020 |title=Horizontal Gene Transfer: From Evolutionary Flexibility to Disease Progression |journal=Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology |volume=8 |page=229 |doi=10.3389/fcell.2020.00229 |pmid=32509768 |pmc=7248198 |issn=2296-634X|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;.There are several processes in nature which can cause [[horizontal gene transfer]]. This does typically not directly interfere with ancestry of the organism, but can complicate the determination of that ancestry. On another level, one can map the horizontal gene transfer processes, by determining the phylogeny of the individual genes using cladistics.

=== Naming stability ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2022}}
If there is unclarity in mutual relationships, there are a lot of possible trees. Assigning names to each possible clade may not be prudent. Furthermore, established names are discarded in cladistics, or alternatively carry connotations which may no longer hold, such as when additional groups are found to have emerged in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dubois |first=Alain |date=2007-08-01 |title=Naming taxa from cladograms: some confusions, misleading statements, and necessary clarifications |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2007.00151.x |journal=Cladistics |language=en |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=390–402 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2007.00151.x |pmid=34905840 |s2cid=59437223 |issn=0748-3007}}&lt;/ref&gt; E.g.  Archaea, Asgard archaea, protists, slime molds, worms, invertebrata, fishes, reptilia, monkeys, ''Ardipithecus'', ''Australopithecus'', ''Homo erectus'' all contain ''Homo sapiens'' cladistically in their ''sensu lato'' meaning.

== In disciplines other than biology ==
The comparisons used to acquire data on which [[cladograms]] can be based are not limited to the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Clare|Shennan|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any group of individuals or classes that are hypothesized to have a common ancestor, and to which a set of common characteristics may or may not apply, can be compared pairwise. Cladograms can be used to depict the hypothetical descent relationships within groups of items in many different academic realms. The only requirement is that the items have characteristics that can be identified and measured.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropology]] and [[archaeology]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipo|O'Brien|Collard|Shennan|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the development of cultures or artifacts using groups of cultural traits or artifact features.

[[Comparative mythology]] and [[Folklore|folktale]] use cladistic methods to reconstruct the protoversion of many myths. Mythological phylogenies constructed with mythemes clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes Palaeolithic) diffusions and punctuated evolution.&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012a, b; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d&lt;/ref&gt; They also are a powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Ross and al. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Literature]]: Cladistic methods have been used in the classification of the surviving manuscripts of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canterbury Tales Project |url=http://www.canterburytalesproject.org |access-date=2009-07-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707103441/http://www.canterburytalesproject.org/ |archive-date=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the manuscripts of the Sanskrit ''[[Charaka Samhita]]''.&lt;ref name="Maas 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maas|2010–2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historical linguistics]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|pp=290–300, 340–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of languages using linguistic features. This is similar to the traditional [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] of historical linguistics, but is more explicit in its use of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] and allows much faster analysis of large datasets ([[computational phylogenetics]]).

[[Textual criticism]] or [[stemmatics]]:&lt;ref name="Maas 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|O’Hara|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of manuscripts of the same work (and reconstruct the lost original) using distinctive copying errors as apomorphies. This differs from traditional historical-comparative linguistics in enabling the editor to evaluate and place in genetic relationship large groups of manuscripts with large numbers of variants that would be impossible to handle manually. It also enables [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] analysis of contaminated traditions of transmission that would be impossible to evaluate manually in a reasonable period of time.

[[Astrophysics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraix-Burnet|Choler|Douzery|Verhamme|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; infers the history of relationships between galaxies to create branching diagram hypotheses of galaxy diversification.

[[File:OWT Clarke medal reverse.jpg|thumb|200px|Clarke Medal]]
The '''Clarke Medal''' is awarded by the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]], the oldest [[learned society]] in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere, for distinguished work in the [[Natural science]]s.&lt;ref name=RSNSW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalsoc.org.au/awards/clarke-medal|title=Clarke Medal
 |publisher=Royal Society of New South Wales |access-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medal is named in honour of the [[William Branwhite Clarke|Reverend William Branwhite Clarke]], one of the founders of the Society and was to be ''"awarded for meritorious contributions to [[Geology]], [[Mineralogy]] and [[Natural History]] of [[Australasia]], to be open to men of science, whether resident in Australasia or elsewhere"''.

It is now awarded annually for distinguished work in the Natural Sciences (geology, [[botany]] and [[zoology]]) done in the Australian Commonwealth and its territories. Each discipline is considered in rotation every three years.

{{Biological classification}}

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], '''class''' ({{lang-la|classis}}) is  a [[taxonomic rank]], as well as a taxonomic unit, a [[taxon]], in that rank. It is a group of related taxonomic orders.{{efn|When the term denotes taxonomic units, the plural is classes (Latin ''classes'').}} Other well-known ranks in descending order of size are [[life]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]], with class fitting between phylum and order.

==History==
The class as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name (and not just called a ''top-level genus'' ''(genus summum)'') was first introduced by the [[France|French]] [[botanist]] [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in his classification of plants that appeared in his ''Eléments de botanique'', 1694.

Insofar as a general definition of a class is available, it has historically been conceived as embracing taxa that combine a distinct ''grade'' of organization—i.e. a 'level of complexity', measured in terms of how differentiated their organ systems are into distinct regions or sub-organs—with a distinct ''type'' of construction, which is to say a particular layout of organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Thomas Henry |author-link=Thomas Huxley |editor1-last=Henfrey |editor1-first=Arthur |title=Scientific memoirs, selected from the transactions of foreign academies of science, and from foreign journals. Natural history |year=1853 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.28029 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/70597#page/186/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This said, the composition of each class is ultimately determined by the subjective judgment of [[taxonomist]]s. Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists taking different positions. There are no objective rules for describing a class, but for well-known animals there is likely to be consensus. 

In the first edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr E.]] (1982). ''The Growth of Biological Thought''. Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-36446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] divided all three of his [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of Nature ([[mineral]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s) into classes. Only in the animal kingdom are Linnaeus's classes similar to the classes used today; his classes and orders of plants were never intended to represent natural groups, but rather to provide a convenient "artificial key" according to his ''[[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification of plants|Systema Sexuale]]'', largely based on the arrangement of flowers. In botany, classes are now rarely discussed. Since the first publication of the [[APG system]] in 1998, which proposed a taxonomy of the [[flowering plant]]s up to the level of orders, many sources have preferred to treat ranks higher than orders as informal [[clade]]s. Where formal ranks have been assigned, the ranks have been reduced to a very much lower level, e.g. class Equisitopsida for the land plants, with the major divisions within the class assigned to subclasses and superorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=Mark W. |last2=Reveal |first2=James L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x |name-list-style=amp |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The class was considered the highest level of the taxonomic hierarchy until [[George Cuvier]]'s ''embranchements'', first called [[Phylum|Phyla]] by [[Ernst Haeckel]],&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A.G., Valentine, J.W. (2001). [http://si-pddr.si.edu/jspui/bitstream/10088/7403/1/Collins_Valentine_EvDev2001.pdf "Defining phyla: evolutionary pathways to metazoan body plans"]. ''Evol. Dev''. '''3''': 432-442.&lt;/ref&gt; were introduced in the early nineteenth century.

[[File:AP_Biology_-_Primary_Succession_Drawing.svg|thumb|356x356px|An image of ecological succession, starting with pioneer species and ending with an old-growth forest that is dominated by climax species, which is denoted by VIII.]]

Climax species, also called '''late [[Sere (ecology)|seral]]''', '''late-successional''', '''[[K-selected]]''' or '''equilibrium''' species, are [[plant]] [[species]] that can germinate and grow with limited resources; e.g., they need heat exposure or low water availability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Shimano K |date=2000-02-01|title=A power function for forest structure and regeneration pattern of pioneer and climax species in patch mosaic forests  |journal=Plant Ecology |language=en |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=205–218 |doi=10.1023/A:1009867302660 |s2cid=275790 |issn=1573-5052}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the species within [[Ecological succession|forest succession]] that are more adapted to stable and predictable environments, and will remain essentially unchanged in terms of species composition for as long as a site remains undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wehenkel C, Bergmann F, Gregorius HR  |date=2006-07-01 |title=Is there a trade-off between species diversity and genetic diversity in forest tree communities?  |journal=Plant Ecology |language=en |volume=185 |issue=1 |pages=151–161 |doi=10.1007/s11258-005-9091-2 |s2cid=20085178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Seedling|seedlings]] of climax species can grow in the shade of the parent trees, ensuring their dominance indefinitely. The presence of climax species can also reduce the prevalence of other species  within an ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Do HT, Grant JC, Zimmer HC, Trinh BN, Nichols JD | title = Site conditions for regeneration of climax species, the key for restoring moist deciduous tropical forest in Southern Vietnam | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = e0233524 | date = 2020-05-29 | pmid = 32469962 | pmc = 7259571 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0233524 | bibcode = 2020PLoSO..1533524D | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], such as fire, may kill the climax species, allowing [[Pioneer species|pioneer]] or earlier successional species to re-establish for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Wehenkel C, Bergmann F, Gregorius HR |date=2006-07-01|title=Is there a trade-off between species diversity and genetic diversity in forest tree communities? |journal=Plant Ecology |language=en |volume=185 |issue=1 |pages=151–161 |doi=10.1007/s11258-005-9091-2 |s2cid=20085178 |issn=1573-5052}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the opposite of [[pioneer species]], also known as [[Ruderal species|ruderal]], fugitive, opportunistic or [[R-selected]] species, in the sense that climax species are good competitors but poor colonizers, whereas pioneer species are good colonizers but poor competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown S, Dockery J, Pernarowski M | title = Traveling wave solutions of a reaction diffusion model for competing pioneer and climax species | journal = Mathematical Biosciences | volume = 194 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–36 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15836862 | doi = 10.1016/j.mbs.2004.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Given the prevailing ecological conditions, climax species dominate the [[climax community]]. When the pace of succession slows down as the result of [[ecological homeostasis]], the maximum permitted [[biodiversity]] is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ernest SK | chapter = Homeostasis|date= January 2008 | title = Encyclopedia of Ecology|pages=1879–1884| veditors = Jørgensen SE, Fath BD |place=Oxford|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-008045405-4.00507-3|isbn=978-0-08-045405-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reproductive strategies and other adaptive characteristics can be considered more sophisticated than those of opportunistic species.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Shimano K |date=2000-02-01|title=A power function for forest structure and regeneration pattern of pioneer and climax species in patch mosaic forests |journal=Plant Ecology|language=en|volume=146|issue=2|pages=205–218|doi=10.1023/A:1009867302660|s2cid=275790|issn=1573-5052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[negative feedback]], they adapt themselves to specific environmental conditions. Climax species are mostly found in forests. Climax species, closely controlled by [[carrying capacity]], follow [[K strategy|K strategies]], wherein species produce fewer numbers of potential offspring, but invest more heavily in securing the reproductive success of each one to the micro-environmental conditions of its specific [[ecological niche]].  Climax species might be [[Semelparity and Iteroparity|iteroparous]], [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption efficient]] and [[Biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McShaffrey D | publisher = Marietta College | url = http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html | title = Relationships Among Species | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090616010027/http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html | archive-date = 16 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed term==
The idea of a climax species has been criticized in recent ecological literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/doaklab/timberland/timberland/results.htm Results, Analysis of Timberland Owned by San Jose Water Company] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617032242/http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/doaklab/timberland/timberland/results.htm |date=2013-06-17 }} 2007-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;  Any assessment of successional states depends on assumptions about the natural fire regime.  But the idea of a dominant species is still widely used in [[Silviculture|silvicultural]] programs and [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|California Department of Forestry]] literature.

==Examples==

[[Picea glauca|White spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') is an example of a climax species in the northern forests of North America due to its ability to adapt to resource scarce, stable conditions, it dominates Northern forest ecosystem in the absence of a disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Picea glauca|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/picgla/all.html|access-date=2020-12-03|website=www.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], a '''cline''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κλίνειν ''klinein'', meaning "to lean") is a measurable [[gradient]] in a single character (or biological trait) of a species across its [[Range (biology)|geographical range]].&lt;ref name="Huxley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=Julian|title=Clines: an Auxiliary Taxonomic Principle|journal=Nature|date=30 July 1938|volume=142|issue=3587|pages=219–220|doi=10.1038/142219a0|bibcode=1938Natur.142..219H|s2cid=4124055}}&lt;/ref&gt; First coined by [[Julian Huxley]] in 1938, the "character" of the cline referred to is usually genetic (e.g. [[allele frequency]], [[blood type]]), or phenotypic (e.g. body size, skin pigmentation). Clines can show smooth, continuous gradation in a character, or they may show more abrupt changes in the trait from one geographic region to the next.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

A cline refers to a spatial gradient in a specific, singular trait, rather than a collection of traits;&lt;ref name= "Huxley biography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dronamraju|first1=Krishna R.|last2=Needham|first2=Joseph|title=If I Am To Be Remembered: Correspondence Of Julian Huxley|date=1993|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrLsCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=continuous+discontinuous+clines&amp;pg=PT195|isbn=9789814505192}}&lt;/ref&gt; a single population can therefore have as many clines as it has traits, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Forest genetics" /&gt; Additionally, Huxley recognised that these multiple independent clines may not act in concordance with each other. For example, it has been observed that in Australia, birds generally become smaller the further towards the north of the country they are found. In contrast, the intensity of their plumage colouration follows a different geographical trajectory, being most vibrant where humidity is highest and becoming less vibrant further into the arid centre of the country.&lt;ref name= "Mayr1963"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Populations, species, and evolution: an abridgment of Animal species and evolution|date=1963|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/animalspeciesevo00mayr|url-access=registration|access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because of this, clines were defined by Huxley as being an "auxiliary taxonomic principle"; that is, clinal variation in a species is not awarded taxonomic recognition in the way [[subspecies]] or [[species]] are.&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

While the terms "[[ecotype]]" and "cline" are sometimes used interchangeably, they do in fact differ in that "ecotype" refers to a population which differs from other populations in a number of characters, rather than the single character that varies amongst populations in a cline.&lt;ref name="Forest genetics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Timothy L.|last2=Adams|first2=W. T.|last3=Neale|first3=David B.|title=Forest Genetics|date=2007|publisher=CABI Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHZCeg4BqtkC&amp;q=ecotypes+and+clines&amp;pg=PA190|access-date=28 March 2018|isbn=9781845932862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers and the evolution of clines==
[[File:Gene flow (butterflies).svg|thumb|upright=1|Two populations with individuals moving between the populations to demonstrate gene flow]]
Clines are often cited to be the result of two opposing drivers: [[Natural selection|selection]] and [[gene flow]] (also known as migration).&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; Selection causes [[adaptation]] to the local environment, resulting in different genotypes or phenotypes being favoured in different environments. This diversifying force is countered by gene flow, which has a homogenising effect on populations and prevents [[speciation]] through causing [[genetic admixture]] and blurring any distinct genetic boundaries.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt;

===Development of clines===
Clines are generally thought to arise under one of two conditions: "primary differentiation" (also known as "primary contact" or "primary intergradation"), or "secondary contact" (also known as "secondary introgression", or "secondary intergradation").&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayr1942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

====Primary differentiation====
[[File:Final Primary Differentiation.svg|thumb|upright=1|Primary differentiation is demonstrated using the peppered moth as an example, with a change in an environmental variable such as sooty coverage of trees imposing a selective pressure on a previously uniformly coloured moth population. This causes the frequency of melanic morphs to increase the more soot there is on vegetation.]]
Clines produced through this way are generated by spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions. The mechanism of selection acting upon organisms is therefore external. Species ranges frequently span environmental gradients (e.g. humidity, rainfall, temperature, or day length) and, according to natural selection, different environments will favour different [[genotype]]s or [[phenotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles R.|title=On the Origin of Species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life|url=https://archive.org/details/onoriginofspec00darw|date=1859|publisher=London: John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, when previously genetically or phenotypically uniform populations spread into novel environments, they will evolve to be uniquely adapted to the local environment, in the process potentially creating a gradient in a genotypic or phenotypic trait.

Such clines in characters can not be maintained through selection alone if much gene flow occurred between populations, as this would tend to swamp out the effects of local adaptation. However, because species usually tend to have a limited dispersal range (e.g. in an [[isolation by distance]] model), restricted gene flow can serve as a type of barrier which encourages geographic differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Sewall|title=Isolation by Distance|journal=Genetics|date=1943|volume=28|issue=2|pages=114–138|doi=10.1093/genetics/28.2.114|pmc=1209196|pmid=17247074}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some degree of migration is often required to maintain a cline; without it, [[speciation]] is likely to eventually occur, as local adaptation can cause reproductive isolation between populations.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

A classic example of the role of environmental gradients in creating clines is that of the peppered moth, [[Peppered moth|''Biston betularia'']], in the UK. During the 19th century, when the industrial sector gained traction, coal emissions blackened vegetation across northwest England and parts of northern Wales. As a result of this, lighter [[morph (zoology)|morph]]s of the moth were more visible to predators against the blackened tree trunks and were therefore more heavily predated relative to the darker morphs. Consequently, the frequency of the more [[Crypsis|cryptic]] melanic morph of the peppered moth increased drastically in northern England. This cline in morph colour, from a dominance of lighter morphs in the west of England (which did not suffer as heavily from pollution), to the higher frequency of melanic forms in the north, has slowly been degrading since limitations to sooty emissions were introduced in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saccheri|first1=Illik J.|last2=Rousset|first2=Francois|last3=Watts|first3=Phillip C.|last4=Brakefield|first4=Paul M.|last5=Cook|first5=Laurence M.|title=Selection and gene flow on a diminishing cline of melanic peppered moths|journal=PNAS|date=2008|volume=105|issue=42|pages=16212–16217|doi=10.1073/pnas.0803785105 |pmid=18854412|pmc=2571026|bibcode=2008PNAS..10516212S|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secondary contact====
{{main|Secondary contact}}
[[File:Secondary Introgression.svg|thumb|upright=1|Secondary contact between two previously isolated populations. Two previously isolated populations establish contact and therefore gene flow, creating an intermediate zone in the phenotypic or genotypic character between the two populations.]] 
Clines generated through this mechanism have arisen through the joining of two formerly isolated populations which differentiated in [[allopatric speciation|allopatry]], creating an intermediate zone. This secondary contact scenario may occur, for example, when climatic conditions change, allowing the ranges of populations to expand and meet.&lt;ref name="Mayr1942" /&gt; Because over time the effect of gene flow will tend to eventually swamp out any regional differences and cause one large homogenous population, for a stable cline to be maintained when two populations join there must usually be a selective pressure maintaining a degree of differentiation between the two populations.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

The mechanism of selection maintaining the clines in this scenario is often intrinsic. This means that the fitness of individuals is independent of the external environment, and selection is instead dependent on the genome of the individual. Intrinsic, or endogenous, selection can give rise to clines in characters through a variety of mechanisms. One way it may act is through [[Underdominance|heterozygote disadvantage]], in which intermediate genotypes have a lower relative fitness than either homozygote genotypes. Because of this disadvantage, one allele will tend to become fixed in a given population, such that populations will consist largely of either ''AA'' ([[homozygote|homozygous]] dominant) or ''aa'' (homozygous recessive) individuals.&lt;ref name="Bazykin1969"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazykin|first1=A. D.|title=Hypothetical Mechanism of Speciation|journal=Evolution|date=1969|volume=23|issue=4|pages=685–687|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1969.tb03550.x|pmid=28562864|jstor=2406862|s2cid=33832575|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cline of hetero[[zygote]]s that is created when these respective populations come into contact is then shaped by the opposing forces of selection and gene flow; even if selection against heterozygotes is great, if there is some degree of gene flow between the two populations, then a steep cline may be able to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Benjamin M.|title=Alternative forms for genomic clines|journal=Ecology and Evolution|date=July 2013|volume=3|issue=7|pages=1951–1966|doi=10.1002/ece3.609|pmid=23919142|pmc=3728937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Richard G.|title=Hybrid Zones and the Evolutionary Process|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFJFkVKskYIC&amp;q=frequency+dependent+selection+clines&amp;pg=PA17|access-date=17 April 2018|isbn=9780195069174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because instrinsic selection is independent of the external environment, clines generated by selection against hybrids are not fixed to any given geographical area and can move around the geographic landscape.&lt;ref name="EoE" /&gt; Such [[hybrid zone]]s where hybrids are a disadvantage relative to their parental lines (but which are nonetheless maintained through selection being counteracted by gene flow) are known as "tension zones".&lt;ref name="Bazykin1969" /&gt;

Another way in which selection can generate clines is through [[frequency-dependent selection]]. Characters that could be maintained by such frequency-dependent selective pressures include warning signals ([[aposematism]]). For example, aposematic signals in ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies sometimes display steep clines between populations, which are maintained through [[Frequency-dependent selection#Positive|positive frequency dependence]].&lt;ref name="Richard1993" /&gt; This is because heterozygosity, [[mutation]]s and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] can all produce patterns that deviate from those well-established signals which mark prey as being unpalatable. These individuals are then predated more heavily relative to their counterparts with "normal" markings (i.e. selected against), creating populations dominated by a particular pattern of warning signal. As with heterozygote disadvantage, when these populations join, a narrow cline of intermediate individuals could be produced, maintained by gene flow counteracting selection.&lt;ref name="Richard1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mallet|first1=James|last2=Barton|first2=Nicholas H.|title=Strong natural selection in a warning-colour hybrid zone|journal=Evolution|date=1989|volume=43|issue=2|pages=421–431|jstor=2409217|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb04237.x |pmid=28568556|s2cid=15899619|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary contact could lead to a cline with a steep gradient if heterozygote disadvantage or frequency-dependent selection exists, as intermediates are heavily selected against. Alternatively, steep clines could exist because the populations have only recently established secondary contact, and the character in the original allopatric populations had a large degree of differentiation. As genetic admixture between the population increases with time however, the steepness of the cline is likely to decrease as the difference in character is eroded. However, if the character in the original allopatric populations was not very differentiated to begin with, the cline between the populations need not display a very steep gradient.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; Because both primary differentiation and secondary contact can therefore give rise to similar or identical clinal patterns (e.g. gently sloping clines), distinguishing which of these two processes is responsible for generating a cline is difficult and often impossible.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; However, in some circumstances a cline and a geographic variable (such as humidity) may be very tightly linked, with a change in one corresponding closely to a change in the other. In such cases it may be tentatively concluded that the cline is generated by primary differentiation and therefore moulded by environmental selective pressures.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

====No selection (drift/migration balance)====
While selection can therefore clearly play a key role in creating clines, it is theoretically feasible that they might be generated by [[genetic drift]] alone. It is unlikely that large-scale clines in genotype or phenotype frequency will be produced solely by drift. However, across smaller geographical scales and in smaller populations, drift could produce temporary clines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Futuyma|first1=Douglas|title=Evolution|url=https://archive.org/details/evolution0000futu|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=9780878931873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that drift is a weak force upholding the cline however means that clines produced this way are often random (i.e. uncorrelated with environmental variables) and subject to breakdown or reversal over time.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; Such clines are therefore unstable and sometimes called "transient clines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polechová|first1=Jitka|last2=Barton|first2=Nick|title=Genetic Drift Widens the Expected Cline but Narrows the Expected Cline Width|journal=Genetics|date=September 2011|volume=189|issue=1|pages=227–235|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.129817|pmid=21705747|pmc=3176109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinal structure and terminology==
[[File:Character-Cline Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1|Clinal characters change from one end of the geographic range to another. The extent of this change is reflected in the slope of the cline.]]
The steepness, or gradient, of a cline reflects the extent of the differentiation in the character across a geographic range.&lt;ref name="Endler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Endler|first1=John A.|title=Geographic Variation, Speciation, and Clines|journal=Monographs in Population Biology|date=1977|volume=10|pages=1–246|publisher=Princeton University Press|pmid=409931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BL12fYUMobwC&amp;q=rassenkreis+cline|isbn=978-0691081922}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a steep cline could indicate large variation in the colour of plumage between adjacent bird populations. It has been previously outlined that such steep clines may be the result of two previously allopatric populations with a large degree of difference in the trait having only recently established gene flow, or where there is strong selection against hybrids. However, it may also reflect a sudden environmental change or boundary. Examples of rapidly changing environmental boundaries like this include abrupt changes in the heavy metal content of soils, and the consequent narrow clines produced between populations of ''[[Agrostis]]'' that are either adapted to these soils with high metal content, or adapted to "normal" soil.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain|first1=S K|last2=Bradshaw|first2=A D|title=Evolutionary divergence among adjacent plant populations I. The evidence and its theoretical analysis|journal=Heredity|date=1 August 1966|volume=21|issue=3|pages=407–441|doi=10.1038/hdy.1966.42|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a shallow cline indicates little geographical variation in the character or trait across a given geographical distance. This may have arisen through weak differential environmental selective pressure, or where two populations established secondary contact a long time ago and gene flow has eroded the large character differentiation between the populations.

The gradient of a cline is related to another commonly referred to property, clinal width. A cline with a steep slope is said to have a small, or narrow, width, while shallower clines have larger widths.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Numerical Taxonomy|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW7tCAAAQBAJ&amp;q=cline+slope+steepness|isbn=9783642690242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of clines==
[[File:Clinal Variation by Huxley.svg|thumb|upright=1|Categories and subcategories of clines, as defined by Huxley]]
According to Huxley, clines can be classified into two categories; continuous clines and discontinuous stepped clines.&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt; These types of clines characterise the way that a genetic or phenotypic trait transforms from one end of its geographical range of the species to the other.

===Continuous clines===
In continuous clines, all populations of the species are able to interbreed and there is gene flow throughout the entire range of the species. In this way, these clines are both biologically (no clear subgroups) and geographically (contiguous distribution) continuous. 
Continuous clines can be further sub-divided into smooth and stepped clines. 
*Continuous smooth clines are characterised by the lack of any abrupt changes or delineation in the genetic or phenotypic trait across the cline, instead displaying a smooth gradation throughout. Huxley recognised that this type of cline, with its uniform slope throughout, was unlikely to be common. 
*Continuous stepped clines consist of an overall shallow cline, interspersed by sections of much steeper slope. The shallow slope represents the populations, and the shorter, steeper sections the larger change in character between populations.&lt;ref name="hedrick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hedrick|first1=Philip|title=Genetics of Populations|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stepped clines can be further subdivided into horizontally stepped clines, and obliquely stepped clines. 
**Horizontally stepped clines show no intra-population variation or gradation in the character, therefore displaying a horizontal gradient. These uniform populations are connected by steeper sections of the cline, characterised by larger changes in the form of the character. However, because in continuous clines all populations exchange genetic material, the intergradation zone between the groups can never have a vertical slope.&lt;ref name="hedrick" /&gt; 
**In obliquely stepped clines, conversely, each population also demonstrates a cline in the character, albeit of a shallower slope than the clines connecting the populations together. Huxley compared obliquely stepped clines to looking like a "stepped ramp", rather than taking on the formation of a staircase as in the case of horizontally stepped clines.&lt;ref name="Huxley biography" /&gt;

===Discontinuous stepped clines===
Unlike in continuous clines, in discontinuous clines the populations of species are allopatric, meaning there is very little or no gene flow amongst populations. The genetic or phenotypic trait in question always shows a steeper gradient between groups than within groups, as in continuous clines. Discontinuous clines follow the same principles as continuous clines by displaying either
*Horizontally stepped clines, where intra-group variation is very small or non-existent and the geographic space separating groups shows a sharp change in character
*Obliquely stepped clines, where there is some intra-group gradation, but this is less than the gradation in the character between populations&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

==Clines and speciation==
[[File:Parapatric Speciation Schematic.svg|thumb|upright=1|[[Parapatric speciation]]]]
It was originally assumed that geographic isolation was a necessary precursor to speciation ([[allopatric speciation]]).&lt;ref name="Mayr1942"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species from the viewpoint of a zoologist|url=https://archive.org/details/systematicsorigi0000mayr_p8z7|url-access=registration|date=1942|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that clines may be a precursor to speciation was therefore ignored, as they were assumed to be evidence of the fact that in contiguous populations gene flow was too strong a force of homogenisation, and selection too weak a force of differentiation, for speciation to take place.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; However, the existence of particular types of clines, such as [[ring species]], in which populations did not differentiate in allopatry but the terminal ends of the cline nonetheless do not interbreed, cast into doubt whether complete geographical isolation of populations is an absolute requirement for speciation.

Because clines can exist in populations connected by some degree of gene flow, the generation of new species from a previously clinal population is termed [[parapatric speciation]]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic selection can serve to generate varying degrees of [[reproductive isolation]] and thereby instigate the process of [[speciation]]. For example, through environmental selection acting on populations and favouring particular allele frequencies, large genetic differences between populations may accumulate (this would be reflected in clinal structure by the presence of numerous very steep clines). If the local genetic differences are great enough, it may lead unfavourable combinations of genotypes and therefore to hybrids being at a decreased fitness relative to the parental lines. When this hybrid disadvantage is great enough, natural selection will select for [[Reproductive isolation#Pre-zygotic isolation|pre-zygotic]] traits in the homozygous parental lines that reduce the likelihood of disadvantageous hybridisation - in other words, natural selection will favour traits that promote assortative mating in the parental lines.&lt;ref name="EoE"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jorgensen|first1=Sven|last2=Fath|first2=Brian|title=Encyclopaedia of Ecology|date=2014|publisher=Newnes|isbn = 9780080914565}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]] and plays an important role in parapatric and [[sympatric speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coyne|first1=Jerry A.|last2=Orr|first2=H. Allen|title=Speciation|date=2004|publisher=Sinauer|isbn = 9780878930890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

==Clinal maps==
Clines can be portrayed graphically on maps using lines that show the transition in character state from one end of the geographic range to the other. Character states can however additionally be represented using isophenes, defined by Ernst Mayr as "lines of equal expression of a clinally varying character".&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; In other words, areas on maps that demonstrate the same biological phenomenon or character will be connected by something that resembles a contour line. When mapping clines therefore, which follow a character gradation from one extreme to the other, isophenes will transect clinal lines at a right angle.

==Examples of clines==
[[File:Northern red fox &amp; southern desert red fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Bergmann's Rule demonstrated showing the difference in size between a larger northern fox, whose range spans colder regions, and a smaller desert fox, whose range is primarily in hot regions]]
Although the term "cline" was first officially coined by Huxley in 1938, gradients and geographic variations in the character states of species have been observed for centuries. Indeed, some gradations have been considered so ubiquitous that they have been labelled [[Biological rules|ecological "rules"]]. One commonly cited example of a gradient in morphology is [[Gloger's rule|Gloger's Rule]], named after [[C. L. Gloger|Constantin Gloger]], who observed in 1833 that environmental factors and the pigmentation of avian [[plumage]] tend to covary with each other, such that birds found in arid areas near the Equator tend to be much darker than those in less arid areas closer to the Poles.  Since then, this rule has been extended to include many other animals, including flies, butterflies, and wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Fundamentals of Biogeography|date=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ecogeographical rules include [[Bergmann’s rule|Bergmann's Rule]], coined by [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]] in 1857, which states that [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] closer to the Equator tend to be smaller than their more northerly or southerly conspecifics.&lt;ref name="Wool" /&gt; One of the proposed reasons for this cline is that larger animals have a relatively smaller surface area to volume ratio and therefore improved heat conservancy – an important advantage in cold climates.&lt;ref name="Wool"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wool|first1=David|title=The Driving Forces of Evolution: Genetic Processes in Populations|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydWuuBw6xeYC&amp;q=huxley+1942+cline|isbn=9781578084456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the environment in imposing a selective pressure and producing this cline has been heavily implicated due to the fact that Bergmann's Rule has been observed across many independent lineages of species and continents. For example, the [[house sparrow]], which was introduced in the early 1850s to the eastern United States, evolved a north-south gradient in size soon after its introduction. This gradient reflects the gradient that already existed in the house sparrow's native range in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Geoecology: An evolutionary approach|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|url=https://archive.org/details/geoecologyevolut0000hugg|url-access=registration|isbn=9780415086899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ring species]]&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of biogeography'', Richard J. Huggett, 2nd ed. (2004), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; are a distinct type of cline where the geographical distribution in question is circular in shape, so that the two ends of the cline overlap with one another, giving two adjacent populations that rarely [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]] due to the cumulative effect of the many changes in phenotype along the cline. The populations elsewhere along the cline interbreed with their geographically adjacent populations as in a standard cline. In the case of ''[[Larus]]'' gulls, the habitats of the end populations even overlap, which introduces questions as to what constitutes a species: nowhere along the cline can a line be drawn between the populations, but they are unable to interbreed.

In humans, clines in the frequency of blood types has allowed scientists to infer past population migrations. For example, the Type B blood group reaches its highest frequency in Asia, but become less frequent further west. From this, it has been possible to infer that some Asian populations migrated towards Europe around 2,000 years ago, causing genetic admixture in an [[isolation by distance]] model. In contrast to this cline, blood Type A shows the reverse pattern, reaching its highest frequency in Europe and declining in frequency towards Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birx|first1=H.

[[File:Mussels on rock.JPG|thumb|right|alt=picture of clumped mussels borrowed from [[mussels]]|A group of clumped [[mussels]] on rocks]]

'''Clumping''' is a behavior in an [[organism]], usually [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]], in which individuals of a particular species group close to one another for beneficial purposes. Clumping can be caused by the abiotic environment surrounding an organism. [[Barnacles]], for example, group together on rocks that are exposed for the least amount of time during the low tide.&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite book|last=Karleskint|first=George|title=Introduction to Marine Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBXTCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=clumping+of+sessile+organisms|date=26 April 2012|page=22|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781133364467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, clumping in sessile animals starts when one organism binds to a hard substrate, such as rock, and other members of the same species attach themselves afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boucot|first=A.J|title=Evolutionary Paleobiology of Behavior and Coevolution|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Elsevier|page=128|isbn=9781483290812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFPgBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=clumping+of+sessile+organisms}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbivorous [[snails]] are known to clump around where sufficient algae are present.&lt;ref name =george /&gt; The clumping of [[mussels]] (shown right) has been found to be influenced by competition with other species. The mussels attach themselves by [[byssal thread]]s to potential competitors for space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khalaman|first1=Vyacheslav|last2=Lezin|first2=Peter|title=Clumping behavior and byssus production as strategies for substrate competition in Mytilus edulis|date=March 2015|journal=Invertebrate Biology|volume=134|pages=38–47|doi=10.1111/ivb.12075|access-date=9 September 2017|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271649152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
=== Predation avoidance ===
Clumping and increased locomotion has been found to occur with organisms such as blue mussels ([[Blue mussel|''Mytilus edulis'']]) due to risks from predators such as the European lobster (''[[Homarus gammarus]]''). Trade-offs exist with clumping such as decreased growth and less reproductive activity from mussels clumping together due to predation. However, there are also benefits obtained, such as decreased mortality from predation and adverse weather conditions, from clumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Côté|first=Isabelle M|last2=Jelnikar|first2=Eva|date=1999-03-15|title=Predator-induced clumping behaviour in mussels (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098198001555|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|language=en|volume=235|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.1016/S0022-0981(98)00155-5|issn=0022-0981}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clumping has been practiced by bivalve organisms from the times of the fossil record, and the trade-offs between living quite an aggregated lifestyle. Predators such as the gastropod ''[[Nucella lamellosa]]'' utilize drilling techniques in order to hunt prey such as the blue mussels, and the latter’s clumping strategies results in significantly less drilling frequency overall. However, the average drilling placement and variation by the gastropod did not show variation as a result of clumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casey|first=Michelle M.|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Devapriya|date=2008-12-15|title=Clumping behavior as a strategy against drilling predation: Implications for the fossil record|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098108004796|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|language=en|volume=367|issue=2|pages=174–179|doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2008.09.020|issn=0022-0981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Measuring clumped populations of organisms in nature can prove challenging at times for researchers. [[Quadrat]] sampling, a favored method by ecologists to study the density of populations, is not as effective with criteria such as those groups that are clumped. Other methods instead can be utilized to measure clumped populations, such as the line-intercept method which is more popular with organisms that can be studied and identified before they move. The reasoning behind organisms clumping revolve around resources being restrained in smaller regions within larger ones and select organisms forming social groups. The funnel-web spider (''[[Agelenopsis aperta]]'') at smaller scales are evenly distributed in their habitats, but are a clumped species on larger scales. The reasoning for this is two-fold. Firstly, these types of spiders prefer environments with the ability to attract insect prey and have favorable thermal properties. Secondly, there is a limited space for spiders to establish their websites, and competition for these spaces is substantial. However, on a macro scale, most organisms actually have clumped distributions due to their habitats not being eventually distributed over extensive areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Density and Dispersion {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/density-and-dispersion-19688035/|access-date=2021-12-07|website=www.nature.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar trends are seen with other species of spiders. ''[[Stegodyphus lineatus]]'' sees disadvantages no matter what other parameters exist when feeding in large groups. Otherwise, these types of spiders were able to survive in close proximity most effectively when they were of approximate equal size. The size of groups also played a role in the ability of these spiders to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=J. M.|date=1995-09-01|title=Survival and growth in groups of a subsocial spider (Stegodyphus lineatus)|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01240418|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=237–248|doi=10.1007/BF01240418|issn=1420-9098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cellular clumping ==
The practice of clumping occurs at both the macro and micro level for organisms. Closely tied to the [[Symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic theory]], there exists significant evidence that single-celled organisms in the distant past evolved and combined with other organisms to create complex multi-cellular lifeforms that make up much of life in the present. This was despite the fact that these single-celled organisms were capable of sustaining themselves and reproducing to create future generations. Nevertheless, this occurrence is considered to be a major transition in the evolution of life. The benefits of these multi-cellular lifeforms forming include further advances in efficiency to already existing ways that single-celled organisms cooperated; the creation of extracellular "public goods" is an example of organisms gaining from clumping. However, cooperation could still evolve and coexist alongside clumping as a strategy for organisms. As genetic similarity strengthened between organisms that clumped, both "public goods" production and clumping itself became more prevalent and easier to accomplish in the case of the latter. In addition, just small changes in genetic similarity can cause major shifts the outcome of evolution for organisms, such as increased output of vital materials for survival and growth. Clumping can be impeded when the number of organisms that benefits must be shared with increases, but stimulated when those organisms are more related to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biernaskie|first=Jay M.|last2=West|first2=Stuart A.|date=2015-08-22|title=Cooperation, clumping and the evolution of multicellularity|url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.1075|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=282|issue=1813|pages=20151075|doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.1075|pmc=4632621|pmid=26246549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cobalt deficiency ==
{{See also|Vitamin B12 deficiency}}
In humans, consumption of cobalt-containing vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; meets all needs for cobalt. For cattle and sheep, which meet vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; needs via synthesis by resident bacteria in the rumen, there is a function for inorganic cobalt. In the early 20th century, during the development of farming on the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau]] of New Zealand, cattle suffered from what was termed "bush sickness". It was discovered that the volcanic soils lacked the cobalt salts essential for the cattle food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soils |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/farm/content/soils.html#bush_sickness |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125213027/http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/farm/content/soils.html#bush_sickness |archive-date=2012-01-25 |access-date=2012-01-16 |publisher=Waikato University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDoewel"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDowell |first1=Lee Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UR9MnQ806LsC&amp;pg=PA525 |title=Vitamins in Animal and Human Nutrition |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-37668-3 |edition=2nd |location=Hoboken |page=525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "coast disease" of sheep in the [[Ninety Mile Desert]] of the [[Limestone Coast|Southeast]] of [[South Australia]] in the 1930s was found to originate in nutritional deficiencies of trace elements cobalt and copper.

'''Cognitive biology''' is an emerging science that regards natural [[cognition]] as a [[biological function]].&lt;ref&gt;p133 in Lyon and Keijzer (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theoretical assumption that every [[organism]]—whether a single cell or [[multicellular]]—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a [[sensory-motor coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Duijn, et al. (2006). "Principles of minimal cognition: Casting cognition as sensorimotor coordination."&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survive from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007). “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; And since by [[Darwinian theory]] the [[species]] of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Spetch and Friedman (2006), "Comparative cognition of object recognition.".&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems,&lt;ref&gt;Baluška and Mancuso (2009). Deep evolutionary origins of neurobiology: Turning the essence of ‘neural’ upside-down.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013a) and visit the Comparative Cognition Society to enjoy their publication, ''[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
While [[cognitive science]] endeavors to explain human thought and the [[conscious mind]], the work of cognitive biology is focused on the most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large&lt;ref&gt;[1]See for examples Byrne, et al. (2009), “Elephant cognition in primate perspective.”&lt;/ref&gt; and small,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Ben Jacob, et al. (2006). "Seeking the foundations of cognition in bacteria.”&lt;/ref&gt; both plant&lt;ref&gt;As one example, see Calvo and Keijzer  (2009), "Cognition in plants."&lt;/ref&gt; and animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ ''Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews'']&lt;/ref&gt; “Mounting evidence suggests that even [[bacteria]] grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007), “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; Without thinking or [[Perception|perceiving]] as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], then finds an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is due to the lack of a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a ''[[science]]'' of cognitive biology has yet to be established.&lt;ref&gt;There is no mention of cognitive biology, for example, in Frankish and Ramsey (2012), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science''. Nor is cognitive biology mentioned in Margolis, et al.(2012), ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prolegomena]]&lt;ref&gt;At the 2007 meeting of the International Society for the History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, a paper was presented with the apt title: “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.” See Lyon and Opie (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Goodwin and Ladislav Kováč, discussed below.&lt;/ref&gt; have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet, as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.

Although the two terms are sometimes used synonymously,&lt;ref&gt;See p135, 136, and 150 in Huber and Wilkinson (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive biology should not be confused with the [[Santiago Theory of Cognition|biology of cognition]] in the sense that it is used by adherents to the Chilean School of Biology of Cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inteco.cl/biology/ |title=Chilean School of Biology of Cognition - the Web Page of Humberto Maturana |access-date=2014-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101230128/http://www.inteco.cl/biology/ |archive-date=2011-11-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the Santiago School, the biology of cognition is based on the work of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana (1970), “Biology of Cognition.”&lt;/ref&gt; who crafted the doctrine of [[autopoiesis]]. Their work began in 1970 while the first mention of cognitive biology by [[Brian Goodwin]] (discussed below) was in 1977 from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977), "Cognitive biology." A copy of this four page paper is difficult to find. However, an eight page paper—Goodwin (1978), “A cognitive view of biological process,”—is easy to procure and uses his own 1977 paper as a reference. A study of the other references in the ’78 paper suggests a unique perspective without mention of Maturana or Varela.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'Cognitive biology' first appeared in the literature as a paper with that title by [[Brian Goodwin|Brian C. Goodwin]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977) "Cognitive biology."&lt;/ref&gt; There and in several related publications&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 1976a, 1976b, and 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin explained the advantage of cognitive biology in the context of his work on morphogenesis. He subsequently moved on to other issues of structure, form, and complexity with little further mention of cognitive biology. Without an advocate, Goodwin's concept of cognitive biology has yet to gain widespread acceptance. 
 
Aside from an essay regarding Goodwin's conception by [[Margaret Boden]] in 1980, the next appearance of ‘cognitive biology’ as a phrase in the literature came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, [[Ladislav Kováč]]. His conception, based on natural principles grounded in bioenergetics and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kováč's continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian.

By the 1990s, breakthroughs in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a cornucopia of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Yet aside from the theorists already mentioned, no one was addressing cognitive biology except for Kováč.
 
=== Kováč’s cognitive biology ===

Ladislav Kováč's “Introduction to cognitive biology” (Kováč, 1986a) lists ten ‘Principles of Cognitive Biology.’ A closely related thirty page paper was published the following year: “Overview: Bioenergetics between chemistry, genetics and physics.” (Kováč, 1987). Over the following decades, Kováč elaborated, updated, and expanded these themes in frequent publications, including  "Fundamental principles of cognitive biology" (Kováč, 2000), “Life, chemistry, and cognition” (Kováč, 2006a), "Information and Knowledge in Biology: Time for Reappraisal” (Kováč, 2007) and "Bioenergetics: A key to brain and mind" (Kováč, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Although many of his publications are difficult to find, this URL has them all: &lt;http://www.biocenter.sk/lkpublics.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic usage ==

=== University seminar ===
The concept of cognitive biology is exemplified by this seminar description:&lt;ref&gt;The seminar, titled "Cognitive Biology," was presented by Professor William Bechtel in the autumn of 2013 by the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. The [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/ seminar description] was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session featured the presentation of a paper titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]" The paper’s author and host of the seminar sessions was [[William Bechtel]], a philosopher of science who has written extensively on the philosophy and history of cognitive science. See for example Bechtel, W., Abrahamsen, A. and Graham, G. (1998), ‘The life of cognitive science’, in ed. W. Bechtel and G. Graham, A Companion to Cognitive Science (Malden, MA and Oxford: Blackwell Publishers Ltd.), pp. 1–104. A more recent example: Abrahamsen, A. and Bechtel, W. (2012). History and core themes. In K. Frankish and W. Ramsey, The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{Cquote|Cognitive science has focused primarily on human cognitive activities. These include perceiving, remembering and learning, evaluating and deciding, planning actions, etc. But humans are not the only organisms that engage in these activities. Indeed, virtually all organisms need to be able to procure information both about their own condition and their environment and regulate their activities in ways appropriate to this information. In some cases species have developed distinctive ways of performing cognitive tasks. But in many cases these mechanisms have been conserved and modified in other species. This course will focus on a variety of organisms not usually considered in cognitive science such as bacteria, planaria, leeches, fruit flies, bees, birds and various rodents, asking about the sorts of cognitive activities these organisms perform, the mechanisms they employ to perform them, and what lessons about cognition more generally we might acquire from studying them.&lt;ref&gt;In the preceding paragraph, neither mention nor definition of cognitive biology is made. Rather, context is established through the initial three sentences and an excellent description of cognitive biology is presented thereafter. The original seminar description was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session features a talk by Professor Bechtel titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== University workgroup ===
The [[University of Adelaide]] has established a "Cognitive Biology" workgroup using this operating concept:
{{Cquote|Cognition is, first and foremost, a natural biological [[phenomenon]] — regardless of how the engineering of artificial intelligence proceeds. As such, it makes sense to approach cognition like other biological phenomena. This means first assuming a meaningful degree of continuity among different types of organisms—an assumption borne out more and more by [[comparative biology]], especially [[genomics]]—studying simple model systems (e.g., [[microbes]], worms, flies) to understand the basics, then scaling up to more complex examples, such as mammals and [[primates]], including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018181532/http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/ |date=2014-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Members of the group study the biological literature on simple organisms (e.g., [[nematode]]) in regard to cognitive process and look for [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in more complex organisms (e.g., crow) already well studied. This comparative approach is expected to yield simple cognitive concepts common to all organisms. “It is hoped a theoretically well-grounded toolkit of basic cognitive concepts will facilitate the use and discussion of research carried out in different fields to increase understanding of two foundational issues: '''what cognition is''' and '''what cognition does''' in the biological context.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018181532/http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/ |date=2014-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bold letters from original text.)
 
The group's choice of name, as they explain on a separate webpage, might have been ‘[[embodied cognition]]’&lt;ref&gt;This option perpetuates a bias established by the original interdisciplinary grouping that formed the [[cognitive sciences]] in the 1970s: [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]]. Clarification of cognition was slow in coming, even as computers and robots became more efficient. Some argued that a cognitive agent had to be embodied to interface with the world, thus excluding stationary computers. So a new member was added to the cognitive sciences, i.e., the science of [[embodied cognition]]. Both robot frogs and biological frogs were valid subjects for experiment.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘biological cognitive science.’&lt;ref&gt;Such a name implies that this is just another cognitive science, one among equals.&lt;/ref&gt; But the group chose ‘cognitive biology’ for the sake of (i) emphasis and (ii) method. For the sake of emphasis, (i) “We want to keep the focus on biology because for too long cognition was considered a function that could be almost entirely divorced from its physical instantiation, to the extent that whatever could be said of cognition almost by definition had to be applicable to both organisms and machines.” (ii) The method is to “assume (if only for the sake of enquiry) that cognition is a biological function similar to other biological functions—such as respiration, nutrient circulation, waste elimination, and so on.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013b). “Why Cognitive Biology?” http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/why/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230036/http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/why/ |date=2014-07-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The method supposes that the genesis of cognition is biological, i.e., the method is ''[[biogenic substance|biogenic]]''. The host of the group's website has said elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;See also Lyon and Opie (2007) “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; that cognitive biology requires a biogenic approach, having identified ten principles of biogenesis in an earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;More detail can be found in Lyon (2006), “The biogenic approach to cognition.”.&lt;/ref&gt; The first four biogenic principles are quoted here to illustrate the depth at which the foundations have been set at the [[Adelaide]] school of cognitive biology:

#“Complex cognitive capacities have evolved from simpler forms of cognition. There is a continuous line of meaningful descent.”
#“Cognition directly or indirectly modulates the physico-chemical-electrical processes that constitute an organism .”
#“Cognition enables the establishment of reciprocal causal relations with an environment, leading to exchanges of matter and energy that are essential to the organism’s continued persistence, well-being or replication.”
#“Cognition relates to the (more or less) continuous assessment of system needs relative to prevailing circumstances, the potential for interaction, and whether the current interaction is working or not.”&lt;ref&gt;See Lyon (2006), pps 15-20 for the principles quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

The webpage for the Center for Cognitive Biology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.biocenter.sk/welcome1a.html | title=Center for Cognitive Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a link to "Foundations of Cognitive Biology," a page that simply contains a quotation from a paper authored by Ladislav Kováč, the site's founder. His perspective is briefly discussed below.

== Cognitive biology as a category ==

The words ‘cognitive’ and ‘biology’ are also used together as the name of a category. The category of ''cognitive biology'' has no fixed content but, rather, the content varies with the user. If the content can only be recruited from ''[[cognitive science]]'', then cognitive biology would seem limited to a selection of items in the main set of sciences included by the interdisciplinary concept—[[cognitive psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; These six separate sciences were allied “to bridge the gap between brain and mind” with an [[interdisciplinary]] approach in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating scientists were concerned only with human cognition. As it gained momentum, the growth of cognitive science in subsequent decades seemed to offer a big tent to a variety of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See first page of Von Eckardt, Barbara. What is cognitive science?. MIT press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, for example, considered evolutionary epistemology a fellow-traveler. Others appropriated the keyword, as for example Donald Griffin in 1978, when he advocated the establishment of [[cognitive ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Donald R. "Prospects for a cognitive ethology." Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1.04 (1978): 527-538.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, breakthroughs in [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cell biology|cell]], [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary]], and [[developmental biology]] generated a [[cornucopia]] of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, the decision to append ''cognitive'' to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the [[Computational biology|computational]] and [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. (1996). Cognition = life: Implications for higher-level cognition. Behavioural Processes 35: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt; approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of [[simulated]] v. [[embodied cognition|embodied]]&lt;ref&gt;Ziemke, Tom (2003). What's that thing called embodiment. In Proceedings of the 25th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 1305-1310). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.
 
One solution is to consider ''cognitive biology'' only as a subset of ''cognitive science''. For example, a major publisher's website&lt;ref&gt;[55] ''WIRES'' (Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews) (2013). Wiley Online Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/&lt;/ref&gt; displays links to material in a dozen domains of major scientific endeavor. One of which is described thus: “Cognitive science is the study of how the mind works, addressing cognitive functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, reasoning and problem solving, decision-making and consciousness.” Upon its selection from the display, the ''Cognitive Science'' page offers in nearly alphabetical order these topics: ''Cognitive Biology'', Computer Science, Economics, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience. Linked through that list of topics, upon its selection the ''Cognitive Biology'' page offers a selection of reviews and articles with biological content ranging from [[cognitive ethology]]&lt;ref&gt;For consideration of cogbio v cogetho, see p23 in Kamil (1998), “On the Proper Definition of Cognitive Ethology”.&lt;/ref&gt; through [[evolutionary epistemology]]; cognition and art; [[evo-devo]] and cognitive science; [[animal learning]]; genes and cognition; cognition and animal welfare; etc.

A different application of the ''cognitive biology'' category is manifest in the 2009 publication of papers presented at a three-day interdisciplinary workshop on “The New Cognitive Sciences” held at the [[Konrad Lorenz Institute]] for Evolution and Cognition Research in 2006. The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from “Animals as Natural Geometers” and “Color Generalization by Birds” through “Evolutionary Biology of Limited Attention” and “A comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking” as well as “Neuroethology of Attention in Primates” and ten more with less colorful titles. “[O]n the last day of the workshop the participants agreed [that] the title ‘Cognitive Biology’ sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of the cognitive and the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.”&lt;ref&gt;Tommasi, et al., page x in Preface. See pps 3-11 for a discussion of cognitive science and biology.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al. (2009), ''Cognitive Biology: Evolutionary and Developmental Perspectives on Mind, Brain and Behavior.''
 
A final example of categorical use comes from an author’s introduction to his 2011 publication on the subject, ''Cognitive Biology: Dealing with Information from Bacteria to Minds''. After discussing the differences between the cognitive and biological sciences, as well as the value of one to the other, the author concludes: “Thus, the object of this book should be considered as an attempt at building a new discipline, that of ''cognitive biology'', which endeavors to bridge these two domains.”&lt;ref&gt;Author’s italics, p2 in Auletta (2011), Cognitive biology: dealing with information from bacteria to minds.&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a detailed methodology illustrated by examples in biology anchored by concepts from [[cybernetics]] (e.g., self-regulatory systems) and [[quantum information theory]] (regarding probabilistic changes of state) with an invitation "to consider system theory together with information theory as the formal tools that may ground biology and cognition as traditional mathematics grounds physics.”&lt;ref&gt;Auletta (2011), p61. See also, for examples, pps 335 &amp; 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="12561" xml:space="preserve">'''COLD-PCR''' ('''co'''-amplification at '''l'''ower '''d'''enaturation temperature '''PCR''') is a modified [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) protocol that enriches variant [[alleles]] from a mixture of wildtype and [[mutation]]-containing [[DNA]]. The ability to preferentially amplify and identify minority alleles and low-level [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] DNA mutations in the presence of excess wildtype alleles is useful for the detection of mutations. Detection of mutations is important in the case of early [[cancer]] detection from [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[biopsies]] and body fluids such as [[blood plasma]] or [[Serum (blood)|serum]], assessment of residual [[disease]] after [[surgery]] or [[chemotherapy]], disease staging and molecular profiling for prognosis or tailoring therapy to individual patients, and monitoring of therapy outcome and cancer remission or relapse. Common PCR will amplify both the major (wildtype) and minor (mutant) alleles with the same efficiency, occluding the ability to easily detect the presence of low-level mutations. The capacity to detect a mutation in a mixture of variant/wildtype DNA is valuable because this mixture of variant DNAs can occur when provided with a heterogeneous sample – as is often the case with cancer biopsies. Currently, traditional PCR is used in tandem with a number of different downstream assays for [[genotyping]] or the detection of [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] mutations. These can include the use of amplified DNA for [[RFLP]] analysis, [[MALDI-TOF]] (matrix-assisted laser-desorption–time-of-flight) genotyping, or direct sequencing for detection of mutations by [[Sanger sequencing]] or [[pyrosequencing]]. Replacing traditional PCR with COLD-PCR for these downstream assays will increase the reliability in detecting mutations from mixed samples, including [[tumors]] and body fluids.

==COLD-PCR method overview==
[[File:COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of COLD-PCR compared to regular PCR.|Conventional PCR compared to COLD-PCR.]]
The underlying principle of COLD-PCR is that single [[nucleotide]] mismatches will slightly alter the melting temperature (Tm) of the double-stranded DNA. Depending on the sequence context and position of the mismatch, Tm changes of 0.2–1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (0.36–2.7&amp;nbsp;°F) are common for sequences up to 200bp or higher. Knowing this the authors of the protocol took advantage of two observations:
* Each double-stranded DNA has a 'critical temperature' (Tc) lower than its Tm. The PCR amplification efficiency drops measurably below the Tc.
* The Tc is dependent on DNA sequence. Two template DNA fragments differing by only one or two nucleotide mismatches will have different amplification efficiencies if the denaturation step of PCR is set to the Tc.

Keeping these principles in mind the authors developed the following general protocol:
# Denaturation stage. DNA is denatured at a high temperature{{spaced ndash}}usually {{Convert|94|C|F}}.
# Intermediate annealing stage. Set an intermediate annealing temperature that allows hybridization of mutant and wildtype allele DNA to one another. Because the mutant allele DNA forms the minority of DNA in the mixture they will be more likely to form mismatch heteroduplex DNA with the wildtype DNA.
# Melting stage. These heteroduplexes will more readily melt at lower temperatures. Hence they are selectively denatured at the Tc.
# Primer annealing stage. The homo-duplex DNA will preferentially remain double stranded and not be available for primer annealing.
# Extension stage. The DNA polymerase will extend complementary to the template DNA. Since the heteroduplex DNA is used as template, a larger proportion of minor variant DNA will be amplified and be available for subsequent rounds of PCR.

There are two forms of COLD-PCR that have been developed to date. Full COLD-PCR and fast COLD-PCR.
[[File:Fast versus Full COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of full COLD-PCR in comparison to fast COLD-PCR.|Full COLD-PCR versus Fast COLD-PCR.]]

===Full COLD-PCR===
Full COLD-PCR is identical to the protocol outlined above. These five stages are used for each round of amplification.

===Fast COLD-PCR===
Fast COLD-PCR differs from Full COLD-PCR in that the denaturation and intermediate annealing stages are skipped. This is because, in some cases, the preferential amplification of the mutant DNA is so great that ensuring the formation of the mutant/wildtype heteroduplex DNA is not needed. Thus the denaturation can occur at the Tc, proceed to primer annealing, and then polymerase-mediated extension. Each round of amplification will include these three stages in that order. By utilizing the lower denaturation temperature, the reaction will discriminate towards the products with the lower Tm – i.e. the variant alleles. Fast COLD-PCR produces much faster results due to the shortened protocol. However, it is important to note that Full COLD-PCR is essential for amplification of all possible mutations in the starting mixture of DNA.

Two-round COLD-PCR is a modified version of Fast COLD-PCR. During the second round of Fast COLD-PCR nested primers are used. This improves the sensitivity of mutation detection compared to one-round Fast COLD-PCR.&lt;ref name=nested&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Milbury CA, Li C, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Two-round COLD-PCR-based Sanger sequencing identifies a novel spectrum of low-level mutations in lung adenocarcinoma |journal=Human Mutation |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1583–90 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19760750 |pmc=2784016 |doi=10.1002/humu.21112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of COLD-PCR to date==
COLD-PCR has been used to improve the reliability of a number of different assays that traditionally use conventional PCR.
[[File:COLD-PCR applications.jpg|thumb|alt=Some of the downstream applications for COLD-PCR.|Downstream applications using conventional PCR that can be replaced by COLD-PCR.]]

===RFLP and COLD-PCR===
A restriction fragment length polymorphism results in the cleavage (or absence thereof) of DNA for a specific mutation by a selected restriction enzyme that will not cleave the wildtype DNA. In a study using a mixture of wildtype and mutation containing DNA amplified by regular PCR or COLD-PCR, COLD-PCR preceding RFLP analysis was shown to improve the mutation detection by 10-20 fold.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Wang L, Mamon H, [[Matthew Kulke|Kulke MH]], Berbeco R, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Replacing PCR with COLD-PCR enriches variant DNA sequences and redefines the sensitivity of genetic testing |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=579–84 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18408729 |doi=10.1038/nm1708|s2cid=205385306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanger sequencing and COLD-PCR===
Sanger sequencing recently was used to evaluate the enrichment of mutant DNA from a mixture of 1:20 mutant:wildtype DNA. The variant DNA containing a mutation was obtained from a [[breast cancer]] cell line known to contain [[p53]] mutations.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt; Comparison of Sanger sequencing chromatograms indicated that the mutant allele was enriched 13 fold when COLD-PCR was used compared to traditional PCR alone.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt; This was determined by the size of the peaks on the chromatogram at the variant allele location.

As well, COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 mutations from lung-[[adenocarcinoma]] samples. The study was able to detect 8 low level (under 20% abundance) mutations that would likely have been missed using conventional methods that don't enrich for variant sequence DNA.

===Pyrosequencing and COLD-PCR===
Similar to its use in direct Sanger sequencing, with pyrosequencing COLD-PCR was shown to be capable of detecting mutations that had a prevalence 0.5–1% from the samples used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zuo Z, Chen SS, Chandra PK |title=Application of COLD-PCR for improved detection of KRAS mutations in clinical samples |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1023–31 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19430420 |doi=10.1038/modpathol.2009.59|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 and KRAS mutations by pyrosequencing, and was shown to outperform conventional PCR in both cases.

===MALDI-TOF and COLD-PCR===
The same research group that developed COLD-PCR and used it to compare the sensitivity of regular PCR for genotyping with direct Sanger sequencing, RFLP, and pyrosequencing, also ran a similar study using MALDI-TOF as a downstream application for detecting mutations. Their results indicated that COLD-PCR could enrich mutation sequences from a mixture of DNA by 10–100 fold and that mutations with an initial prevalence of 0.1–0.5% would be detectable.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=COLD-PCR: a new platform for highly improved mutation detection in cancer and genetic testing |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=427–32 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19290875 |doi=10.1042/BST0370427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 5–10% low-level detection rate expected with traditional PCR.

===QPCR and COLD-PCR===
COLD-PCR run on a [[quantitative PCR]] machine, using [[TaqMan]] probes specific for a mutation, was shown to increase the measured difference between mutant and wildtype samples.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;

==Advantages of COLD-PCR==
* Single-step method capable of enriching both known and unknown minority alleles irrespective of mutation type and position.
* Does not require any extra reagents or specialized machinery. Therefore, the cost is not increased.
* Better than conventional PCR for the detection of mutations in a mixed sample.
* Does not significantly increase experiment run time compared to conventional PCR.

==Disadvantages of COLD-PCR==
* Optimal Tc must be measured and determined for each amplicon. Adding an extra step to conventional PCR-based procedures.
* Requirement for precise denaturation temperature control during PCR to within ± 0.3&amp;nbsp;°C (0.54&amp;nbsp;°F).
* A suitable critical temperature may not be available that differentiates between mutant and wildtype DNA sequences.
* Restricted to analyzing sequences smaller than approximately 200bp.
* Vulnerable to polymerase-introduced errors.
* Variable overall mutation enrichment which depends on DNA position and nucleotide substitution.
* No guarantee that all low-level mutations will be preferentially enriched.

==History==
COLD-PCR was originally described by Li ''et al.'' in a Nature Medicine paper published in 2008 from Mike Makrigiorgos's lab group at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute of Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name=original /&gt; As summarized above, the technology has been used in a number of proof-of-principle experiments and medical research diagnostic experiments.

Recently, the COLD-PCR technology has been licensed by Transgenomic, Inc. The licensing terms include the exclusive rights to commercialize the technology combined with Sanger sequencing. The plans are to develop commercial applications that will allow for rapid high-sensitivity detection of low-level somatic and mitochondrial DNA mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laboratorytalk editorial team|date=Oct 2009|title=Transgenomics licenses COLD-PCR technology|url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html|access-date=2010-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718232900/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html#|archive-date=2011-07-18|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Other technologies are available for the detection of minority DNA mutations, and these methods can be segregated into their ability to enrich for and detect either known or unknown mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milbury CA, Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=PCR-Based Methods for the Enrichment of Minority Alleles and Mutations |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=632–40 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19201784 |pmc=2811432 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.113035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ColegioBiologosPeru.jpg|right]]
'''Colegio de Biólogos del Perú''' or '''College of Biologists of Peru''' is a professional association in [[Peru]]. This college accepts only graduates in [[biology]] that have opted to be licensed through a special inter-university procedure called ''Licenciatura''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2006-11-07|title=Colegio de Biologos del Perú|url=http://www.cbperu.org/|access-date=2020-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107082031/http://www.cbperu.org/|archive-date=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[1972]] and its creation was sanctioned by Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=College of Biologists of Peru|url=http://cbperu.org/pdf/LC.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190922/http://cbperu.org/pdf/LC.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-03|access-date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Peruvian law, in order to work as a professional [[biologist]] one must be registered and be a dues-paying active member of the Colegio de Biólogos del Perú. It is governed by a National Dean or President, who is elected every two years by general elections, presided over a National Council. The National Council is constituted by 18 Regional Councils. As of 2007 it had over 7,000 registered members nationwide; who must be active dues-paying members to exercise their right to vote. Regional Councils are headed by regional deans elected ( by popular vote in their respective circumscriptions) by biologists registered in those regions.

In 2006, Peruvian Congress passed Law 28847&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=CBP|url=http://www.cbperu.org/pdf/leybio.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031222357/http://www.cbperu.org/pdf/leybio.pdf|archive-date=2006-10-31|access-date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that regulates the work of biologists and requires them to be duly registered in the Colegio de Biólogos del Perú in order to work for government, academia or the private world.

Past National Deans are Isabel Martos, Soledad Osorio, Sandro Chavez, Magdalena Pavlich, and Damisela Coz. The present National Dean is [[Ernesto Bustamante]] elected in April 2007 to serve the term 2007 - 2009.

A '''colony picker''' is an instrument used to automatically identify [[Colony (biology)|microbial colonies]] growing on a [[Agar|solid]] [[Growth medium|media]], pick them and duplicate them either onto solid or liquid media. It is used in research laboratories as well as in industrial environments such as [[Food safety|food testing]] and in [[microbiological culture]]s.

== Uses ==
In food safety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/MLG_41_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207095754/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/MLG_41_01.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in clinical diagnosis colony picking is used to isolate individual colonies for identification. Colony pickers automate this procedure, saving costs and personnel and reducing [[human error]]. In the [[drug discovery]] process they are used for [[High throughput screening|screening]] purposes by picking thousands of microbial colonies and transferring them for further testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=USA |title=Automated panning and screening procedure on microplates for antibody generation from phage display libraries. |date=2015-09-28 |pmid=19224869 |doi=10.1177/1087057108330113 |volume=14 |journal=J Biomol Screen |issue=3 |pages=282–93|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other uses include [[cloning]] procedures and [[DNA sequencing]].

== as add-on ==
Colony pickers are sold either as stand-alone instruments or as add-ons to liquid handling robots, using the robot as the [[actuator]] and adding a camera and [[image analysis]] capabilities. This strategy lowers the price of the system considerably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/gene-cloning-and-colony-picking/3904/ |title=Gene Cloning and Colony Picking &amp;#124; GEN Magazine Articles &amp;#124; GEN |publisher=Genengnews.com |date= November 2011|accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adds reusability as the robot can still be used for other purposes.

The integrated process includes sign up, the self-collection kit, and results returned via text and email to patients, clinicians, and public health authorities. Color returns results, on average, within 24–48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-08-06|title=This company has a better version of a simpler, faster Covid-19 test|url=https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/06/better-simpler-faster-covid-19-test/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=STAT|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August of 2020, Color was running some of the highest-capacity test sites in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-08-31|title=Testing Demand Remains High In Bay Area|url=https://www.radio.com/kcbsradio/articles/testing-demand-remains-high-in-bay-area|access-date=2021-01-12|website=www.radio.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color was also responsible for the majority of [[San Francisco]]’s COVID-19 testing with an average turnaround time within 24 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-08-08|title=Why the time to get back COVID-19 test results in Bay Area ranges from 2 weeks to 2 days|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/A-lost-opportunity-Some-Bay-Area-test-15468141.php|access-date=2021-01-12|website=SFChronicle.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most results returned in under 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-07-07|title=Bay Area Covid-19 testing shows most have mild or no symptoms, younger people made up majority of cases|url=https://www.ktvu.com/news/bay-area-covid-19-testing-shows-most-have-mild-or-no-symptoms-younger-people-made-up-majority-of-cases|access-date=2021-01-12|website=KTVU FOX 2|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color worked with San Francisco’s CityTestSF program,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Carbon Health and Color founders see power in bringing healthcare to the edge|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/carbon-health-and-color-founders-see-power-in-bringing-healthcare-to-the-edge/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] Health Services&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-06-02|title=Alameda County's new, free COVID-19 testing site seeks to 'increase access to testing in West Oakland'|url=https://www.ktvu.com/news/alameda-countys-new-free-covid-19-testing-site-seeks-to-increase-access-to-testing-in-west-oakland|access-date=2021-01-12|website=KTVU FOX 2|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and federally qualified health centers in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-07-21|title=Marin County considers $1.6M contract for virus testing|url=https://www.marinij.com/2020/07/20/marin-county-considers-1-6m-contract-for-virus-testing/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=Marin Independent Journal|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also partnered with a wide variety of universities, employers and public health entities, including [[University of Southern California|USC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-07-30|title=USC Student Health To Expand Daily Coronavirus Testing With Minimum 500 Daily Tests|url=https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/07/30/usc-student-health-coronavirus-testing/|access-date=2021-01-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=September 24, 2020|title=United Airlines to be first U.S. airline with COVID-19 testing program for passengers|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-airlines-covid-testing-program/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January of 2022, Color had computer difficulties that resulted in delayed test results and closed testing stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abc7news.com/covid-testing-color-labs-outage/11451478/|title = System outage sends patients home after thousands waited, some for 5 hours, to get tested for COVID|date = 11 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing System ==

=== Genetics ===
Color’s physician-ordered test can be initiated by individuals online, and a sample collection kit is sent in the mail. Individuals provide a [[Saliva testing|saliva sample]] and return the kit in a pre-paid package. Color's [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments|CLIA]]-certified and [[College of American Pathologists|CAP]]-approved lab analyzes for [[Mutation|variants]] in the breast cancer genes ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', as well as 28 other genes associated with breast, prostate, colon, uterine, stomach, melanoma, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.color.com/learn/color-genes|title=Learn about the genes Color analyzes.|website=Color}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test also identifies [[Mutation|variants]] in 30 genes related to hereditary heart conditions as well as genes that may impact medication response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.color.com/learn/color-genes|title=Learn about the genes Color analyzes.|website=Color}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic counseling with board-certified genetic counselors is available for free to all individuals who use Color.

=== COVID-19 ===
Color’s [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] [[Emergency use authorization|Emergency Use Authorization]] (EUA) COVID-19 test can be accessed as a part of testing programs initiated by a public health entity, university, employer or other organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Color receives FDA authorization for COVID-19 test tech that speeds up results|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/color-receives-fda-authorization-for-covid-19-test-tech-that-speeds-up-results/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is a dry anterior nasal swab, approved for use either in an on-site or at-home setting without the need for a healthcare provider to monitor sample collection, which eases the burden on the healthcare system and reduces testing costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FDA Gives EUA for At-Home COVID-19 Testing|url=https://www.contagionlive.com/view/fda-gives-eua-for-athome-covid19-testing|access-date=2021-01-12|website=Contagion Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has received an FDA EUA for the testing assay, which is a [[nucleic acid amplification]] method called LAMP, or [[loop-mediated isothermal amplification]]. This enables processing test results 50% faster than RT-PCR,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Color receives FDA authorization for COVID-19 test tech that speeds up results|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/color-receives-fda-authorization-for-covid-19-test-tech-that-speeds-up-results/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amplification method used at most other labs. LAMP relies on a different set of chemical reagents than standard PCR tests, which helps the process avoids supply chain scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) SUMMARY FOR THE COLOR SARS-COV-2 RT-LAMP DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY|url=https://www.fda.gov/media/138249/download|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200531085609/https://www.fda.gov/media/138249/download |archive-date=2020-05-31 |access-date=|website=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In 2018, Color was selected, alongside the [[Broad Institute]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine (LMM) at [[Partners HealthCare]], to establish one of three genome centers around the country for the [[National Institutes of Health]]’s historic ''[[All of Us (initiative)|All of Us]]'' Research Program.{{cn|date=March 2022}} ''[[All of Us (initiative)|All of Us]]'' will sequence one million or more people across the US, with the goal of accelerating health research and enabling individualized prevention, treatment, and care. The program has a focus on recruitment from populations that have been historically underrepresented in clinical science and genomic medicine, in order to build a diverse biomedical data resource that provides a foundation for better insights into the biological, environmental, and behavioral factors that influence health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://allofus.nih.gov/about/all-us-research-program-overview|title=All of Us Research Program Overview|website=allofus.NIH.gov|date=22 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Color was named the sole awardee to deliver all of the genetic counseling for ''All of Us''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-funds-genetic-counseling-resource-ahead-million-person-sequencing-effort|title=NIH funds genetic counseling resource ahead of million-person sequencing effort|date=August 21, 2019|work=National Institutes of Health News Releases}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the awardee, Color will customize software and tools to integrate data from all the genome centers, standardize reporting across the program, and ensure all results are returned in a unified way. This is a first year $4.6 million grant as part of a multi-year $25 million project.

In collaboration with the [[Women's Health Initiative|Women’s Health Initiative]] and Dr. [[Mary-Claire King]] at the [[University of Washington]], Color provided genetic sequencing for the cohort of 10,000 Fabulous Ladies Over Seventy (FLOSSIES). This is the largest publicly available dataset of genetic variants associated with hereditary cancer in healthy, older individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whi.color.com/|title=FLOSSIES: A database of germline genomic variation in healthy older women|website=whi.color.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color Data, a database containing aggregated genetic and clinical information from 50,000 individuals who took a Color test,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.color.com/|title=Explore Color Data to accelerate research|website=Color}}&lt;/ref&gt; helps researchers and scientists identify genotype-phenotype correlations and novel variants for functional analysis, as well as enables data-driven drug discovery and development.

'''Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE)''' is a small [[ultraviolet|UV]] [[space telescope]] to study selected [[exoplanet]]s.&lt;ref name=UT-2021&gt;[https://www.universetoday.com/152713/a-tiny-inexpensive-satellite-will-be-studying-the-atmospheres-of-hot-jupiters/ ''A Tiny, Inexpensive Satellite Will be Studying the Atmospheres of hot Jupiters'' 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was launched as a rideshare on the [[Atlas V]] that launched [[Landsat 9]] on Sept 27 2021.&lt;ref name=UT-2021/&gt; It should operate for at least 7 months and study 10 exoplanets.

CUTE can measure near-UV (255-330&amp;nbsp;nm) and do low resolution spectroscopy of atmospheric tracers (eg. Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, OH).&lt;ref name=CUTE-home&gt;[https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/cute/ ''Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE)'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UV sensor is a 2048 x 515 pixel CCD array, with the spectrum lengthwise across the sensor.&lt;ref name=Fleming-2018&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02673v1 ''The Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE): A dedicated cubesat mission to study exoplanetary mass loss and magnetic fields'' Fleming et al. 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; The 515 pixel width provides tolerance from sensor damage.

Colostrum has an especially high amount of [[bioactive compound]]s compared to mature milk to give the newborn the best possible start to life. Specifically, colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease and infection, and immune and growth factors and other bioactives that help to activate a newborn's immune system, jumpstart gut function, and seed a healthy gut microbiome in the first few days of life. The bioactives found in colostrum are essential for a newborn's health, growth and vitality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

At birth, the surroundings of the newborn mammal change from the relatively sterile environment in the mother's uterus, with a constant nutrient supply via the placenta, to the microbe-rich environment outside, with irregular oral intake of complex milk nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sangild |first1=P.

Colostrum also has a mild [[laxative]] effect, encouraging the passing of the baby's first [[Human feces|stool]], which is called [[meconium]].  This clears excess [[bilirubin]], a waste-product of dead red blood cells which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant's body and which also helps prevent [[jaundice]].

== Bioactive components in colostrum ==
Newborns have very immature and small  [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive system]]s, and colostrum delivers its bioactives in a very concentrated low-volume form.  Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as [[lymphocytes]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/addressing-myths/myths-in-the-african-american-community.html | title=It's Only Natural| date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertotto |first1=A. |last2=Castellucci |first2=G. |last3=Fabietti |first3=G. |last4=Scalise |first4=F. |last5=Vaccaro |first5=R. |title=Lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor gamma delta in human breast milk. |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=1 November 1990 |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=1274–1275 |doi=10.1136/adc.65.11.1274-a |pmid=2147370 |pmc=1792611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[antibodies]] such as [[IgA]],  [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]], and [[IgM]].

== Human consumption of bovine colostrum ==
While it has long been understood that the colostrum a mother produces is vital to a newborn's health in the first few days of life, research has shown that bovine (cow) colostrum and its components can continue to support important biological activities when given to more mature children and adults, so that the benefits of colostrum can extend well beyond the neonatal period of development.

Bovine colostrum and human colostrum are highly similar in their makeup, both containing many of the same antibodies, immune and growth factors, and other nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGrath |first1=Brian A. |last2=Fox |first2=Patrick F. |last3=McSweeney |first3=Paul L.

The benefit of bovine colostrum for human health has been studied in many areas including:

* Immune health: Colostrum is composed of a powerful combination of bioactives that support immune health, including immunoglobulins, immune modulators, and oligosaccharides.

==Colostrum use in animal husbandry==
Colostrum is crucial for newborn farm animals.  They receive no passive transfer of immunity via the placenta before birth, so any antibodies that they need have to be ingested (unless supplied by injection or other artificial means). The ingested antibodies are absorbed from the intestine of the neonate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balfour |first1=W. E. |last2=Comline |first2=R.

The role of colostrum for newborn animals is to provide nutrition, and essential protection against infection while the immune and digestive systems are developing and maturing. Bovine colostrum provides macro- and micro-nutrients, as well as growth factors, cytokines, nucleosides, oligosaccharides, natural antimicrobials, antioxidants; and a range of immunoglobulins such as IgG, IgA, IgD, IgM and IgE. It is well established that minimal levels of IgG are essential to prevent failure of passive transfer. The iron-binding glycoproteins lactoferrin and transferrin in bovine colostrum assist in attacking pathogens by impacting their cell membrane and making them more susceptible to the immune systems attack by neutrophils. Cytokines present in bovine colostrum enhance B and T cell maturation and increase endogenous antibody production. They also play a major role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and development, proliferation, and restitution. Transfer factors enhance the activity of T cells. Other growth and immune factors such as IGF-1, IGF-2, FGF, EGF, TGF, PDGF, etc.

Bovine colostrum's components benefit the immune and digestive health of animals of all ages and species. Bovine colostrum's vast array of bioactive components collectively increase resistance to infection and disease caused by a wide range of pathogens including bacteria and viruses. The quality of the colostrum is essential in providing the essential benefits. Both contaminated early bovine colostrum at the farm level or late transition milk or milk are poor sources of the important colostral components necessary to maintain life and achieve and maintain healthy animal maturation and homoeostasis. Bovine colostrum also is beneficial in repairing or healing intestinal damage as well as increasing the absorption of nutrients from the GI tract. These properties and benefits are consistent among human and animal species.

The transition from fetal to neonatal and shift from maternal to environmental reliance requires an abrupt immunological change. In calves, for example, colostrum provides a significant benefit in neonatal intestine development. This includes villus area, circumference, height and height/crypt ratio. Colostrum is critically important to calves and foals in order to prevent failure of passive transfer and death. Calves, foals and piglets with low IgG levels have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Bovine colostrum can be used to reduce the duration and severity of infections so it can be a useful tool to include in the reduction of antibiotic use. Finally, another important and valuable benefit of colostrum is in the reduction in scours and increase in average daily weight gain all of which have a significant farmer and ultimately consumer benefit.

== Colostrum use in companion animals ==
Much like in humans and production animals, companion animal survival in the newborn stage of life is largely dependent upon colostrum. Companion animal immune systems require several weeks to several months in order to fully develop. Maternal antibodies provide benefit for a relatively short period of time so a gap exists with immune sufficiency where an animal is at risk of infection. Like humans, companion animal immune response changes with age where early life and later in life have similarities. That is, an immune bias whereby the animal has less of an ability to fend off infections and greater prevalence of allergy at both ends of the age spectrum. Stress also affects a companion animal's immune system including changes in environment, diet, etc. Maintaining gut microbial balance is key to maintaining a healthy immune system as well as mucosal integrity, similar to humans. Bovine colostrum has been demonstrated to benefit companion animal immunity and digestive health.

Bovine colostrum plays a role in increasing Ig levels, increasing lymphocyte proliferation stimulating activity and increasing phagocytosis activity. These are supported by other components of colostrum which further enhance the activity of the immune response. The iron binding glycoproteins lactoferrin and transferrin in bovine colostrum assist in attacking pathogens by impacting their cell membrane and making them more susceptible to the immune systems attack by neutrophils. Cytokines present in bovine colostrum enhance B and T cell maturation and increase endogenous antibody production. They also play a major role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and development, proliferation, restitution. Transfer factors enhance the activity of T cells. Other growth and immune factors such as IGF-1, IGF-2, FGF, EGF, TGF, PDGF, etc. Colostrum contains glycomacropeptides which help to regulate appetite.

Bovine colostrum has been shown to enhance immune response in animal models including canine, feline and equine animals including maintaining a higher level of vaccine antibody response over time and for a longer period than the vaccine alone. Animals fed colostrum had a significantly higher local immune status resulting in higher IgA through GALT stimulation. Colostrum also plays a key role in reduction or prevention of diarrhea and reduction in respiratory illness.

Dairy cattle are naturally exposed to pathogens and produce immunoglobulins against them. These antibodies are present in the cow's bloodstream and in the colostrum. These immunoglobulins are specific to many human [[pathogens]], including ''[[Escherichia coli]], [[Cryptosporidium parvum]], [[Shigella flexneri]], [[Salmonella]] ''species'', [[Staphylococcus]]'' species,&lt;ref name="McConnell2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McConnell |first1=Michelle A. |last2=Buchan |first2=Glenn |last3=Borissenko |first3=Michail V. |last4=Brooks |first4=Heather J.

Before the development of antibiotics, colostrum was the main source of immunoglobulins used to fight bacteria. In fact, when [[Albert Sabin]] made his first oral vaccine against polio, the immunoglobulin he used came from bovine colostrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sabin |first1=A.

The gut plays several important roles including acting as the main pathway for fluid, electrolyte and nutrient absorption while also acting as a barrier to toxic agents present in the gut lumen including acid, digestive enzymes and gut bacteria. It is also a major immunological defence mechanism, detecting natural commensals and triggering immune response when toxic microbes are present. Failure of homeostasis due to trauma, drugs and infectious microbes not only damages the gut but can lead to influx of damaging agents into the bloodstream. These mechanisms have relevance for multiple conditions affecting all areas of the world and socioeconomic groups such as ulcers, inflammation, and infectious diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baumgart |first1=Daniel C. |last2=Dignass |first2=Axel U. |title=Intestinal barrier function |journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care |date=November 2002 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=685–694 |doi=10.1097/00075197-200211000-00012 |pmid=12394645 |s2cid=2326543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently much interest in the potential value of colostrum for the prevention and treatment of these conditions as it is derived from natural sources and can influence damaging factors through multiple pathways including nutritional support, immunological intervention (through its immunoglobulin and other anti-microbial factors) and growth/healing factor constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Playford |first1=Raymond J. |last2=Macdonald |first2=Christopher E. |last3=Johnson |first3=Wendy S. |title=Colostrum and milk-derived peptide growth factors for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |date=1 July 2000 |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/72.1.5 |pmid=10871554 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by Kelly, inconsistency between results in some published studies may be due in part to variation in dose given and to the timing of the colostrum collection being tested (first milking versus pooled colostrum collected up to day 5 following calving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelly |first1=G.

===Hyperimmune colostrum===
Hyperimmune colostrum is natural bovine colostrum collected from a population of cows immunized repeatedly with a specific pathogen. The colostrum is collected within 24 hours of the cow giving birth. Antibodies towards the specific pathogens or antigens that were used in the immunization are present in higher levels than in the population before treatment.  Although some papers have been published  stating that specific human pathogens were just as high as in hyperimmune colostrum, and natural colostrum nearly always had higher antibody titers than did the hyperimmune version.&lt;ref name="McConnell2001"/&gt; Clinical trials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Otto |first1=Wlodzimierz |last2=Najnigier |first2=Boguslaw |last3=Stelmasiak |first3=Teodor |last4=Robins-Browne |first4=Roy M. |title=Randomized control trials using a tablet formulation of hyperimmune bovine colostrum to prevent diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in volunteers |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology |date=July 2011 |volume=46 |issue=7–8 |pages=862–868 |doi=10.3109/00365521.2011.574726 |pmid=21526980 |pmc=3154584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that if the immunization is by surface antigens of the bacteria, the Bovine Colostrum Powder &lt;ref&gt;TGA guidance BCP&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to make tablets capable of binding to the bacteria so that they are excreted in stools. This prevents the successful colonization of the gut, which would otherwise lead to bacteria releasing enterotoxigenic materials.

In [[biotechnology]], '''combinatorial biology''' is the creation of a large number of compounds (usually proteins or peptides) through technologies such as [[phage display]]. Similar to [[combinatorial chemistry]], compounds are produced by [[biosynthesis]] rather than [[organic chemistry]]. This process was developed independently by [[Richard A. Houghten]] and H. Mario Geysen in the 1980s.  Combinatorial biology allows the generation and selection of the large number of ligands for [[high-throughput screening]].&lt;ref&gt;

Combinatorial biology techniques generally begin with large numbers of peptides, which are generated and screened by physically linking a gene encoding a protein and a copy of said protein. This could involve the protein being fused to the [[M13 bacteriophage|M13]] minor coat protein pIII, with the gene encoding this protein being held within the phage particle. Large libraries of phages with different proteins on their surfaces can then be screened through automated selection and amplification for a protein that binds tightly to a particular target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pelletier J, Sidhu S |title=Mapping protein-protein interactions with combinatorial biology methods |journal=Curr.

The mission concept was submitted in May 2017 by a team from NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in response to the [[New Frontiers program]] call for mission 4, but did not pass the initial down selection. As a comet sample return mission was not ultimately selected for mission 4 ([[Dragonfly (spacecraft)|Dragonfly]], a Titan probe was selected), the CORSAIR team may re-submit the concept to a future New Frontiers program call.&lt;ref name="mext20160929"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/home/kougaku/03_report/29_senryaku/01_yano_senryaku29.pdf |title=海外ミッションを利用した太陽系サンプルリターン探査 |format=PDF |publisher=Advisory Committee for Space Engineering |access-date=2019-10-13 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The CORSAIR goal is understanding the role of comets as [[Abiogenesis|ingredients for planets and life]].&lt;Ref name='MS 2017'&gt; [https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2017/pdf/6125.pdf CORSAIR (COmet Rendezvous, Sample Acquisition, Investigation, and Return): A New Frontiers Mission Concept to Collect Samples from a Comet and Return them to Earth for Study] (PDF).

No. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; If selected for development, CORSAIR would rendezvous with comet [[88P/Howell]] for approximately 140 days to perform detailed physical and chemical characterization and return to Earth with comet samples of the [[Comet nucleus|nucleus]] and its [[Coma (cometary)|coma]].&lt;Ref name='MS 2017'/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017 Proposals"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2017/08/proposed-new-frontiers-missions.html |title=Proposed New Frontiers Missions |work=Future Planetary Exploration |date=4 August 2017 |accessdate=2017-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920093515/http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2017/08/proposed-new-frontiers-missions.html |archive-date=20 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If selected for development, the mission would have launched on 2024, cruise to the comet would take 7 years, including two Earth [[gravity assist]]s. Rendezvous with the 88P/Howell would happen in May 2031 and the interactions would last up to 294
days. The return trip to Earth would take about 4.3 years.&lt;Ref name='MS 2017'/&gt;

[[File:Spearfish remora.jpg|thumb|[[Remora]] are specially adapted to attach themselves to larger fish that provide locomotion and food.]]

'''Commensalism''' is a long-term [[biological interaction]] ([[symbiosis]]) in which members of one [[species]] gain benefits while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed.&lt;ref name=wilson1975/&gt; This is in contrast with [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], in which both organisms benefit from each other; [[Symbiosis#Amensalism|amensalism]], where one is harmed while the other is unaffected; [[parasitism]], where one is harmed and the other benefits, and [[parasitoidism]], which is similar to parasitism but the [[parasitoid]] has a free-living state and instead of just harming its host, it eventually ends up killing it.

The commensal (the species that benefits from the association) may obtain nutrients, shelter, support, or locomotion from the host species, which is substantially unaffected. The commensal relation is often between a larger host and a smaller commensal; the [[Host (biology)|host]] organism is unmodified, whereas the commensal species may show great structural adaptation consistent with its habits, as in the [[remora]]s that ride attached to [[sharks]] and other fishes. Remoras feed on their hosts' fecal matter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=E. H.|last2=Mignucci-Giannoni|first2=A. A.|last3=Bunkley-Williams|first3=L.|last4=Bonde|first4=R.

G.|date=2003|title=Echeneid-sirenian associations, with information on sharksucker diet|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=1176–1183|doi=10.1046/j.1095-8649.2003.00236.x|issn=0022-1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[pilot fish]] feed on the leftovers of their hosts' meals. Numerous birds perch on bodies of large mammal herbivores or feed on the insects turned up by grazing mammals.&lt;ref name=pmid29576981/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "commensalism" is derived from the word "commensal", meaning "eating at the same table" in human social interaction, which in turn comes through [[French language|French]] from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''commensalis'', meaning "sharing a table", from the prefix ''[[wikt:com-#Latin|com-]]'', meaning "together", and ''[[wikt:mensa#Latin|mensa]]'', meaning "table" or "meal".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|commensalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commensality, at the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], refers to professors eating at the same table as students (as they live in the same "college").

[[Pierre-Joseph van Beneden]] introduced the term "commensalism" in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;van Beneden, Pierre-Joseph (1876). Animal parasites and messmates. London, Henry S. King. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/132633#/summary link].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of commensal relationships ==
The commensal pathway was traveled by animals that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received little benefit or harm. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the 'tamer' individuals: less aggressive, with shorter [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] distances. Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans and led to a domestic relationship.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

The leap from a [[synanthrope|synanthropic]] population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, at which point the establishment of a reciprocal relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and then human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a [[coevolution]]ary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel [[Ecological niche|niche]] that includes another species with evolving behaviors.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

===Dogs===
The dog was the first domesticated animal, and was domesticated and widely established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Pleistocene]], well before the cultivation of crops or the domestication of other animals.&lt;ref name=larson2012/&gt; The dog is often hypothesised to be a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. Archaeological evidence, such as the Bonn-Oberkassel dog dating to ~14,000BP,&lt;ref name=janssens2018/&gt; supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture &lt;ref name=vila1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt; and began close to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] when hunter-gatherers preyed on [[megafauna]].

The wolves more likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, and less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;
Proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kills.&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt; However, the extent to which proto-domestic wolves could have become dependent on this way of life prior to domestication and without human provisioning is unclear and highly debated. In contrast, cats may have become fully dependent on a commensal lifestyle before being domesticated by preying on other commensal animals, such as rats and mice, without any human provisioning. Debate over the extent to which some wolves were commensal with humans prior to domestication stems from debate over the level of human intentionality in the domestication process, which remains untested.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=hulmebeaman2016/&gt;

The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotenization of skull morphology&lt;ref name=morey1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=trut1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt; and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth,&lt;ref name=turnbull1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt; which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression.&lt;ref name=trut1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt; This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

A mitochondrial, microsatellite, and Y-chromosome assessment of two wolf populations in North America combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou and another territorial ecotype population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Although these two populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence.&lt;ref name=musiani2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

A different study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene [[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]] with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these remains were derived from a population of specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived.&lt;ref name=leonard2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.&lt;ref name=wolpert2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

===''Aspergillus'' and ''Staphylococcus''===
{{See also|Aspergillus|Staphylococcus}}
Numerous genera of [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] live on and in the human body as part of its natural flora. The fungal genus ''[[Aspergillus]]'' is capable of living under considerable environmental stress, and thus is capable of colonising the upper gastrointestinal tract where relatively few examples of the body's gut flora can survive due to highly acidic or alkaline conditions produced by gastric acid and digestive juices. While ''Aspergillus'' normally produces no symptoms, in individuals who are immunocompromised or suffering from existing conditions such as [[tuberculosis]], a condition called [[aspergillosis]] can occur, in which populations of ''Aspergillus'' grow out of control.

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', a common bacterial species, is known best for its numerous pathogenic strains that can cause numerous illnesses and conditions. However, many strains of ''S. aureus'' are metabiotic commensals, and are present on roughly 20 to 30% of the human population as part of the [[skin flora]].&lt;ref name=pmid9227864/&gt; ''S. aureus'' also benefits from the variable ambient conditions created by the body's mucous membranes, and as such can be found in the [[oral cavity|oral]] and [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]], as well as inside the [[ear canal]]. Other ''Staphylococcus'' species including ''[[Staphylococcus warneri|S. warneri]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus lugdunensis|S. lugdunensis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'', will also engage in commensalism for similar purposes.

=== ''Nitrosomonas'' spp and ''Nitrobacter'' spp ===
Commensalistic relationships between microorganisms include situations in which the waste product of one microorganism is a substrate for another species. One good example is nitrification-the oxidation of ammonium ion to nitrate. Nitrification occurs in two steps: first, bacteria such as ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' spp. and certain [[crenarchaeota|crenarchaeote]]s oxidize ammonium to nitrite; and second, nitrite is oxidized to nitrate by ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' spp. and similar bacteria. ''Nitrobacter'' spp. benefit from their association with ''Nitrosomonas'' spp. because they use nitrite to obtain energy for growth.

Commensalistic associations also occur when one microbial group modifies the environment to make it better suited for another organism. The synthesis of acidic waste products during [[fermentation]] stimulates the proliferation of more acid-tolerant microorganisms, which may be only a minor part of the microbial community at neutral pH. A good example is the succession of microorganisms during milk spoilage.

[[Biofilm]] formation provides another example. The colonization of a newly exposed surface by one type of microorganism (an initial colonizer) makes it possible for other microorganisms to attach to the microbially modified surface.

=== Octocorals and Brittle Stars ===

In deep-sea, benthic environments there is an associative relationship between octocorals and brittle Stars. Due to the currents flowing upward along seamount ridges, atop these ridges there are colonies of suspension feeding corals and sponges, and brittle stars that grip tight to them and get up off the sea floor. A specific documented commensal relationship is between the ophiuran Ophiocreas oedipus Lyman and the octocoral primnoid Metallogorgia melanotrichos.

Historically, commensalism has been recognized as the usual type of association between brittle stars and octocorals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21962750/ | pmid=21962750 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385529-9.00002-0 | title=Biology of deep-water octocorals | journal=Advances in Marine Biology | year=2011 | volume=60 | pages=41–122 | last1=Watling | first1=Les | last2=France | first2=Scott C. | last3=Pante | first3=Eric | last4=Simpson | first4=Anne | isbn=9780123855299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this association, the ophiurans benefit directly by being elevated through facilitating their feeding by suspension, while the octocorals do not seem to benefit or be harmed by this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24844596 | jstor=24844596 | title=Size structure of dense populations of the brittle star Ophiura sarsii (Ophiuroidea: Echinodermata) in the bathyal zone around Japan | last1=Fujita | first1=Toshihiko | last2=Ohta | first2=Suguru | journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series | year=1990 | volume=64 | issue=1/2 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.3354/meps064113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies in the Gulf of Mexico have suggested that there are actually some benefits to the octocorals, such as receiving a cleaning action by the brittle star as it slowly moves around the coral.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps_oa/m549p089.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a close relationship occurs between cohabiting species, with the interaction beginning from their juvenile stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mejía-Quintero |first1=Katherine |last2=Borrero-Pérez |first2=Giomar H. |last3=Montoya-Cadavid |first3=Erika |title=Callogorgia spp. and Their Brittle Stars: Recording Unknown Relationships in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea |journal=Frontiers in Marine Science |date=2021 |volume=8 |doi=10.3389/fmars.2021.735039 |issn=2296-7745|doi-access=free }} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments ==

Whether the relationship between humans and some types of [[gut flora]] is commensal or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] is still unanswered.

Some biologists argue that any close interaction between two organisms is unlikely to be completely neutral for either party, and that relationships identified as commensal are likely [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[parasitism|parasitic]] in a subtle way that has not been detected. For example, [[epiphytes]] are "nutritional pirates" that may intercept substantial amounts of nutrients that would otherwise go to the host plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Benzing DH | date = 1980 | title = Biology of the Bromeliads | location = [[Eureka, California]] | publisher = Mad River Press}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of epiphytes can also cause tree limbs to break or shade the host plant and reduce its rate of photosynthesis. Similarly, phoretic mites may hinder their host by making flight more difficult, which may affect its aerial hunting ability or cause it to expend extra energy while carrying these passengers.

Like all ecological interactions, commensalisms vary in strength and duration from intimate, long-lived [[symbiosis|symbioses]] to brief, weak interactions through intermediaries.

=== Phoresy ===

[[Phoresis (biology)|Phoresy]] is one animal attached to another exclusively for transport, mainly [[arthropod]]s, examples of which are [[mite]]s on [[insect]]s (such as [[beetle]]s, [[fly|flies]] or [[bee]]s), [[pseudoscorpion]]s on [[mammal]]s&lt;ref name=jstor2388309/&gt; or beetles, and [[millipede]]s on [[bird]]s.&lt;ref name="Karel et al 2001"/&gt; Phoresy can be either obligate or facultative (induced by environmental conditions).

=== Inquilinism ===
[[Image:Tillandsia bourgaei.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inquilinism: ''[[Tillandsia bourgaei]]'' growing on an oak tree in Mexico]]

[[Inquilinism]] is the use of a second organism for permanent housing. Examples are [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[plant]]s (such as many [[orchid]]s) that grow on trees,&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Commensalism?topic=58074 ''Commensalism''. Topic Ed. M.Mcginley. Ed-in-chief C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; or birds that live in holes in trees.

=== Metabiosis ===

Metabiosis is a more indirect dependency, in which one organism creates or prepares a suitable environment for a second. Examples include [[maggots]], which develop on and infest corpses, and [[hermit crab]]s, which use [[gastropod]] shells to protect their bodies.

* [[Parasitism]] &amp;ndash; where one organism benefits at the expense of another organism.
* [[Parabiosis]] &amp;ndash; where both organisms occupy the same dwelling, but do not interfere with each other
* [[Symbiosis]] &amp;ndash; long-term interactions between different biological species, which can be mutualistic, commensal or parasitic

A '''commissure''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ə|ʃ|ər}}) is the location at which two objects [[wikt:abut#Verb|abut]] or are joined. The term is used especially in the fields of anatomy and biology.

* The most common usage of the term refers to the brain's commissures, of which there are five. Such a commissure is a bundle of [[commissural fiber]]s as a [[nerve tract|tract]] that crosses the midline at its level of origin or entry (as opposed to a [[decussation]] of fibers that cross obliquely). The five are the [[anterior commissure]], [[posterior commissure]], [[corpus callosum]], [[Fornix (neuroanatomy)#Commissure|commissure of fornix]] (hippocampal commissure), and [[habenular commissure]]. They consist of fibre [[Neural pathway|tract]]s that connect the two [[cerebral hemisphere]]s and span the [[longitudinal fissure]]. In the spinal cord there are the [[anterior white commissure]], and the [[gray commissure]]. ''Commissural neurons'' refer to [[neuron|neuronal cells]] that grow their [[axon|axons]] across the midline of the nervous system within the brain and the spinal cord.
* ''Commissure'' also often refers to cardiac anatomy of [[heart valve]]s. In the heart, a commissure is the area where the valve leaflets abut. When such an abutment is abnormally stiffened or even fused, [[stenosis#Valvular|valvular stenosis]] results, sometimes requiring [[commissurotomy]].
* The term may also refer to the junction of the upper and lower [[lip]]s (see [[labial commissure of mouth]]).
* It may refer to the junction of the upper and lower mandibles of a [[beak|bird's beak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Field and General Ornithology |first=Elliott |last=Coues |year=1890 |publisher=Macmillan and Co |location=London |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU8aAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Handbook+of+Field+and+General+Ornithology&amp;pg=PA1 |oclc=263166207}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternately, to the full-length apposition of the closed mandibles, from the corners of the mouth to the tip of the beak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Campbell |editor-first= Bruce |editor2-last= Lack |editor2-first= Elizabeth |title=A Dictionary of Birds |year=1985 |publisher=T and A D Poyser |location=Carlton, England |page=105 |isbn=0-85661-039-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It may refer to the nasal and temporal meeting points of the upper and lower [[eyelid]]s (the medial and lateral [[canthi]]).
* In female genitalia, the joining points of the two folds of the labia majora create two commissures - the anterior commissure just anterior to the prepuce of the clitoris, and the posterior commissure of the labia majora, directly posterior to the frenulum of the labia minora and anterior to the perineal raphe.

In [[biology]], the meeting of the two valves of a [[brachiopod]] or [[clam]] is a commissure; in [[botany]], the term is used to denote the place where a [[fern]]'s laterally expanded vein endings come together in a continuous marginal [[sorus]].

A '''comparator system''', or simply '''comparator''', in the fields of [[biophysics]], [[biology]], and [[neurology]] is a particular organisation of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This page lists the different DNA sequencing services. 
2 main types can be distinguished:
* [[Whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) services
* [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) sequencing services

[[Exome sequencing|Whole exome sequencing]] is the middle ground between these two types, where a large amount of genes are sequenced, but only those that produce meaningful differences important for practical purposes, which is only 1% of the whole genome.

Both allow people to detect the presence of hereditary diseases (and/or other imperfections) in their DNA, and (when WGS) is used, it even allows people to know the specifics of their hereditary diseases (and/or other imperfections). These specifics can be important, as in many cases, it's not a single gene that causes the disease, but rather a combination of genes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acmg.net/docs/acmg_releases_highly-anticipated_recommendations_on_incidental_findings_in_clinical_exome_and_genome_sequencing.pdf Page 25: several genes often responsible for a same disease]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the exact gene is not even known, but only the [[Locus (genetics)|approximate location]] where the imperfect [[nucleotides]] are situated is known.

[[File:Bird War 1 (67158617).jpeg|thumb|300px|[[Great egret]] and [[neotropic cormorant]] competing over territory]]

'''Competition''' is an [[Biological interaction|interaction]] between [[organism]]s or [[species]] in which both require a [[Resource (biological)|resource]] that is in [[Limiting factor|limited]] supply (such as [[food]], [[water]], or [[Territory (animal)|territory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Begon, M.; Harper, J. L.; Townsend, C. R. (1996) ''[[Ecology: Individuals, populations and communities]]'' Blackwell Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition lowers the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of both organisms involved since the presence of one of the organisms always reduces the amount of the resource available to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Competition|url=https://globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/competition/competition.html|access-date=2021-12-08|website=globalchange.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[community ecology]], competition within and between members of a [[species]] is an important [[biological interaction]]. Competition is one of many interacting [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors that affect [[Community (ecology)|community]] structure, species diversity, and [[population dynamics]] (shifts in a population over time).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Species Interactions and Competition {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/species-interactions-and-competition-102131429/|access-date=2021-12-08|website=www.nature.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] of competition: interference, exploitation, and apparent competition (in order from most direct to least direct). Interference and exploitation competition can be classed as "real" forms of competition, while apparent competition is not, as organisms do not share a resource, but instead share a predator.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Competition among members of the same species is known as [[intraspecific competition]], while competition between individuals of different species is known as [[interspecific competition]].

According to the [[competitive exclusion principle]], species less suited to compete for resources must either [[Adaptation|adapt]] or [[Extinction|die out]], although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; According to [[evolutionary theory]], competition within and between species for resources is important in [[natural selection]]. More recently, however, researchers have suggested that evolutionary biodiversity for vertebrates has been driven not by competition between organisms, but by these animals adapting to colonize empty livable space; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sahney|first1=Sarda|last2=Benton|first2=Michael J.|last3=Ferry|first3=Paul A.|date=2010-08-23|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interference competition ==

[[File:Hirschkampf.jpg|thumb|Male-male competition in [[red deer]] during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] is an example of interference competition within a species.]]

During interference competition, also called contest competition, organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources. For example, large [[aphid]]s defend feeding sites on [[Populus angustifolia|cottonwood]] leaves by ejecting smaller aphids from better sites. Male-male competition in [[red deer]] during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] is an example of interference competition that occurs within a species.

Interference competition occurs directly between individuals via [[aggression]] when the individuals interfere with the foraging, survival, and reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in a portion of the habitat. An example of this can be seen between the ant ''[[Novomessor cockerelli]]'' and [[Pogonomyrmex barbatus|red harvester ants]], where the former interferes with the ability of the latter to forage by plugging the entrances to their [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] with small rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Barton|first1=Kasey E.|last2=Sanders|first2=Nathan J.|last3=Gordon|first3=Deborah M.|date=2002-10-01|title=The Effects of Proximity and Colony Age on Interspecific Interference Competition between the Desert Ants Pogonomyrmex barbatus and Aphaenogaster cockerelli|url=https://bioone.org/journals/the-american-midland-naturalist/volume-148/issue-2/0003-0031_2002_148_0376_TEOPAC_2.0.CO_2/The-Effects-of-Proximity-and-Colony-Age-on-Interspecific-Interference/10.1674/0003-0031(2002)148[0376:TEOPAC]2.0.CO;2.full|journal=The American Midland Naturalist|volume=148|issue=2|pages=376–382|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2002)148[0376:TEOPAC]2.0.CO;2|s2cid=7668877 |issn=0003-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male [[bowerbird]]s, who create elaborate structures called ''bowers'' to attract potential mates, may reduce the fitness of their neighbors directly by stealing decorations from their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borgia|first=Gerald|date=1985|title=Bower Destruction and Sexual Competition in the Satin Bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus)|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4599867|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=91–100|doi=10.1007/BF00299037|jstor=4599867|s2cid=36871646|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In animals, interference competition is a strategy mainly adopted by larger and stronger organisms within a habitat. As such, populations with high interference competition have adult-driven generation cycles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At first, the growth of juveniles is stunted by larger adult competitors. However, once the juveniles reach adulthood, they experience a secondary growth cycle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Plants, on the other hand, primarily engage in interference competition with their neighbors through [[allelopathy]], or the production of biochemicals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Interference competition can be seen as a strategy that has a clear cost (injury or death) and benefit (obtaining resources that would have gone to other organisms).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Case|first1=Ted J.|last2=Gilpin|first2=Michael E.|date=August 1974|title=Interference Competition and Niche Theory|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=71|issue=8|pages=3073–3077|doi=10.1073/pnas.71.8.3073|issn=0027-8424|pmid=4528606|pmc=388623|bibcode=1974PNAS...71.3073C|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to cope with strong interference competition, other organisms often either do the same or engage in exploitation competition. For example, depending on the season, larger ungulate red deer males are competitively dominant due to interference competition. However, does and fawns have dealt with this through temporal resource partitioning — foraging for food only when adult males are not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=David B|last2=Martin|first2=James A|last3=Cohen|first3=Bradley S|last4=Prebyl|first4=Thomas J|last5=Killmaster|first5=Charlie|last6=Miller|first6=Karl V|date=2018-07-06|title=Intraspecific temporal resource partitioning at white-tailed deer feeding sites|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/cz/zoy051|journal=Current Zoology|volume=65|issue=2|pages=139–146|doi=10.1093/cz/zoy051|issn=2396-9814|pmc=6430969|pmid=30936902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploitation competition ==
Exploitation competition, or [[scramble competition]], occurs indirectly when organisms both use a common [[limiting resource]] or shared food item. Instead of fighting or exhibiting aggressive behavior in order to win resources, exploitative competition occurs when resource use by one organism depletes the total amount available for other organisms. These organisms might never interact directly but compete by responding to changes in resource levels. Very obvious examples of this phenomenon include a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] species and a nocturnal species that nevertheless share the same resources or a plant that competes with neighboring plants for light, nutrients, and space for root growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=A. L.|date=1987-02-01|title=Simple models for exploitative and interference competition|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800%2887%2990093-7|journal=Ecological Modelling|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=113–121|doi=10.1016/0304-3800(87)90093-7|hdl=2027.42/26823|issn=0304-3800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schenk|first=H. Jochen|date=2006-03-24|title=Root competition: beyond resource depletion: Root competition: beyond resource depletion|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01124.x|journal=Journal of Ecology|language=en|volume=94|issue=4|pages=725–739|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01124.x|s2cid=86320966 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of competition typically rewards those organisms who claim the resource first. As such, exploitation competition is often size-dependent and smaller organisms are favored since smaller organisms typically have higher foraging rates.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Le Bourlot|first1=Vincent|last2=Tully|first2=Thomas|last3=Claessen|first3=David|date=2014-11-01|title=Interference versus Exploitative Competition in the Regulation of Size-Structured Populations.|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/678083|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=184|issue=5|pages=609–623|doi=10.1086/678083|pmid=25325745|s2cid=206002300|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since smaller organisms have an advantage when exploitative competition is important in an ecosystem, this mechanism of competition might lead to a juvenile-driven generation cycle: individual juveniles succeed and grow fast, but once they mature they are outcompeted by smaller organisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In plants, exploitative competition can occur both above- and below ground. Aboveground, plants reduce the fitness of their neighbors by vying for sunlight  [[plants]] consume [[nitrogen]] by [[Nitrogen assimilation|absorbing]] it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. Plants that produce many roots typically reduce [[Nitrogen fixation|soil nitrogen]] to very low levels, eventually killing neighboring plants.

Exploitative competition has also been shown to occur both within species (intraspecific) and between different species (interspecific). Furthermore, many competitive interactions between organisms are some combination of exploitative and interference competition, meaning the two mechanisms are far from mutually exclusive. For example, a recent 2019 study found that the native thrip species ''Frankliniella intonsa'' was competitively dominant over an invasive thrip species ''Frankliniella occidentalis'' because it not only exhibited greater time feeding (exploitative competition) but also greater time guarding its resources (interference competition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bhuyain|first1=Mohammad Mosharof Hossain|last2=Lim|first2=Un Taek|date=2019-06-14|title=Interference and Exploitation Competition between Frankliniella occidentalis and F. intonsa (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) in Laboratory Assays|url=https://bioone.org/journals/florida-entomologist/volume-102/issue-2/024.102.0206/Interference-and-Exploitation-Competition-between-Frankliniella-occidentalis-and-F-intonsa/10.1653/024.102.0206.full|journal=Florida Entomologist|volume=102|issue=2|pages=322–328|doi=10.1653/024.102.0206|s2cid=196662034|issn=0015-4040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants may also exhibit both forms of competition, not only scrambling for space for root growth but also directly inhibiting other plants' development through allelopathy.

== Apparent competition ==

Apparent competition occurs when two otherwise unrelated prey species indirectly compete for survival through a shared [[Predation|predator]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Robert D.|date=1977-10-01|title=Predation, apparent competition, and the structure of prey communities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0040-5809%2877%2990042-9|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=197–229|doi=10.1016/0040-5809(77)90042-9|pmid=929457|issn=0040-5809}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of competition typically manifests in new equilibrium abundances of each prey species. For example, suppose there are two species (species A and species B), which are preyed upon by food-limited predator species C. Scientists observe an increase in the abundance of species A and a decline in the abundance of species B. In an apparent competition model, this relationship is found to be mediated through predator C; a population explosion of species A increases the abundance of predator species C due to a greater total food source. Since there are now more predators, species A and B would be hunted at higher rates than before. Thus, the success of species A was to the detriment of species B — not because they competed for resources, but because their increased numbers had indirect effects on the predator population.

This one-predator/two-prey model has been explored by ecologists as early as 1925, but the term "apparent competition" was first coined by University of Florida ecologist Robert D. Holt in 1977.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schreiber|first1=Sebastian J.|last2=Křivan|first2=Vlastimil|date=2020-06-01|title=Holt (1977) and apparent competition|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580919301716|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|series=Fifty years of Theoretical Population Biology|language=en|volume=133|pages=17–18|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2019.09.006|pmid=31711965|s2cid=207952477|issn=0040-5809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt found that field ecologists at the time were erroneously attributing negative interactions among prey species to [[niche partitioning]] and [[Competitive exclusion principle|competitive exclusion]], ignoring the role of food-limited predators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Apparent competition and realized niche ===
Apparent competition can help shape a species' [[realized niche]], or the area the species can ''actually'' persist due to interspecific interactions. The effect on realized niches could be incredibly strong, especially when there is an absence of more traditional interference or exploitative competition. A real-world example was studied in the late 1960s, when the introduction of snowshoe hares (''[[Snowshoe hare|Lepus americanus]]'') to Newfoundland reduced the habitat range of native arctic hares (''[[Arctic hare|Lepus arcticus]]''). While some ecologists hypothesized that this was due to an overlap in the niche, other ecologists argued that the more plausible mechanism was that snowshoe hare populations led to an explosion in food-limited [[lynx]] populations, a shared predator of both prey species. Since the arctic hare has a relatively weaker defense tactic than the snowshoe hare, they were excluded from woodland areas on the basis of differential predation. However, both apparent competition and exploitation competition might help explain the situation to some degree.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Asymmetric apparent competition ===
Apparent competition can be symmetric or asymmetric.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Holt|first1=Robert D.|last2=Bonsall|first2=Michael B.|date=2017-11-02|title=Apparent Competition|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022628|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=447–471|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022628|issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symmetric apparent competition negatively impacts both species equally (-,-), from which it can be inferred that both species will persist. However, asymmetric apparent competition occurs when one species is affected less than the other. The most extreme scenario of asymmetric apparent competition is when one species is not affected at all by the increase in the predator, which can be seen as a form of amensalism (0, -).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chaneton|first1=Enrique J.|last2=Bonsall|first2=Michael B.|date=2000|title=Enemy-Mediated Apparent Competition: Empirical Patterns and the Evidence|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3547034|journal=Oikos|volume=88|issue=2|pages=380–394|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880217.x|jstor=3547034|issn=0030-1299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human impacts on endangered prey species have been characterized by conservation scientists as an extreme form of asymmetric apparent competition, often through [[Introduced species|introducing]] predator species into ecosystems or resource subsidies. An example of fully asymmetric apparent competition which often occurs near urban centers is subsidies in the form of human garbage or waste. In the early 2000s, the common raven (''[[Common raven|Corvus corax]]'') population in the [[Mojave Desert]] increased due to an influx of human garbage, leading to an indirect negative effect on juvenile desert tortoises (''[[Desert tortoise|Gopherus agassizii]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=DeCesare|first1=N. J.|last2=Hebblewhite|first2=M.|last3=Robinson|first3=H. S.|last4=Musiani|first4=M.|date=2010|title=Endangered, apparently: the role of apparent competition in endangered species conservation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00328.x|journal=Animal Conservation|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=353–362|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00328.x|s2cid=83416826 |issn=1469-1795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apparent competition in the human microbiome ===
Apparent competition has also been viewed in and on the human body. The human immune system can acts as the generalist predator, and a high abundance of a certain bacteria may induce an immune response, damaging all pathogens in the body. Another example of this is of two populations of bacteria that can both support a predatory bacteriophage. In most situations, the one that is most resistant to infection by the shared predator will replace the other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Apparent competition has also been suggested as an exploitable phenomenon for cancer treatments. Highly specialized viruses that are developed to target malignant cancer cells often go locally extinct prior to eradicating all cancer. However, if a virus were developed that targets both healthy and unhealthy host cells to some degree, the large number of healthy cells would support the predatory virus for long enough to eliminate all malignant cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Size-asymmetric competition ==
{{Main|Size-asymmetric competition}}

Competition can be either [[Size-asymmetric competition|complete symmetric]] (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size), [[Size-asymmetric competition|perfectly size symmetric]] (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass), or absolutely [[Size-asymmetric competition|size-asymmetric]] (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource).

Among plants, size asymmetry is context-dependent and competition can be both asymmetric and symmetric depending on the most limiting resource. In forest stands, below-ground competition for nutrients and water is size-symmetric, because a tree's root system is typically proportionate to the biomass of the entire tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=West|first1=P. W.|last2=Ratkowsky|first2=D. A.|date=2021-10-04|title=Problems with models assessing influences of tree size and inter-tree competitive processes on individual tree growth: a cautionary tale|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11676-021-01395-9|journal=Journal of Forestry Research|volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=565–577 |language=en|doi=10.1007/s11676-021-01395-9|s2cid=244202914|issn=1993-0607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, above-ground competition for light is size-asymmetric — since light has directionality, the forest canopy is dominated entirely by the largest trees. These trees disproportionately exploit most of the resource for their biomass, making the interaction size asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pretzsch|first1=Hans|last2=Biber|first2=Peter|date=2010-02-15|title=Size-symmetric versus the size-asymmetric competition and growth partitioning among trees in forest stands along an ecological gradient in central Europe|url=https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/X09-195|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=40|issue=2|pages=370–384|doi=10.1139/x09-195|issn=0045-5067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether above-ground or below-ground resources are more limiting can have major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities; in mixed beech stands, for example, size-asymmetric competition for light is a stronger predictor of growth compared with competition for soil resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=del Río|first1=Miren|last2=Condés|first2=Sonia|last3=Pretzsch|first3=Hans|date=2014-08-01|title=Analyzing size-symmetric vs. size-asymmetric and intra- vs. inter-specific competition in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) mixed stands|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112714002011|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|language=en|volume=325|pages=90–98|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2014.03.047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within and between species==
{{See also|Female intrasexual competition}}
[[File:Clone war of sea anemones 2-17-08-2.jpg|thumb|[[Sea anemones]] compete for the territory in [[tide pools]]]]
Competition can occur between individuals of the same species, called intraspecific competition, or between different species, called interspecific competition. Studies show that intraspecific competition can regulate population dynamics (changes in population size over time). This occurs because individuals become crowded as the population grows. Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited. Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce. This reduces population size and slows population growth.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Species also interact with other species that require the same resources. Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species populations at the same time. Experiments demonstrate that when species compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct. These experiments suggest that competing species cannot coexist (they cannot live together in the same area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Intraspecific===

{{Main|Intraspecific competition}}
Intraspecific competition occurs when members of the same species compete for the same [[Natural resource|resource]]s in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Townsend2008"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Townsend, Colin R. |author2=Begon, Michael  | title=Essentials of Ecology | year=2008 | pages=103–105 | isbn=978-1-4051-5658-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple example is a stand of equally-spaced plants, which are all of the same age. The higher the [[Plant density|density of plants]], the more plants will be present per unit ground area, and the stronger the competition will be for resources such as light, water, or nutrients.

===Interspecific===

{{Main|Interspecific competition}}
Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered [[fecundity]], growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter [[population]]s, communities, and the evolution of interacting species. An example among animals could be the case of [[cheetah]]s and [[lion]]s; since both species feed on similar prey, they are negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food, however, they still persist together, despite the prediction that under competition one will displace the other. In fact, lions sometimes steal prey items killed by cheetahs.  Potential competitors can also kill each other, in so-called '[[intraguild predation]]'.  For example, in southern California coyotes often kill and eat gray foxes and bobcats, all three carnivores sharing the same stable prey (small mammals).&lt;ref&gt;.Fedriani, J. M., T. K. Fuller, R. M. Sauvajot and E. C. York. 2000. Competition and intraguild predation among three sympatric carnivores. [[Oecologia]], 125:258-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example among protozoa involves ''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' and ''[[Paramecium caudatum]].'' Russian ecologist, [[Georgy Gause]], studied the competition between the two species of ''Paramecium'' that occurred as a result of their coexistence. Through his studies, Gause proposed the [[Competitive exclusion principle]], observing the competition that occurred when their different ecological niches overlapped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgy Gause|Gause, G.F.]] (1934). ''The struggle for existence''. Baltimore, MD: Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition has been observed between individuals, populations, and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. For example, mammals lived beside reptiles for many millions of years of time but were unable to gain a competitive edge until dinosaurs were devastated by the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Evolutionary strategies ==
{{Main|r/K selection theory|Verhulst equation}}

In evolutionary contexts, competition is related to the concept of r/K selection theory, which relates to the [[Natural selection|selection]] of [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s which promote success in particular environments. The theory originates from work on [[island biogeography]] by the ecologists [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R.]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson, E. O.]] (1967). ''The Theory of Island Biogeography'', [[Princeton University Press]] (2001 reprint), {{ISBN|0-691-08836-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[r/K selection theory]], selective pressures are hypothesized to drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: ''r''- or ''K''-selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Pianka|Pianka, E. R.]] (1970). On r and K selection. ''[[American Naturalist]] '104' '', 592-597.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, r, and K, are derived from standard ecological [[algebra]], as illustrated in the simple [[Verhulst equation#Verhulst equation|Verhulst equation]] of [[population dynamics]]:&lt;ref name=Verhulst&gt;[[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst, P. F.]] (1838). Notice sur la loi que la population pursuit dans son accroissement. ''Corresp. Math. Phys. '10' '', 113-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right) \qquad \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the [[Population growth rate|growth rate]] of the [[population]] (''N''), and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of its local environmental setting. Typically, r-selected species exploit empty [[Ecological niche|niches]], and produce many [[offspring]], each of whom has a relatively low [[probability]] of surviving to adulthood. In contrast, K-selected species are strong competitors in crowded niches, and [[Parental investment|invest]] more heavily in much fewer offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Verhulst/&gt;

== Competitive exclusion principle ==
[[File:Competitive-20Exclusion-20Principle.svg|thumb|1: a smaller (yellow) species of bird forages across whole tree.&lt;br&gt;2: a larger (red) species competes for resources.&lt;br&gt;3: red dominates in middle for the more abundant resources. Yellow adapts to a new niches, avoiding competition.]]
{{main|Competitive exclusion principle}}

To explain how species coexist, in 1934 [[Georgii Gause]] proposed the [[competitive exclusion principle]] which is also called the Gause principle: species cannot coexist if they have the same [[ecological niche]]. The word "niche" refers to a species' requirements for survival and reproduction. These requirements include both resources (like food) and proper [[habitat]] conditions (like temperature or pH). Gause reasoned that if two species had identical niches (required identical resources and habitats) they would attempt to live in exactly the same area and would compete for exactly the same resources. If this happened, the species that was the best competitor would always exclude its competitors from that area. Therefore, species must at least have slightly different niches in order to coexist.&lt;ref name=hardin60&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardin, Garrett |title=The competitive exclusion principle |journal=Science |volume=131 |pages=1292–1297 |issue=3409 |year=1960 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/seminars/hardin.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 |pmid=14399717|bibcode=1960Sci...131.1292H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocheville2015&gt;{{cite book | last=Pocheville | first=Arnaud | year=2015 | chapter=The Ecological Niche: History and Recent Controversies | chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/6188833 | editor1-last=Heams | editor1-first=Thomas | editor2-last=Huneman | editor2-first=Philippe | editor3-last=Lecointre | editor3-first=Guillaume |display-editors=3 | editor4-last=Silberstein | editor4-first=Marc | title=Handbook of Evolutionary Thinking in the Sciences | location=Dordrecht | publisher=Springer | publication-date=2015 | pages=547–586 | isbn=978-94-017-9014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character displacement ==
[[File:Geospiza fortis.jpg|thumbnail|left|Medium ground finch ([[Geospiza fortis]]) on Santa Cruz Island in the [[Galapagos Islands|Galapagos]]]]
{{main|Character displacement}}

Competition can cause species to evolve differences in traits. This occurs because the individuals of a species with traits similar to competing species always experience strong interspecific competition. These individuals have less reproduction and survival than individuals with traits that differ from their competitors. Consequently, they will not contribute many offspring to future generations. For example, [[Darwin's finches]] can be found alone or together on the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Both species populations actually have more individuals with intermediate-sized beaks when they live on islands without the other species present. However, when both species are present on the same island, competition is intense between individuals that have intermediate-sized beaks of both species because they all require intermediate-sized seeds. Consequently, individuals with small and large beaks have greater survival and reproduction on these islands than individuals with intermediate-sized beaks. Different finch species can coexist if they have traits—for instance, beak size—that allow them to specialize in particular resources. When ''[[Geospiza fortis]]'' and ''[[Geospiza fuliginosa]]'' are present on the same island, ''G. fuliginosa'' tends to evolve a small beak and ''G. fortis'' a large beak. The observation that competing species' traits are more different when they live in the same area than when competing species live in different areas is called character displacement. For the two finch species, beak size was displaced: Beaks became smaller in one species and larger in the other species. Studies of character displacement are important because they provide evidence that competition is important in determining ecological and evolutionary patterns in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, W. L., and [[E. O. Wilson]]. 1956. "Character displacement". ''Systematic Zoology'' 5:49–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

When one species has even the slightest advantage over another, the one with the advantage will dominate in the long term. This leads either to the extinction of the weaker competitor or to an [[evolution]]ary or behavioral shift toward a different [[ecological niche]]. The principle has been paraphrased in the maxim "complete competitors can not coexist".&lt;ref name="hardin60"/&gt;

==History==
The competitive exclusion principle is classically attributed to [[Georgy Gause]],&lt;ref name=gause1934&gt;{{cite book | last=Gause | first=Georgii Frantsevich | year=1934 | title=The Struggle For Existence | edition=1st | location=Baltimore | publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins | url=http://www.ggause.com/Contgau.htm | access-date=2016-11-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128142418/http://www.ggause.com/Contgau.htm | archive-date=2016-11-28 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he actually never formulated it.&lt;ref name=hardin60&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garrett Hardin |title=The competitive exclusion principle |journal=Science |volume=131 |pages=1292–1297 |issue=3409 |year=1960 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/seminars/hardin.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 |pmid=14399717 |bibcode=1960Sci...131.1292H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is already present in Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name=Pocheville2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=darwin1859&gt;{{cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles | year=1859 | title=On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | edition=1st | location=London | publisher=John Murray | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 | isbn=1-4353-9386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, the status of the principle has oscillated between ''a priori'' ('two species coexisting ''must'' have different niches') and experimental truth ('we find that species coexisting do have different niches').&lt;ref name=Pocheville2015/&gt;

==Experimental basis==

[[File:Graph of competitive exclusion principle.jpg|thumb|''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' and ''[[Paramecium caudatum]]'' grow well individually, but when they compete for the same resources, ''P. aurelia'' outcompetes ''P. caudatum''.]]

Based on field observations, [[Joseph Grinnell]] formulated the principle of competitive exclusion in 1904: "Two species of approximately the same food habits are not likely to remain long evenly balanced in numbers in the same region. One will crowd out the other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Grinnell | first1=J. | year=1904 | title=The Origin and Distribution of the Chestnut-Backed Chickadee | journal=[[The Auk]] | volume=21 | issue=3 | pages=364–382 | publisher=American Ornithologists' Union | jstor=4070199 | url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/7930 | doi=10.2307/4070199}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgy Gause]] formulated the law of competitive exclusion based on laboratory competition experiments using two species of ''[[Paramecium]]'', ''P. aurelia'' and ''P. caudatum''. The conditions were to add fresh water every day and input a constant flow of food. Although ''P. caudatum'' initially dominated, ''P. aurelia'' recovered and subsequently drove ''P. caudatum'' extinct via exploitative [[Resource (biology)|resource]] competition. However, Gause was able to let the ''P. caudatum'' survive by differing the environmental parameters (food, water). Thus, Gause's law is valid only if the ecological factors are constant.

Gause also studied competition between two species of yeast, finding that ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' consistently outcompeted ''[[Schizosaccharomyces kefir]]''{{clarify|date=July 2018}} by producing a higher concentration of [[ethyl alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gause | first1 = G.F. | author-link = Georgii Gause | year = 1932 | title = Experimental studies on the struggle for existence: 1.

==Prediction==
[[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of interspecific competition for a single limited resource.gif|thumb|[[Cellular automaton]] model of interspecific competition for a single limited resource]]

Competitive exclusion is predicted by mathematical and theoretical models such as the [[Lotka–Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra model]]s of competition. However, for poorly understood reasons, competitive exclusion is rarely observed in natural [[ecosystem]]s, and many biological communities appear to violate Gause's law. The best-known example is the so-called "[[paradox of the plankton]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=George Evelyn |date=1961 |title=The paradox of the plankton |journal=American Naturalist |volume=95 |issue=882 |pages=137–145 |doi=10.1086/282171|s2cid=86353285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[plankton]] species live on a very limited number of resources, primarily [[solar energy]] and minerals dissolved in the water. According to the competitive exclusion principle, only a small number of plankton species should be able to coexist on these resources. Nevertheless, large numbers of plankton species coexist within small regions of open sea.

Some communities that appear to uphold the competitive exclusion principle are [[Robert H. MacArthur|MacArthur]]'s [[warbler]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacArthur | first1 = R.H. | s2cid = 45585254 | author-link = Robert MacArthur | year = 1958 | title = Population ecology of some warblers of northeastern coniferous forests | journal = Ecology | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 599–619 | doi=10.2307/1931600| jstor = 1931600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Darwin's finches]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lack | first1 = D.L. | author-link = David Lack | year = 1945 | title = The Galapagos finches (Geospizinae); a study in variation | journal = Occasional Papers of the California Academy of Sciences | volume = 21 | pages = 36–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the latter still overlap ecologically very strongly, being only affected negatively by competition under extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De León | first1 = LF | last2 = Podos | first2 = J | last3 = Gardezi | first3 = T | last4 = Herrel | first4 = A | last5 = Hendry | first5 = AP | date = Jun 2014 | title = Darwin's finches and their diet niches: the sympatric coexistence of imperfect generalists | journal = J Evol Biol | volume = 27 | issue = 6| pages = 1093–104 | doi = 10.1111/jeb.12383 | pmid = 24750315 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxical traits==

A partial solution to the paradox lies in raising the dimensionality of the system. Spatial [[heterogeneity]], trophic interactions, multiple [[resource]] [[competition]], [[competition-colonization trade-off]]s, and lag may prevent exclusion (ignoring stochastic extinction over longer time-frames). However, such systems tend to be analytically intractable. In addition, many can, in theory, support an unlimited number of species. A new paradox is created: Most well-known models that allow for stable coexistence allow for unlimited number of species to coexist, yet, in nature, any community contains just a handful of species.

==Redefinition==

Recent studies addressing some of the assumptions made for the models predicting competitive exclusion have shown these assumptions need to be reconsidered. For example, a slight modification of the assumption of how growth and body size are related leads to a different conclusion, namely that, for a given ecosystem, a certain range of species may coexist while others become outcompeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rastetter | first1 = E.B. | last2 = Ågren | first2 = G.I. | year = 2002 | title = Changes in individual allometry can lead to coexistence without niche separation | journal = Ecosystems | volume = 5 | pages = 789–801 | doi=10.1007/s10021-002-0188-3| s2cid = 30089349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moll | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Brown | first2 = J.S. | year = 2008 | title = Competition and Coexistence with Multiple Life-History Stages | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 171 | issue = 6| pages = 839–843 | doi=10.1086/587517| pmid = 18462131 | s2cid = 26151311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary ways niche-sharing species can coexist is the [[competition-colonization trade-off]]. In other words, species that are better competitors will be specialists, whereas species that are better colonizers are more likely to be generalists. Host-parasite models are effective ways of examining this relationship, using host transfer events. There seem to be two places where the ability to colonize differs in ecologically closely related species. In feather lice, Bush and Clayton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = D.H. | last2 = Bush | first2 = S.E. | year = 2006 | title = The role of body size in host specificity: Reciprocal transfer experiments with feather lice | journal = Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 10| pages = 2158–2167 | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2006.tb01853.x| pmid = 17133872 | s2cid = 221734637 }}&lt;/ref&gt; provided some verification of this by showing two closely related genera of lice are nearly equal in their ability to colonize new host pigeons once transferred. Harbison&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harbison | first1 = C.W. | year = 2008 | title = Comparative transmission dynamics of competing parasite species | journal = Ecology | volume = 89 | issue = 11| pages = 3186–3194 | doi=10.1890/07-1745.1| pmid = 31766819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; continued this line of thought by investigating whether the two genera differed in their ability to transfer. This research focused primarily on determining how colonization occurs and why wing lice are better colonizers than body lice. Vertical transfer is the most common occurrence, between parent and offspring, and is much-studied and well understood. Horizontal transfer is difficult to measure, but in lice seems to occur via phoresis or the "hitchhiking" of one species on another. Harbison found that body lice are less adept at phoresis and excel competitively, whereas wing lice excel in colonization.

==Phylogenetic context==

An [[Ecology|ecological]] community is the assembly of species which is maintained by ecological (Hutchinson, 1959;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=G. E.|date=1959|title=Homage to Santa Rosalia or Why Are There So Many Kinds of Animals?|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=93|issue=870|pages=145–159|issn=0003-0147|jstor=2458768|doi=10.1086/282070|s2cid=26401739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibold, 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leibold|first=MATHEW A.|date=1998-01-01|title=Similarity and local co-existence of species in regional biotas|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=95–110|doi=10.1023/A:1006511124428|s2cid=6678357|issn=1573-8477}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and evolutionary process (Weiher and Keddy, 1995;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Weiher|first1=Evan|last2=Keddy|first2=Paul A.|date=1995|title=The Assembly of Experimental Wetland Plant Communities|journal=Oikos|volume=73|issue=3|pages=323–335|doi=10.2307/3545956|issn=0030-1299|jstor=3545956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase ''et al''., 2003). These two processes play an important role in shaping the existing community and will continue in the future (Tofts ''et al''., 2000; Ackerly, 2003; Reich ''et al''., 2003). In a local community, the potential members are filtered first by environmental factors such as temperature or availability of required resources and then secondly by its ability to co-exist with other resident species.

In an approach of understanding how two species fit together in a community or how the whole community fits together, ''The Origin of Species''  ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], 1859) proposed that under homogeneous environmental condition struggle for existence is greater between closely related species than distantly related species. He also hypothesized that the functional traits may be conserved across phylogenies. Such strong phylogenetic similarities among closely related species are known as phylogenetic effects (Derrickson ''et al''., 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Derrickson|first1=E. M.|last2=Ricklefs|first2=R. E.|date=1988|title=Taxon-Dependent Diversification of Life-History Traits and the Perception of Phylogenetic Constraints|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=2|issue=3|pages=417–423|doi=10.2307/2389415|issn=0269-8463|jstor=2389415}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

With field study and mathematical models, ecologist have pieced together a connection between functional traits similarity between species and its effect on species co-existence. According to competitive-relatedness hypothesis (Cahil ''et al''., 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cahill|first1=James F.|last2=Kembel|first2=Steven W.|last3=Lamb|first3=Eric G.|last4=Keddy|first4=Paul A.|date=2008-03-12|title=Does phylogenetic relatedness influence the strength of competition among vascular plants?|journal=Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics|volume=10|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.1016/j.ppees.2007.10.001|issn=1433-8319}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis (Violle ''et al''., 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Violle|first1=Cyrille|last2=Nemergut|first2=Diana R.|last3=Pu|first3=Zhichao|last4=Jiang|first4=Lin|date=2011|title=Phylogenetic limiting similarity and competitive exclusion|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=14|issue=8|pages=782–787|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01644.x|pmid=21672121|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt;) interspecific competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 5696386|year = 2017|last1 = Tarjuelo|first1 = R.|title = Intraspecific and interspecific competition induces density‐dependent habitat niche shifts in an endangered steppe bird|journal = Ecology and Evolution|volume = 7|issue = 22|pages = 9720–9730|last2 = Morales|first2 = M.

Hence, it causes reduction in the number of closely related species and even distribution of it, known as phylogenetic overdispersion (Webb ''et al''., 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=Campbell O.|last2=Ackerly|first2=David D.|last3=McPeek|first3=Mark A.|last4=Donoghue|first4=Michael J.|date=2002|title=Phylogenies and Community Ecology|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=33|issue=1|pages=475–505|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150448}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The reverse of phylogenetic overdispersion is phylogenetic clustering in which case species with conserved functional traits are expected to co-occur due to  environmental filtering (Weiher ''et al''., 1995; Webb, 2000). In the study performed by Webb ''et al''., 2000, they showed that a small-plots of Borneo forest contained closely related trees together. This suggests that closely related species share features that are favored by the specific environmental factors that differ among plots causing phylogenetic clustering.

For both phylogenetic patterns (phylogenetic overdispersion and phylogenetic clustering), the baseline assumption is that phylogenetically related species are also ecologically similar (H. Burns et al., 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Jean H.|last2=Strauss|first2=Sharon Y.|date=2011-03-29|title=More closely related species are more ecologically similar in an experimental test|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=108|issue=13|pages=5302–5307|doi=10.1073/pnas.1013003108|issn=0027-8424|pmid=21402914|pmc=3069184|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.5302B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There are no significant number of experiments answering to what degree the closely related species are also similar in niche. Due to that, both phylogenetic patterns are not easy to interpret. It’s been shown that phylogenetic overdispersion may also result from convergence of distantly related species (Cavender-Bares ''et al.'' 2004;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author-link1=Jeannine Cavender-Bares|last1=Cavender-Bares|first1=J.|last2=Ackerly|first2=D.

In their study, they have shown that traits are convergent rather than conserved. While, in another study, it’s been shown that phylogenetic clustering may also be due to historical or bio-geographical factors which prevents species from leaving their ancestral ranges. So, more phylogenetic experiments are required for understanding the strength of species interaction in community assembly.

==Application to humans==

Evidence showing that the competitive exclusion principle operates in human groups has been reviewed and integrated into [[Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures|regality theory]] to explain warlike and peaceful societies.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, hunter-gatherer groups surrounded by other hunter-gatherer groups in the same [[ecological niche]] will fight, at least occasionally, while hunter-gatherer groups surrounded by groups with a different means of subsistence can coexist peacefully.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bothriochloa bladhii kz01.jpg|thumb|264x264px|Bothriochloa bladhii (Bothriochloa intermedia), an example of a compilospecies]]
Compilospecies were first described by Harlan and de Wet in 1962, who examined a wide range of grasses and other species such as  ''[[Bothriochloa intermedia]]'', otherwise known as Australian bluestem grass. ''B. intermedia'' was found to introgress heavily with neighboring sympatric grass species and even genera, particularly in geographically restricted areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The species itself is of hybrid origin, containing genetic material from five or more different grass species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harlan and de Wet examined the interactions between the genera ''[[Bothriochloa]], [[Dichanthium]] and [[Capillipedium]]'' - an [[apomictic]] complex of grasses from the tribe [[Andropogoneae]] - and used the [[cytogenetic]] model of these as a basis for the compilospecies concept.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant cytogenetics|last=Singh, Ram J.|date=2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420038507|edition=2nd|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|oclc=122938650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species within these genera exhibit both sexual and asexual reproduction, high [[Zygosity|heteriozygosity]], ploidies from 2x to 6x, and gene flow between bordering populations as evidence of ongoing introgression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, this [[gene flow]] is only made possible in the presence of ''B. intermedia'', which introgression moves towards, and the absence of which keeps the other species [[Reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Taxonomy of Angiosperms|last=Sambamurty|first=A.

According to Baianu ''et al''.  CSB is a field that has only a partial overlap with the more conventional concepts of [[complex systems theory]] and [[systems biology]], because CSB is concerned with philosophy and human consciousness. Moreover, [[mathematics]] can model a wide range of [[complex systems]], but this is claimed not to be relevant.&lt;ref name="springerlink"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baianu | first1 = I.

Regarding [[ontology]] (the philosophical [[metaphysics]] of reality), one is assuming that there is a [[hierarchy]] of complexity levels of organization distinct from reality.&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 2001a | title = The Basic Problem of the Theory of Levels of Reality | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4| pages = 261–283 | doi = 10.1023/A:1015845217681 | s2cid = 55743057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 1998 | title = Levels | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 9 | issue = 1–2| pages = 197–211 | doi=10.1007/bf02681712| pmid = 8053082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Baianu ''et al''. claim that taxonomic ranks such as [[Order (biology)|order]], [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], [[species]], etc. reflect a hierarchy of complexity levels of organization in biology.&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;

Because of their variability, ability to heal and self-reproduce, and so on, organisms are defined as '[[meta-system]]s' of simpler systems in CSB.&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Metasystem&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-system is a system of systems.&lt;ref name=Metasystem/&gt; [[Autopoiesis]] also models such a biological system of systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; however, Baianu ''et al''. claim that in biology a meta-system is not equivalent to such a system of systems.&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt; They also claim it differs from the meta-system defined in a blog by Kent D. Palmer&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net/incosewg/ppframe.htm Meta-system Engineering], Kent D. Palmer, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoff, M.A., Roggia, K.G., Menezes, P.B.:(2004).

The segmentation algorithm partitioned the sequence and correctly identified 4 domains as compositionally homogeneous domains and 2 compositionally nonhomogeneous domains.{{Primary source inline|date=May 2012}}]]

A '''compositional domain''' in [[genetics]] is a region of [[DNA]] with a distinct [[guanine]] (G) and [[cytosine]] (C) G-C and C-G content (collectively [[GC content]]).&lt;ref name=pmid20571085&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkq532 |title=Identifying compositionally homogeneous and nonhomogeneous domains within the human genome using a novel segmentation algorithm |year=2010 |last1=Elhaik |first1=Eran |last2=Graur |first2=Dan |last3=Josić |first3=Krešimir |last4=Landan |first4=Giddy |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=38 |issue=15 |pages=e158 |pmid=20571085 |pmc=2926622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homogeneity of compositional domains is compared to that of the chromosome on which they reside. As such, compositional domains can be homogeneous or nonhomogeneous domains. Compositionally homogeneous domains that are sufficiently long (= 300 kb) are termed [[isochore (genetics)|isochores]] or isochoric domains.

The '''compositional domain model''' was proposed as an alternative to the [[isochoric model]]. The isochore model was proposed by Bernardi and colleagues to explain the observed non-uniformity of genomic fragments in the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.4001930 |title=The mosaic genome of warm-blooded vertebrates |year=1985 |last1=Bernardi |first1=G |last2=Olofsson |first2=B |last3=Filipski |first3=J |last4=Zerial |first4=M |last5=Salinas |first5=J |last6=Cuny |first6=G |last7=Meunier-Rotival |first7=M |last8=Rodier |first8=F |journal=Science |volume=228 |issue=4702 |pages=953–8 |pmid=4001930|bibcode = 1985Sci...228..953B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent sequencing of complete genomic data refuted the isochoric model. Its main predictions were:

* GC content of the third codon position (GC3) of protein coding genes is correlated with the GC content of the isochores embedding the corresponding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00644-8 |title=Misunderstandings about isochores.

The '''Conference on Semantics in Healthcare and Life Sciences''' ('''CSHALS''') was a scientific meeting on the practical applications of [[semantic technology]] to pharmaceutical R&amp;D, healthcare, and life sciences. The conference was held annually from 2008 to 2014, and was the premier meeting in this domain. In 2015, it was organised as a special interests group (SIG) meeting of the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] conference.&lt;ref name="cshals-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 by cshals|url=https://cshals.github.io/2015/#section|website=cshals.github.io|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference topics included a [[World Wide Web Consortium]] tutorial on [[semantic web]] standards.&lt;ref name="w3c-tutorial"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSHALS Tutorial {{!}} Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences (HCLS) Interest Group|url=https://www.w3.org/blog/hcls/2010/02/02/cshals_tutorial/|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, CSHALS took on the additional topic of the application of [[Big data|Big Data]] to healthcare and life sciences, while maintaining its previous focus on semantic technologies.

'''Connect''' is a non-profit serving the San Diego and Southern California region.  Connect elevates innovators and entrepreneurs throughout their growth journey by providing educational programming, mentorship, networking events, and access to capital.  The current CEO is Mike Krenn.

==Background==
Founded at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UC San Diego), Connect spun out of the university in 2005.  Connect was founded in 1985 by [[Irwin M. Jacobs]], co-founder and board member of Qualcomm Incorporated; Richard Atkinson, president emeritus, University of California (and former chancellor, UC San Diego); Lea Rudee, founding dean, UC San Diego School of Engineering; [[Mary Lindenstein Walshok]], associate vice chancellor of extended studies and public programs at UC San Diego; Buzz Woolley, president of Girard Capital/Girard Foundation; David Hale, chairman of Hale BioPharma Ventures LLC; Dan Pegg, former president and CEO of San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation; and Bob Weaver of Deloitte &amp; Touche.&lt;ref name="UCSanDiegoExtensionAHistory2010" /&gt;

In 1986 UC San Diego recruited William (Bill) Otterson, chairman and CEO of Cipher Data Products, to head Connect.&lt;ref name="UCSanDiegoExtensionInnovationTimeline2010" /&gt;  Over the following 13 years, Otterson built Connect by bringing together local entrepreneurs, academics and out of area venture capitalists through a variety of programs centered on innovation.  Today CONNECT is an internationally renowned program that has now been modeled in almost 40 regions around the world including New York City,&lt;ref name="StateoftheCityAddress2010p4" /&gt; the UK, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Australia.&lt;ref name="GlobalCONNECTMembers2010" /&gt;

In May 2019, Connect merged with San Diego Venture Group (SDVG), led by then SDVG President, Mike Krenn.
==Programs==
Connect offers programs in the areas of research institution support, access to capital, entrepreneur mentorship, business development, and education on capital structure.  Connect's lead program is Springboard, which offers free hands-on mentoring by veterans for innovators at the innovation, technology transfer, commercialization, transition and international expansion stages.  Springboard has been recognized as a model by the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref name="HelpingTechnologies2010" /&gt; and ''Entrepreneur Magazine''.&lt;ref name="ANewTakeonIncubators2010" /&gt;

==Founder credentials==
In 2005 CONNECT was a co-founder of the Wireless Life Sciences Alliance,&lt;ref name="Sobrian2010" /&gt; in 2008 CONNECT founded CleanTECH San Diego,&lt;ref name="CleanTechSanDiego2010" /&gt; and in 2009 founded San Diego Sport Innovators, now headed by [[Bill Walton]].&lt;ref name="ConnectEntertainment2010" /&gt;

San Diego Sport Innovators was created in 2008 by Camille Sobrian and Marco Thompson by partnering with sponsor Dick Kintz from Shepard Mulin law firm.  Sports industry veterans, Peter "PT" Townsend, Ludo Boinnard and Jim Stroesser were added as the founding boarding members.  Other board members include:  Dana Shertz, Michael Brower, Bob Rief, Tony Finn, Mark Schmid, John Sarkisian, Brian Enge, Dave Nash, John Wilson, Dave Down, Jeff Kearl, and Kevin Flanagan.  Former NBA great, Bill Walton, was brought in as the chairman in 2009.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

==Awards==
The highest award CONNECT gives entrepreneurs is the Entrepreneur Hall of Fame Award.  This award is given to those Connect deems community leaders through influence in life science and technology based businesses in San Diego.  These businesses are viewed by Connect as significant contributions to San Diego's economy and quality of life, relying on the "Hall of Fame" entrepreneurs for their success.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Those given the award include: Irwin Jacobs, co-founder, board member and former chairman and CEO, [[Qualcomm Incorporated]]; [[Walter Zable]], co-founder, chairman and CEO of [[Cubic Corporation]]; [[John Robert Beyster|Robert Beyster]], founder and former chairman and CEO of [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] and chairman of The Foundation for Enterprise Development; Ivor Royston, co-founder of [[Hybritech]] (San Diego's first biotechnology company) and managing member of Forward Ventures; [[William Rastetter]], former president and CEO of [[IDEC Pharmaceuticals]] (merged with [[Biogen]] to become [[Biogen Idec]], the third largest biotechnology company in the world); and Neal Blue, chairman and CEO of [[General Atomics]] (GA), Linden Blue, vice chairman of GA and chairman of [[Spectrum Aeronautical]],&lt;ref name="ConnectEntrepreneurHallofFame2010" /&gt; and Peter Preuss, founder of [[ISSCO]].&lt;ref name="PeterPreuss2010" /&gt;

The [[conservation ethic]] is based on the findings of conservation biology.

== Origins ==
[[File:Hopetoun falls.jpg|thumb|300px|Efforts are made to preserve the natural characteristics of [[Hopetoun Falls]], Australia, without affecting visitors' access.]]
The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in La Jolla, California, in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and [[Michael E. Soulé]] with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including [[Kurt Benirschke]], Sir [[Otto Frankel]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], and [[Jared Diamond]]. The meeting was prompted by the concern over [[tropical deforestation]], disappearing species, eroding [[genetic diversity]] within species.&lt;ref&gt;J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. Kat Williams . 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference and proceedings that resulted&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80/&gt; sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and [[evolutionary genetics]] on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soulé, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance [[conservation genetics]] as a new field at the time. [[Jared Diamond]], who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and [[Thomas Lovejoy]], who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at [[World Wildlife Fund]], felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term  ''conservation biology'', complementing Frankel's conception and coining of "conservation genetics",  to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soulé and Wilcox wrote conceived the agenda for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6–9, 1978, titled ''First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology'', in which the program described "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and [[National Environmental Policy Act|policy]].  The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, [[conservation behavior]] and conservation physiology.&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooke |first1=S. J. |last2=Sack |first2=L. |last3=Franklin |first3=C. E. |last4=Farrell |first4=A. P. |last5=Beardall |first5=J. |last6=Wikelski |first6=M. |last7=Chown |first7=S.

== Description ==

The rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a "Discipline with a deadline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, Edward Osborne |title=The future of life |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-316-64853-0 }}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation biology is tied closely to [[ecology]] in researching the [[population ecology]] ([[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], [[wikt:migration|migration]], [[demographics]], [[effective population size]], [[inbreeding depression]], and [[minimum viable population|minimum population viability]]) of [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Indigenous Uses, Population Density, and Conservation of Threatened Medicinal Plants in Protected Areas of the Indian Himalayas |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=368–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00602.x |jstor=3591249 |s2cid=85324142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of [[biodiversity loss]], species [[extinction]]s, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession advocate for a global response to [[Holocene extinction|the current biodiversity crisis]] based on [[morals]], [[ethics]], and scientific reason. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.&lt;ref name="Soule86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; There is increasing recognition that conservation is not just about what is achieved but how it is done.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cooke |first1=S.

=== Natural resource conservation ===
Conscious efforts to conserve and protect ''global'' biodiversity are a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|title=Biodiversity protection and preservation|website=ffem.fr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018140452/http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|archive-date=2016-10-18|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hardin G |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–8 |date=December 1968 |pmid=5699198 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection.

From this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; For example, the Alaskan [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] peoples and the [[Haida people|Haida]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of [[sockeye salmon]].

The Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary clinics.

Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings. There are examples in the [[Tao]], [[Shinto]], [[Hindu]], [[Islamic]] and [[Buddhist]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Primack 2004"&gt;{{cite book | last = Primack | first = Richard B. | title = A Primer of Conservation Biology, 3rd ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/primerofconserva00rich/page/320 320pp] | isbn = 978-0-87893-728-8 | url = https://archive.org/details/primerofconserva00rich/page/320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture [[land degradation]]: "What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, E., and H.

=== Early naturalists ===

[[Natural history]] was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. By 1900 there were 150 [[natural history museum]]s in [[Germany]], 250 in [[Great Britain]], 250 in the [[United States]], and 300 in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Farber00"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Finding order in nature: the naturalist tradition from Linnaeus to E.

Before Charles Darwin set sail on HMS ''Beagle'', most people in the world, including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology|last=Mader|first=Sylvia|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-0-07-802426-9|location=New York, NY|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species' ancestors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The thinking of these early 18th century naturalists helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalists.

By the early 19th century [[biogeography]] was ignited through the efforts of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/biology/macisaac/55-437/intro.htm|title=Introduction to Conservation Biology and Biogeography|website=web2.uwindsor.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors.&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt; Although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and [[Environmental organization|conservation organizations]], their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt;

=== Conservation movement ===
{{Main|Conservation movement}}

The modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period particularly in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cloyd"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cloyd | first = E. L. | year = 1972 | title = James Burnett, Lord Monboddo | location = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 196 | isbn = 978-0-19-812437-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of thinkers, among them notably [[Lord Monboddo]],&lt;ref name="Cloyd" /&gt; described the importance of "preserving nature"; much of this early emphasis had its origins in [[Christian theology]].

Scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first1=Greg |last1=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=978-1-139-43460-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108213227/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 8, 2007|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|access-date=2009-03-09|work=[[The Hindu]]|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

The term ''conservation'' came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as [[timber]], fish, game, [[topsoil]], [[pasture]]land, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of [[forest]]s ([[forestry]]), [[wildlife]] ([[wildlife refuge]]), parkland, [[wilderness]], and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. This period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869]] was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author1=G.

In May 1912, a month after the ''Titanic'' sank, banker and expert naturalist [[Charles Rothschild]] held a meeting at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London to discuss his idea for a new organisation to save the best places for wildlife in the British Isles. This meeting led to the formation of the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, which later became the [[Wildlife Trusts]].

In the [[United States]], the [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] gave the President power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain. [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892, and the [[New York Zoological Society]] was set up in 1895. A series of [[National Park|national forests and preserves]] were established by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] from 1901 to 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-and-conservation.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation - Theodore Roosevelt National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223142405/http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-02-23 |title=Environmental timeline 1890–1920 |website=runet.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1916 National Parks Act, included a 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir, which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Davis96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Peter |title=Museums and the natural environment: the role of natural history museums in biological conservation |url=https://archive.org/details/museumsnaturalen0000davi |url-access=registration |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-7185-1548-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global conservation efforts ===

In the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in [[big cat]] conservation in [[South America]] led by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Rabinowitz, ''Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve'', Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., [[Carl E. Akeley]], [[Archie Carr]] and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carr, Marjorie Harris |author2=Carr, Archie Fairly |title=A naturalist in Florida: a celebration of Eden |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalistinflor0000carr |url-access=registration |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-300-05589-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm|title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: (Henry) Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|website=www.wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=the story of the virungas |url=http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/mgorilla/mgeuropean.html |access-date=2022-07-10 |website=www.cotf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The timings of these two sentences contradict each other. --&gt; Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the [[Virunga Mountains]] and observed the [[mountain gorilla]] in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading [[Albert I of Belgium]] to act in defense of the [[mountain gorilla]] and establish [[Albert National Park]] (since renamed [[Virunga National Park]]) in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, C., 1923. ''In Brightest Africa'' New York, Doubleday. 188-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the [[Endangered Species Act]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. § 136, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA) of Canada, [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s developed in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531-|title=16 U.S. Code § 1531 - Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1966) and [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+42USC4321|title=US Government Publishing Office - FDsys - Browse Publications|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul R. |last1=Krausman |first2=A. J. T. |last2=Johnsingh |year=1990 |title=Conservation and Wildlife Education in India |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=342–7 |jstor=3782224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the [[urban wildlife|urban conservation]] movement. A local organization was established in [[Birmingham]], [[UK]], a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a [[grassroots movement]], its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] originated in 1985.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

By 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227072411/http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently many countries began programmes of [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] and the [[Society for the Environment]].

Since 2000, the concept of [[landscape scale conservation]] has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.

Ecology has clarified the workings of the [[biosphere]]; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The [[Human overpopulation|burgeoning human population]] and associated [[agriculture]], [[Industrial sector|industry]], and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gore, Albert |title=Earth in the balance: ecology and the human spirit |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-395-57821-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/earthinbalanceec00gore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation biologists measure and apply [[statistical measure]]s of [[fossil record]]s,&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regan |first1=Helen M. |last2=Lupia |first2=Richard |last3=Drinnan |first3=Andrew N. |last4=Burgman |first4=Mark A. |title=The Currency and Tempo of Extinction |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2001 |pmid=18707231 |doi=10.1086/317005 |s2cid=205983813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rates of [[habitat loss]], and a multitude of other variables such as [[loss of biodiversity]] as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKenzie |first1=Darryl I. |last2=Nichols |first2=James D. |last3=Hines |first3=James E. |last4=Knutson |first4=Melinda G. |last5=Franklin |first5=Alan B. |title=Estimating Site Occupancy, Colonization, and Local Extinction When a Species Is Detected Imperfectly |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |issue=8 |year=2003 |pages=2200–2207 |jstor=3450043 |doi=10.1890/02-3090 |hdl=2027.42/149732 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain such estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balmford |first1=Andrew |last2=Green |first2=Rhys E. |last3=Jenkins |first3=Martin |title=Measuring the changing state of nature |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=326–30 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00067-3 |url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucessjb/S3%20Reading/balmford%20et%20al%202003.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur|first1=R.H.|author-link1= Robert MacArthur|last2=Wilson|first2=E.O.|author-link2= E.

The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)&lt;ref name="Wilson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edward O. | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x| s2cid = 83906221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to how many have received a [[Binomial nomenclature|species binomial]] (estimated range: 1.5-8 million).&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond simply noting its existence.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of [[vertebrate]]s, 5% of [[invertebrate]]s and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as [[endangered]] or [[threatened]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630054235/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from [[critically endangered]] or threatened for the purpose of these statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Better knowledge is being constructed by [[The Plant List]] for actual numbers of species.

=== Systematic conservation planning ===

Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Margules CR, Pressey RL |title=Systematic conservation planning |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6783 |pages=243–53 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10821285 |doi=10.1038/35012251 |s2cid=4427223 |url=http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225013400/http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |archive-date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
# Identify conservation goals for the planning region
# Review existing conservation areas
# Select additional conservation areas
# Implement conservation actions
# Maintain the required values of conservation areas

Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for [[Grant (money)|grant proposals]] or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf Amphibian Conservation Action Plan] is one example. See also: {{cite journal |vauthors=Chan KM, Shaw MR, Cameron DR, Underwood EC, Daily GC |title=Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Services |journal=PLOS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e379 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17076586 |pmc=1629036 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of [[Geographic Information Systems]] to assist in the decision making process. The [[SLOSS debate]] is often considered in planning.

=== Conservation physiology: a mechanistic approach to conservation ===

Conservation physiology was defined by [[Steven J. Cooke]] and colleagues as: "An integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes, plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations, restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support tools, and manage natural resources."&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"/&gt;  Conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines.

=== Conservation biology as a profession ===

The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[economics]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[anthropology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt; Within biology, [[conservation genetics]] and [[evolution]] are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.

Conservationists introduce [[bias]] when they support policies using qualitative description, such as [[Habitat degradation|habitat ''degradation'']], or ''healthy'' [[ecosystem]]s. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of [[science]], [[reason]], [[logic]], and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] in their conservation management plans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt; This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.

There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manolis JC, Chan KM, Finkelstein ME, Stephens S, Nelson CR, Grant JB, Dombeck MP |title=Leadership: A new frontier in conservation science |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=879–86 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01150.x |pmid=19183215 |s2cid=36810103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an [[adaptive management]] approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopoldleadership.org/content/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217231043/http://leopoldleadership.org/content|archive-date=2007-02-17|title=Aldo Leopold Leadership Program|publisher=Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===

Conservation may be classified as either [[in-situ conservation]], which is protecting an endangered species in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], or [[ex-situ conservation]], which occurs outside the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Medicinal plants conservation and enterprise development |journal=Medicinal Plants - International Journal of Phytomedicines and Related Industries |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=79–95 |doi=10.5958/j.0975-4261.1.2.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a [[Environmentalism|preservationist]] method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans.{{quote|text=|sign=|source=|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence the diversity of tetrapods will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."}}

=== Ethics and values ===
{{See also|Conservation (ethic)|Land ethic}}

Conservation biologists are [[interdisciplinary]] researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states&lt;ref name="Chan08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Kai M. A. |title=Value and Advocacy in Conservation Biology: Crisis Discipline or Discipline in Crisis? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18254846 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00869.x |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.

A conservationist may be inspired by the ''resource conservation ethic'',&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|15}} which seeks to identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt;{{Rp|13}} In contrast, some conservation biologists argue that nature has an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that is independent of [[anthropocentric]] usefulness or [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|3,12,16–17}} [[Aldo Leopold]] was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |access-date=2013-10-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archive-date=2014-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Vié09"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last1 =Vié  |editor-first1 = J. C. |editor-last2 =Hilton-Taylor  |editor-first2 =C. |editor-last3 =Stuart  |editor-first3 = S.N. | year =2009 | title =Wildlife in a Changing World – An Analysis of the 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species | location =Gland, Switzerland | publisher =IUCN | page =180 | url =http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/RL-2009-001.pdf | access-date =December 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than the dramatic rates of species loss, however, conservation scientists note that the sixth mass extinction is a biodiversity crisis requiring far more action than a priority focus on [[Rare species|rare]], [[Endemism|endemic]] or [[endangered species]]. Concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at [[ecological processes]], such as migration, and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species, including genetic, population and ecosystem diversity.&lt;ref name="Molnar04"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Molnar |first1 = J. |last2 = Marvier |first2 = M. |last3 = Kareiva |first3 = P. |title = The sum is greater than the parts |journal = Conservation Biology |volume = 18 |issue = 6 |pages = 1670–1 |year = 2004 |doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive, systematic, and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity. While the [[conservation status]] of species is employed extensively in conservation management,&lt;ref name="Vié09" /&gt; some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Gaston10"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1182818 | last=Gaston | first=K.J. | title=Valuing common species | journal=Science | volume=327 | issue=5962 | pages=154–155 | year=2010 | pmid=20056880 |bibcode = 2010Sci...327..154G | s2cid=206523787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearns10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kearns |first1=Carol Ann |year=2010 |title=Conservation of Biodiversity |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=7 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/conservation-of-biodiversity-13235087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of [[sustainability|sustaining biodiversity]],&lt;ref name="CREOcare"&gt;Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "[http://creo.amnh.org/care.html Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?]". URL accessed July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving ''[[biodiversity hotspots]]'', some scientists (e.g)&lt;ref name="Luck03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luck |first1=Gary W. |last2=Daily |first2=Gretchen C. |last3=Ehrlich |first3=Paul R. |title=Population diversity and ecosystem services |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=331–6 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00100-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conservation organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], argue that it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in ''biodiversity coldspots''.&lt;ref name="Conserving Biodiversity Coldspots"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kareiva |first1=Peter |last2=Marvier |first2=Michelle |title=Conserving Biodiversity Coldspots |journal=American Scientist |volume=91 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=344–51 |doi=10.1511/2003.4.344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.&lt;ref name="Molnar04" /&gt;

Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, "... 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Norman |last2=Mittermeier |first2=Russell A. |last3=Mittermeier |first3=Cristina G. |last4=da Fonseca |first4=Gustavo A. B. |last5=Kent |first5=Jennifer |title=Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6772 |pages=853–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10706275 |doi=10.1038/35002501 |bibcode=2000Natur.403..853M |s2cid=4414279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the Earth's ecosystems where [[biomass]], not biodiversity, reigns supreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Underwood EC, Shaw MR, Wilson KA |title=Protecting Biodiversity when Money Matters: Maximizing Return on Investment |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e1515 |year=2008 |pmid=18231601 |pmc=2212107 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001515 |bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.1515U |editor1-last=Somers |editor1-first=Michael |display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 36% of the Earth's surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the endemic species to qualify as biodiversity hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leroux SJ, Schmiegelow FK |title=Biodiversity concordance and the importance of endemism |journal=Conserv.

Summary of 2006 [[IUCN Red List]] categories

Those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|title= The Biodiversity Hotspots|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222043456/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date= 2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IUCN Red List categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their Wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale.{{dubious|date=July 2012}} This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass.&lt;ref name="Wood08" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2012}} Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, ecosystem processes, evolutionary [[adaptation|adaptability]], and biomass.&lt;ref&gt;The following papers are examples of research showing the relationship between biodiversity, biomass, and ecosystem stability:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowen |first=B.

|The ecological credit crunch is a global challenge. The ''Living Planet Report 2008'' tells us that more than three-quarters of the world's people live in nations that are ecological debtors – their national consumption has outstripped their country's biocapacity. Thus, most of us are propping up our current lifestyles, and our economic growth, by drawing (and increasingly overdrawing) upon the ecological capital of other parts of the world.

=== Strategic species concepts ===

==== Keystone species ====
{{Main|Keystone species}}

Some species, called a ''keystone species'' form a central supporting hub unique to their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/keystone-species/|title=keystone species|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=National Geographic Society|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') through its interaction with [[sea otter]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[kelp]]. [[Kelp bed]]s grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the [[food chain]]. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to [[overhunting]], sea urchin populations [[urchin barren|grazed unrestricted]] on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas''. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this was later questioned by Turvey and Risley,&lt;ref name=pmid17148336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turvey |first1=S.T |last2=Risley |first2=C.L |title=Modelling the extinction of Steller's sea cow |journal=Biology Letters |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=94–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17148336 |pmc=1617197 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that hunting alone would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.

==== Indicator species ====
{{Main|Indicator species}}

An ''indicator species'' has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as [[amphibian]]s with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to [[wetland]]s, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a ''[[miner's canary]]''. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest [[silviculture]] treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a [[pesticide]] may impart on the health of an ecosystem.

Government regulators, consultants, or [[NGO]]s regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landres PB, Verner J, Thomas JW |title=Ecological Uses of Vertebrate Indicator Species: A Critique |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=316–28 |year=1988 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/2007_rule/1988_12_Landres%20et%20al%201988.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997&lt;ref name="Meffe97"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carroll, C. Dennis |author2=Meffe, Gary K. |title=Principles of conservation biology |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87893-521-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofcons00meff }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|88–89}}).

==== Umbrella and flagship species ====
{{Main|Umbrella species|Flagship species}}

An example of an ''umbrella species'' is the [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]], because of its lengthy [[Insect migration|migrations]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value. The monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as ''flagship species'', which are species, such as the [[giant panda]], the [[blue whale]], the [[tiger]], the [[mountain gorilla]] and the monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes threatens other species of chief concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fedriani | first1 = JM | last2 = García | first2 = L | last3 = Sanchéz | first3 = M | last4 = Calderon | first4 = J | last5 = Ramo | first5 = C | year = 2017 | title = Long-term impact of protected colonial birds on a jeopardized cork oak population: conservation bias leads to restoration failure | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 450–458 | doi = 10.1111/1365-2664.12672 | hdl = 10261/135920 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These include: the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event|Ordovician]] (440 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), [[Late Devonian extinction|Devonian]] (370 mya), [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] (245 mya), [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] (200 mya), and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (66 mya) extinction spasms. Within the last 10,000 years, human influence over the Earth's ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost;&lt;ref name="Ehrlich"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ehrlich, Anne H. |author2=Ehrlich, Paul R. |title=Extinction: the causes and consequences of the disappearance of species |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-394-51312-6 }}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is to say the rates of [[deforestation]], [[Coral reef destruction|reef destruction]], [[Threats to wetlands|wetland draining]] and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species.

Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. ''[[Coral bleaching]]'' is caused by a mixture of [[environmental stress]]es, including increases in ocean temperatures and [[Ocean acidification|acidity]], causing both the release of [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] and death of corals.&lt;ref name="ausSOE01"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia state of the environment 2001: independent report to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, VIC, Australia |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-643-06745-5 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/report/pubs/part03b.pdf |author=Australian State of the Environment Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years.

The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic [[natural resource]]s. A concern is that the majority of all [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species will not be able to [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[acclimate]] in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society. 2005. Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policy document 12/05. {{ISBN|0-85403-617-2}} [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13539 Download]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "90% of all of the large (average approximately ≥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean"&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving [[multi-cellular organism]]s with only [[microbes]] left to dominate [[marine ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

=== Groups other than vertebrates ===

Serious concerns also being raised about [[Taxonomic rank|taxonomic groups]] that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates. These include [[fungus|fungal]] (including [[lichen]]-forming species),&lt;ref name="fungal-conservation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/blogs/orphans-of-rio.pdf |title=Orphans of Rio |publisher=fungal-conservation.org |access-date=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; invertebrate (particularly [[insect]]&lt;ref name="Koh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=JA |last2=Telfer |first2=MG |last3=Roy |first3=DB |last4=Preston |first4=CD |last5=Greenwood |first5=JJ |last6=Asher |first6=J |last7=Fox |first7=R |last8=Clarke |first8=RT |last9=Lawton |first9=JH |title=Comparative Losses of British Butterflies, Birds, and Plants and the Global Extinction Crisis |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5665 |pages=1879–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15031508 |doi=10.1126/science.1095046 |bibcode=2004Sci...303.1879T |s2cid=22863854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dunn |first1=Robert R. |title=Modern Insect Extinctions, the Neglected Majority |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=19 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=1030–6 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00078.x |s2cid=38218672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[plant]] [[Community (ecology)|communities]] where the vast majority of biodiversity is represented. Conservation of fungi and conservation of insects, in particular, are both of pivotal importance for conservation biology. As mycorrhizal symbionts, and as decomposers and recyclers, fungi are essential for sustainability of forests.&lt;ref name="fungal-conservation" /&gt; The value of insects in the [[biosphere]] is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure of [[species richness]]. The greatest bulk of [[biomass]] on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |title=The Little Things That Run the world (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates) |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=344–6 |jstor=2386020 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1987.tb00055.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samways |first1=Michael J. |title=Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=258–82 |doi=10.1007/BF00056672 |s2cid=43987366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Society, National Geographic. "Honeybee." National Geographic. National Geographic, n.d. Web. 11 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in 16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 [[beekeeper]]s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. [[Pest (organism)|Pests]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[global warming]] are all being considered as possible causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holden |first1=C. |title=Ecology: Report Warns of Looming Pollination Crisis in North America |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |page=397 |year=2006 |pmid=17053115 |doi=10.1126/science.314.5798.397 |s2cid=30877553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stokstad |first1=E. |title=Entomology: The Case of the Empty Hives |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5827 |pages=970–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17510336 |doi=10.1126/science.316.5827.970 |s2cid=170560082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another highlight that links conservation biology to insects, forests, and climate change is the [[mountain pine beetle]] (''Dendroctonus ponderosae'') [[epidemic]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada, which has infested {{convert|470000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of forested land since 1999.&lt;ref name="Running08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Running |first1=S.

=== Conservation biology of parasites ===
{{Main|Conservation biology of parasites}}

A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals; however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.

=== Threats to biodiversity ===
{{Main|Biodiversity threats}}

Today, many threats to biodiversity exist. An acronym that can be used to express the top threats of present-day H.I.P.P.O stands for Habitat Loss, Invasive Species, Pollution, Human Population, and Overharvesting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog030/node/394|title=Threats to Biodiversity {{!}} GEOG 030: Geographic Perspectives on Sustainability and Human-Environment Systems, 2011|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary threats to biodiversity are [[habitat destruction]] (such as [[deforestation]], [[agricultural expansion]], [[Urban planning|urban development]]), and [[overexploitation]] (such as [[wildlife trade]]).&lt;ref name="Ehrlich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freckleton |first1=Rob |last2=Sodhi |first2=Navjot S. |last3=Bickford |first3=David |last4=Diesmos |first4=Arvin C. |last5=Lee |first5=Tien Ming |last6=Koh |first6=Lian Pin |last7=Brook |first7=Barry W. |last8=Sekercioglu |first8=Cagan H. |last9=Bradshaw |first9=Corey J.

{{Conservation status}}

The '''conservation status''' of a [[taxon|group of organisms]] (for instance, a [[species]]) indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become [[Extinction|extinct]] in [[Extinction debt|the near future]]. Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats.  Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels as well as for consumer use.

==International systems==
===IUCN Red List of Threatened Species===
The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria Categories and Criteria] The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 18 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. (2012) [http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf ''IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria: Version 3.1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128190606/http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf |date=2016-01-28 }} Second edition. Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. {{ISBN|9782831714356}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also included are species that have gone extinct since 1500 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee |date=2019 |title=Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria |edition=14 |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/RedListGuidelines.pdf |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term "[[Threatened species|threatened]]" is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.

* [[Extinction|Extinct]] '''(EX)''' – No known living individuals
* [[Extinct in the wild]] '''(EW)''' – Known only to survive in captivity, or as a naturalized population outside its historic range
* [[Critically endangered]] '''(CR)''' – Extremely high risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Endangered species (IUCN status)|Endangered]] '''(EN)''' – Higher risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] '''(VU)''' – High risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Near threatened]] '''(NT)''' – Likely to become endangered in the near future
* [[Conservation Dependent]] '''(CD) ''' – Low risk; is conserved to prevent being near threatened, certain events may lead it to being a higher risk level
* [[Least concern]] '''(LC)''' – Very Low risk; does not qualify for a higher risk category and not likely to be threatened in the near future. Widespread and abundant [[taxa]] are included in this category.
* [[Data deficient]] '''(DD)''' – Not enough data to make an assessment of its risk of extinction
* [[Not evaluated]] '''(NE)''' – Has not yet been evaluated against the criteria.

===The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora===
[[CITES|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)]] aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Many countries require CITES permits when importing plants and animals listed on CITES.

==Multi-country systems==
In the [[European Union]] (EU), the Birds and Habitats Directives are the legal instruments that evaluate the conservation status within the EU of species and habitats.

[[NatureServe conservation status]] focuses on [[Latin America]], the United States, Canada, and the [[Caribbean]]. It has been developed by scientists from [[NatureServe]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and a network of natural heritage programs and data centers. It is increasingly integrated with the IUCN Red List system. Its categories for species include: ''presumed extinct'' (GX), ''possibly extinct'' (GH), ''critically imperiled'' (G1), ''imperiled'' (G2), ''vulnerable'' (G3), ''apparently secure'' (G4), and ''secure'' (G5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=InfoNatura: About the Data: Conservation Status |website=NatureServe.org |date=2007-04-10 |access-date=2013-07-22 |archive-date=2013-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055302/http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system also allows ambiguous or uncertain ranks including ''inexact numeric ranks'' (e.g. G2?), and ''range ranks'' (e.g. G2G3) for when the exact rank is uncertain. NatureServe adds a qualifier for ''captive or cultivated only'' (C), which has a similar meaning to the IUCN Red List ''extinct in the wild'' (EW) status.

The [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation]] is used within the Russian Federation, and also accepted in parts of Africa.

==National systems==
In Australia, the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' (EPBC Act) describes lists of threatened species, ecological communities and threatening processes. The categories resemble those of the 1994 [[IUCN Red List]] Categories &amp; Criteria (version 2.3). Prior to the EPBC Act, a simpler classification system was used by the ''Endangered Species Protection Act 1992''. Some state and territory governments also have their own systems for conservation status. The codes for the Western Australian conservation system are given at [[Declared Rare and Priority Flora List]] (abbreviated to DECF when using in a taxobox).

In Belgium, the Flemish [[Research Institute for Nature and Forest]] publishes an online set of more than 150 nature indicators in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inbo.be/content/homepage_en.asp |title=Research Institute for Nature and Forest |website=Inbo.be |access-date=2013-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201163847/http://www.inbo.be/content/homepage_en.asp |archive-date=2008-12-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] (COSEWIC) is a group of experts that assesses and designates which wild species are in some danger of disappearing from Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosepac.gc.ca/eng/sct5/index_e.cfm |title=Cosewic |publisher=Government of Canada, Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada |access-date=2013-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530070331/http://www.cosepac.gc.ca/eng/sct5/index_e.cfm |archive-date=2013-05-30 |url-status=dead }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA), it is up to the federal government, which is politically accountable, to legally protect species assessed by COSEWIC.

In China, the State, provinces and some counties have determined their key protected wildlife species. There is the China red data book.

In [[Finland]], many species are protected under the Nature Conservation Act, and through the [[EU Habitats Directive]] and EU Birds Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?node=6053&amp;lan=en |title=Protecting species |website=Ymparisto.fi |access-date=2013-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506030946/http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?node=6053&amp;lan=en |archive-date=2013-05-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Federal Agency for Nature Conservation]] publishes "red lists of endangered species".

India has the [[Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, Amended 2003]] and the [[Biological Diversity Act, 2002]].

In Japan, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of Environment]] publishes a Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/english/rdb/rdb_e.html |title=Threatened Species |website=Biodic.go.jp |access-date=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the Dutch [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]] publishes a list of threatened species, and conservation is enforced by the Nature Conservation Act 1998. Species are also protected through the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives.

In New Zealand, the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] publishes the [[New Zealand Threat Classification System]] lists.  {{As of|2008|January}} threatened species or subspecies are assigned one of seven categories: Nationally Critical, Nationally Endangered, Nationally Vulnerable, Declining, Recovering, Relict, or Naturally Uncommon.&lt;ref name="NZTCS08"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Townsend|first1=Andrew J.|last2=de Lange|first2=Peter J.|last3=Duffy|first3=Clinton A.J.|last4=Miskelly|first4=Colin M.|last5=Molloy|first5=Janice|last6=Norton|first6=David A.|title=New Zealand Threat Classification System manual|date=January 2008|publisher=Science &amp; Technical Publishing Department of Conservation|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=9780478143645|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sap244.pdf|access-date=2 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the classification looks only at a national level, many species are unique to New Zealand, and species which are secure overseas are noted as such.

In Russia, the Red Book of Russian Federation came out in 2001, it contains categories defining preservation status for different species. In it there are 8 taxa of amphibians, 21 taxa of reptiles, 128 taxa of birds, and 74 taxa of mammals, in total 231. There are also more than 30 regional red books, for example the red book of the Altaic region which came out in 1994.

In [[South Africa]], the [[South African National Biodiversity Institute]], established under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/acts/2004/a10-04.pdf|title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! - South African Government|website=Info.gov.za|access-date=12 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628042434/http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/acts/2004/a10-04.pdf|archive-date=28 June 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for drawing up lists of affected species, and monitoring compliance with CITES decisions. It is envisaged that previously diverse Red lists would be more easily kept current, both technically and financially.

In [[Thailand]], the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act of BE 2535 defines fifteen [[Reserved animals of Thailand|reserved animal]] species and two classes of protected species, of which hunting, breeding, possession, and trade are prohibited or restricted by law. The National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand)|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment]] is responsible for the regulation of these activities.

In [[Ukraine]], the Ministry of Environment Protection maintains list of endangered species (divided into seven categories from "0" - extinct to "VI" - rehabilitated) and publishes it in the Red Book of Ukraine.

In the [[United States of America]], the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] created the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|Endangered Species List]].

==Consumer guides==
{{Main|Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification}}

Some consumer guides for [[seafood]], such as [[Seafood Watch]], divide fish and other sea creatures into three categories, analogous to conservation status categories:
* Red ("''say no''" or "''avoid''")
* Yellow or orange ("''think twice''", "''good alternatives''" or "''some concerns''")
* Green ("''best seafood choices''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx| title=Seafood Recommendations: Our Seafood Ratings| website=Seafoodwatch.org| access-date=19 June 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619211119/http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx| archive-date=19 June 2014| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The categories do not simply reflect the imperilment of individual species, but also consider the environmental impacts of how and where they are fished, such as through [[bycatch]] or [[Bottom trawling|ocean bottom trawlers]]. Often groups of species are assessed rather than individual species (e.g. [[squid]], [[prawn]]s).

The [[Marine Conservation Society]] has five levels of ratings for seafood species, as displayed on their ''FishOnline'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fishonline.org/ratings | title=Fish ratings | work=FishOnline | publisher=Marine Conservation Society | access-date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="11823" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Conserved name (a protected scientific name)}}
A '''conserved name''' or '''''nomen conservandum''''' (plural '''''nomina conservanda''''', abbreviated as '''''nom. cons.''''') is a scientific name that has specific nomenclatural protection. That is, the name is retained, even though it violates one or more rules which would otherwise prevent it from being legitimate. ''Nomen conservandum'' is a [[Latin]] term, meaning "a name to be conserved". The terms are often used interchangeably, such as by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|''International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants'']] (ICN),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title |title=International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants |edition=Melbourne Code |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' favours the term "''conserved name''".

The process for conserving botanical names is different from that for zoological names. Under the botanical code, names may also be "suppressed", '''''nomen rejiciendum''''' (plural '''''nomina rejicienda''''' or '''''nomina utique rejicienda''''', abbreviated as '''''nom. rej.'''''), or rejected in favour of a particular conserved name, and combinations based on a suppressed name are also listed as “''nom. rej.''”.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Botany ==
===Conservation===
In botanical nomenclature, '''conservation''' is a nomenclatural procedure governed by Article&amp;nbsp;14 of the ICN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHAPTER II STATUS, TYPIFICATION, AND PRIORITY OF NAMES SECTION 4 LIMITATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRIORITY ARTICLE 14 |url=https://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/pages/main/art_14.html |website=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |access-date=14 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is 
:"to avoid disadvantageous nomenclatural changes entailed by the strict application of the rules, and especially of the [[Principle of Priority|principle of priority]] [...]" (Art.&amp;nbsp;14.1).
Conservation is possible only for names at the rank of [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] or [[species]].

It may effect a change in original spelling, [[Type (biology)|type]], or (most commonly) priority.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* Conserved spelling ('''''orthographia conservanda''''', '''''orth. cons.''''') allows spelling usage to be preserved even if the name was published with another spelling: ''[[Euonymus]]'' (not ''Evonymus''), ''[[Guaiacum]]'' (not ''Guajacum''),  etc. (see [[orthographical variant]]). 
* Conserved types ('''''typus conservandus''''', '''''typ. cons.''''') are often made when it is found that a type in fact belongs to a different taxon from the description, when a name has subsequently been generally misapplied to a different taxon, or when the type belongs to a small group separate from the monophyletic bulk of a taxon.
* Conservation of a name against an earlier taxonomic (heterotypic) synonym (which is termed a '''rejected name''', '''''nomen rejiciendum''''', '''''nom. rej.''''') is relevant only if a particular taxonomist includes both types in the same taxon.

===Rejection===
Besides conservation of names of certain ranks (Art.&amp;nbsp;14), the ICN also offers the option of outright rejection of a name ('''''nomen utique rejiciendum''''') also called '''suppressed name''' under Article&amp;nbsp;56, another way of creating a ''nomen rejiciendum''  that cannot be used anymore. Outright rejection is possible for a name at any rank.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Rejection (suppression) of individual names is distinct from suppression of works ('''''opera utique oppressa''''') under Article&amp;nbsp;34, which allows for listing certain taxonomic ranks in certain publications which are considered not to include any validly published names.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Effects ===
Conflicting conserved names are treated according to the normal rules of priority. Separate proposals (informally referred to as "superconservation" proposals) may be made to protect a conserved name that would be overtaken by another. However, conservation has different consequences depending on the type of name that is conserved:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
*A conserved family name is protected against all other family names based on genera that are considered by the taxonomist to be part of the same family.
*A conserved genus or species name is conserved against any [[homonym (biology)|homonym]]s, [[homotypic synonym]]s, and those ''specific'' heterotypic synonyms that are simultaneously declared nomina rejicienda (as well as their own homotypic synonyms).{{clarify|date=September 2013}} As taxonomic changes are made, other names may require new proposals for conservation and/or rejection.

===Documentation===
Conserved and rejected names (and suppressed names) are listed in the appendices to the ICN. As of the 2012 (Melbourne) edition, a separate volume holds the bulk of the appendices (except appendix I, on names of hybrids).&lt;ref name=appendices&gt;{{citation |authors=Wiersema, J.H.; McNeill, J.; Turland, N.J.; Barrie, F.R.; Buck, W.R.; Demoulin, V.; Greuter, W.; Hawksworth, D.L.; Herendeen, P.S.; Knapp, S.; Marhold, K.; Prado, J.; Prud'homme van Reine, W.F.; Smith, G.F. |year=2015 |volume=157 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 Appendices II - VIII |publisher=Koeltz Botanical Books |isbn=978-3-87429-480-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The substance of the second volume is generated from a database which also holds a history of published proposals and their outcomes, the binding decisions on whether a name is validly published (article 38.4) and on whether it is a homonym (article 53.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Wiersema, J.; McNeill, J.; Turland, N.J.; Orli, S.S.; Wagner, W.L. |year=2015 |title=The foundation of the Melbourne Code Appendices: Announcing a new paradigm for tracking nomenclatural decisions |journal=Taxon |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=1021–1027 |doi=10.12705/645.11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appendices/&gt; The database can be queried online.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://botany.si.edu/references/codes/props/ |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants: Appendices II-VIII (with an accounting of proposals to conserve and reject names, to suppress works, and requests for binding decisions) |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedure ===
# The procedure starts by submitting a proposal to the journal ''Taxon'' (published by the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy|IAPT]]). This proposal should present the case both for and against conservation of a name. Publication notifies anybody concerned that the matter is being considered and makes it possible for those interested to write in. Publication is the start of the formal procedure: it counts as referring the matter "to the appropriate Committee for study" and Rec&amp;nbsp;14A.1 comes into effect. The name in question is (somewhat) protected by this Recommendation ("... authors should follow existing usage as far as possible ...").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
# After reviewing the matter, judging the merits of the case, "the appropriate Committee" makes a decision either against ("not recommended") or in favor ("recommended"). Then the matter is passed to the General Committee.
# After reviewing the matter, mostly from a procedural angle, the General Committee makes a decision, either against ("not recommended") or in favor ("recommended"). At this point Article&amp;nbsp;14.16 comes into effect. Art 14.16 authorizes all users to indeed use that name.
# The General Committee reports to the Nomenclature Section of the [[International Botanical Congress]], stating which names (including types and spellings) it recommends for conservation. Then, by Div.III.1, the Nomenclature Section makes a decision on which names (including types, spellings) are accepted into the ''Code''. At this stage the ''de facto'' decision is made to modify the ''Code''.
# The Plenary Session of that same International Botanical Congress receives the "resolution moved by the Nomenclature Section of that Congress" and makes a ''de jure'' decision to modify the ''Code''. By long tradition this step is ceremonial in nature only.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the course of time there have been different standards for the majority required for a decision. However, for decades the Nomenclature Section has required a 60% majority for an inclusion in the ''Code'', and the Committees have followed this example, in 1996 adopting a 60% majority for a decision.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Zoology ==
For zoology, the term "conserved name", rather than ''nomen conservandum'', is used in the ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature'',&lt;ref name=ICZN/&gt; although informally both terms are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the glossary of the ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature''&lt;ref name=ICZN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |access-date=2006-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524144249/http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp |archive-date=2009-05-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the code for names of animals, one of several [[nomenclature codes]]), this definition is given:
;'''conserved name'''
:A name otherwise unavailable or invalid that the Commission, by the use of its plenary power, has enabled to be used as a [[Valid name (zoology)|valid name]] by removal of the known obstacles to such use.

This is a more generalized definition than the one for ''[[nomen protectum]]'', which is specifically a conserved name that is either a junior [[synonym (zoology)|synonym]] or [[homonym (zoology)|homonym]] that is in use because the senior synonym or homonym has been made a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'' ("forgotten name").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An example of a conserved name is the [[dinosaur]] genus name ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', which was formally described in 1943. Later, ''Tylosteus'' (which was formally described in 1872) was found to be the same genus as ''Pachycephalosaurus'' (a synonym). By the usual rules, the genus ''Tylosteus'' has precedence and would normally be the correct name. But the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) ruled that the name ''Pachycephalosaurus'' was to be given precedence and treated as the valid name, because it was in more common use and better known to scientists.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The ICZN's procedural details are different from those in botany, but the basic operating principle is the same, with petitions submitted to the commission for review.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

These kinds of interactions have been studied and modeled by population ecologists for nearly a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murdoch |first1=William W. |last2=Briggs |first2=Cheryl J. |last3=Nisbet |first3=Roger M. |title=Consumer-Resource Dynamics |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400847259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turchin |first1=Peter |title=Complex Population Dynamics: A Theoretical/Empirical Synthesis |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400847280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Species at the bottom of the food chain, such as [[algae]] and other [[autotrophs]], consume non-biological resources, such as [[minerals]] and [[nutrients]] of various kinds, and they derive their energy from light ([[photons]]) or chemical sources.  Species higher up in the food chain survive by consuming other species and can be classified by what they eat and how they obtain or find their food.

== Classification of consumer types ==

===The standard categorization===
Various terms have arisen to define consumers by what they eat, such as meat-eating [[carnivore]]s, fish-eating [[piscivore]]s, insect-eating [[insectivore]]s, plant-eating [[herbivore]]s, seed-eating [[granivores]], and fruit-eating [[frugivores]] and omnivores are meat eaters and plant eaters.  An extensive classification of consumer categories based on a list of [[feeding behaviors]] exists.{{Cn|date=February 2021}}

===The Getz categorization===
[[File:ConsumerWikiPDiag.svg|thumb|upright=&lt;!--for legibility--&gt;1.6|Wayne Getz's consumer categories are based on material eaten (plant: green live, brown dead; animal: red live, purple dead; or particulate: grey) and feeding strategy (gatherer: lighter shades; miner: darker shades).&lt;ref name=Getz2011/&gt;]]

Another way of categorizing consumers, proposed by South African American ecologist Wayne Getz, is based on a biomass transformation web (BTW) formulation that organizes resources into five components: live and dead animal, live and dead plant, and particulate (i.e. broken down plant and animal) matter.&lt;ref name=Getz2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Getz |first1=Wayne M. |title=Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer-resource modelling |journal=Ecology Letters |date=February 2011 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=113–124 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x|pmc=3032891 |pmid=21199247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also distinguishes between consumers that gather their resources by moving across landscapes from those that mine their resources by becoming [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] once they have located a stock of resources large enough for them to feed on during completion of a full life history stage.

In Getz's scheme, words for miners are of Greek etymology and words for gatherers are of Latin etymology. Thus a bestivore, such as a cat, preys on live animals (Latin: bestia=animal) while a sarcophage, such as a [[botfly]] larva mines live flesh and a zontanophage (Greek: zontanos=alive), such as a leaf miner, mines live plant material.  A carcasivore (Latin: carcasium=carcass), such as white-backed vulture, scavenge animal carcasses while a necrophage (Greek: nekros=dead body), such as a [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]], mines dead flesh. Victivores (Latin: victus=living) gather live plant material and thus include frugivores, nectivores, graminivores, granivores and folivores as subcategories.  Lectivores, such as many termites, gather dead plant material (Latin: lectus=bed which is the root of the word litter, as in leaf-litter) and thanatophages (Greek: thanatos=death), such as [[pillbugs]] mine piles of dead plant material. Carnivore and herbivore are generic multigroup categories for gathers respectively of animal and plant material, irrespective of whether live or dead. Croppers, scavengers, and detritivores are gatherers respectively of live, dead, and particulate material. Parasites, saprophages, and decomposers are miners respectively of live, dead, and particulate material.&lt;ref name=Getz2011/&gt;

      <text bytes="2368" xml:space="preserve">'''Contact''' is an annual interdisciplinary conference that brings together [http://www.contact-conference.com/archive/org.html renowned social and space scientists, science fiction writers and artists] to exchange ideas, stimulate new perspectives, and encourage serious, creative speculation about humanity's future. The intent of Contact is to promote the integration of [[Human factors and ergonomics|human factor]]s into space research and policy, to explore the intersection of science and art, and to develop ethical approaches to [[extraterrestrial intelligence|cross-cultural contact]]. Since its beginnings, the Contact conference has fostered interdisciplinary inquiries into art, literature, exploration and scientific investigation.

Contact was conceived by anthropologist Jim Funaro in 1979, and the first formal conference was held in 1983 in [[Santa Cruz, California]]. Twenty-six annual events have followed and several held at [[NASA Ames Research Center]]. In many previous years, the COTI HI project involved teams of high school students in the creation of scientifically accurate extraterrestrial beings, and in simulated encounters between two such races. 

Many spin-off organizations have formed, on line, and as far away as Japan. One such organization is the [[Contact consortium]], which is focused on the medium of contact in multi-user [[virtual world]]s on the [[Internet]].  

Contact has been closely allied with the [[SETI Institute]], and its early participants created the hypothetical planet Epona as covered in the Discovery Channel documentary [[Natural History of an Alien]].

The 27th  Contact conference was held on March 31 - April 2, 2012 at the [[SETI Institute]] and the Domain Hotel, in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. Beginning with the 28th conference, held in Mountain View, the organization adopted a biennial schedule. The 29th conference was held on April 1st-3rd, 2016, at the Domain Hotel, California.

      <text bytes="11248" xml:space="preserve">In the [[life sciences]], a '''contract research organization''' ('''CRO''') is a company that provides support to the  [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[biotechnology]], and [[medical device]] industries in the form of research services [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] on a contract basis.  A CRO may provide such services as biopharmaceutical development, [[biologic assay]] development, commercialization, [[clinical development]], [[clinical trials]] management, [[pharmacovigilance]], [[outcomes research]], and [[Real world evidence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Lucas |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/09/contract-research-organizations-key-partners-in-the-drug-development-journey/?sh=12ac5f057a58 |title=Contract Research Organizations: Key Partners In The Drug Development Journey |work=Forbes.com |date=2021-04-09 |accessdate=2022-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CROs are designed to reduce costs for companies developing new medicines and drugs in [[niche market]]s. They aim to simplify [[market entry strategy|entry into drug markets]], and simplify development, as the need for large pharmaceutical companies to do everything ‘in house’ is now redundant. CROs also support foundations, research institutions, and universities, in addition to governmental organizations (such as the [[NIH]], [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100311082536/http://www.acrohealth.org/cro-market.php "The CRO Market"], Association of Clinical Research Organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many CROs specifically provide clinical-study and clinical-trial support for drugs and/or medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrohealth.org/cro-market1.html "The CRO Market"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015342/http://www.acrohealth.org/cro-market1.html |date=2013-07-03 }}, Association of Clinical Research Organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.activa-cro.com/|title=Contract Research Organization|website=Activa CRO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Clinical trial#Economics|sponsor of the trial]] retains responsibility for the quality of the CRO's work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last1=Sather |first1=Sandra |last2=Lawyer |first2=Jennifer |date=30 June 2022 |title=CRO Oversight Essentials |url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/cro-oversight-essentials-0002 |magazine=Clinical Leader |type=Guest column |location=Pennsylvania, United States |publisher=VertMarkets |access-date=30 July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CROs range from large, international full-service organizations to small, niche specialty groups. CROs that specialize in clinical-trials services can offer their clients the expertise of moving a new drug or device from its conception to [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]/[[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] marketing approval,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contract Research Organizations (CRO)|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli|url=http://www.cell-transfection.com/transfection-cro-services/|date=2017|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; without the drug sponsor having to maintain a staff for these services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotechmedia.com/definitions-c.html "Bio-Definitions"], Biotech Media. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101162837/http://www.biotechmedia.com/definitions-c.html |date=2009-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations who have had success in working with a particular CRO in a particular context (e.g. therapeutic area) might be tempted or encouraged to expand their engagement with that CRO into other, unrelated areas; however, caution is required as CROs are always seeking to expand their experience and success in one area cannot reliably predict success in unrelated areas that might be new to the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Definition, regulatory aspects==
The [[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]], a 2015 Swiss NGO of pharmaceutical companies and others, defined a contract research organization (CRO), specifically pertaining to [[clinical trial]]s services as:&lt;ref name=ICH&gt;[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R2__Step_4_2016_1109.pdf  E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice] International Council on Harmonisation good clinical practice, 66 ppp, amended Nov 2016, accessed 30 Jan 2018&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} "A person or an organization (commercial, academic, or other) contracted by the sponsor to perform one or more of a sponsor's trial-related duties and functions."

It further details the sponsor's responsibilities in its [[good clinical practice]] guidelines:&lt;ref name=ICH/&gt;{{rp|22–23}} 
*(5.2.1) A sponsor may transfer any or all of the sponsor's trial-related duties and functions to a CRO, but the ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity of the trial data always resides with the sponsor. The CRO should implement [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]].
*(5.2.2) Any trial-related duty and function that is transferred to and assumed by a CRO should be specified in writing. The sponsor should ensure oversight of any trial-related duties and functions carried out on its behalf, including trial-related duties and functions that are subcontracted to another party by the sponsor's contracted CRO(s).
*(5.2.3) Any trial-related duties and functions not specifically transferred to and assumed by a CRO are retained by the sponsor.
*(5.2.4) All references to a sponsor in this guideline also apply to a CRO to the extent that a CRO has assumed the trial-related duties and functions of a sponsor.
Guidance from the [[US FDA]] published in 2013 also speaks to the responsibility of the sponsor to oversee work of the CRO, including the circumstance where [[Regulatory risk differentiation|risk-based monitoring]] has been delegated to the CRO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  2021 saw a major update to US FDA regulations related to providing the agency with information about CROs and how they "comply with FDA regulations".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Market size and growth==
{{As of| 2013}}, there were over 1,100 CROs in the world, despite continued trends toward consolidation. Many CROs have been acquired while others have gone out of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Clinical-Development/CRO-Industry-Could-See-More-Consolidation-Experts-Say "CRO Industry Could See More Consolidation, Experts Say"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926203837/http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Clinical-Development/CRO-Industry-Could-See-More-Consolidation-Experts-Say |date=2013-09-26 }} outsourcing-pharma.com, 2013-06-20 Retrieved 2013-09-24&lt;/ref&gt; The industry is fragmented, with the top 10 companies controlling 56% of the market in 2008&lt;ref name=bioportfolio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100205075135/http://www.bioportfolio.com/cgi-bin/acatalog/The-Top-10-Contract-Research-Organizations-Positioning_-performance-and-SWOT-analyses.html The Top 10 Contract Research Organizations -Positioning, performance and SWOT analyses] bioportfolio.com, 5 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 55% in 2009.&lt;ref name="businsights2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbusinessinsights.com/content/rbcr0015m.pdf |access-date=February 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218005619/http://globalbusinessinsights.com/content/rbcr0015m.pdf |archive-date=December 18, 2010 |title=The CRO Market Outlook!publisher =globalbusinessinsights.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 global CRO market stood at $38,396.4 mln. and is projected to reach $90,926.3 mln. by the end of 2026, exhibiting a CAGR of 11.4% in the forecast period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Larger body size is associated with increased [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] for a number of reasons, although there are also some disadvantages both on an individual and on a clade level: clades comprising larger individuals are more prone to [[extinction]], which may act to limit the maximum size of [[organisms]].

==Function==

===Effects of growth===
[[Directional selection]] appears to act on organisms' size, whereas it exhibits a far smaller effect on other morphological traits,&lt;ref name=Kingsolver2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kingsolver| first1=J. G. | last2=Pfennig | first2=D. W.| title=Individual-level selection as a cause of Cope's rule of phyletic size increase | journal=Evolution| volume=58| issue=7| pages=1608–1612| date=July 2004| pmid=15341162| doi=10.1554/04-003| s2cid=198159428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible that this perception may be a result of sample bias.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; This selectional pressure can be explained by a number of advantages, both in terms of mating success and survival rate.&lt;ref name=Kingsolver2008/&gt;

For example, larger organisms find it easier to avoid or fight off predators and capture prey, to reproduce, to kill competitors, to survive temporary lean times, and to resist rapid climatic changes.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; They may also potentially benefit from better thermal efficiency, increased intelligence, and a longer lifespan.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt;

Offsetting these advantages, larger organisms require more food and water, and shift from [[r/K selection|r to K-selection]]. Their longer [[generation time]] means a longer period of reliance on the mother, and on a macroevolutionary scale restricts the clade's ability to evolve rapidly in response to changing environments.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt;

===Capping growth===
Left unfettered, the trend of ever-larger size would produce organisms of gargantuan proportions. Therefore, some factors must limit this process.
At one level, it is possible that the clade's increased vulnerability to extinction, as its members become larger, means that no taxon survives long enough for individuals to reach huge sizes.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; There are probably also physically imposed limits to the size of some organisms; for instance, insects must be small enough for oxygen to diffuse to all parts of their bodies, flying birds must be light enough to fly, and the length of giraffes' necks may be limited by the blood pressure it is possible for their hearts to generate.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; Finally, there may be a competitive element, in that changes in size are necessarily accompanied by changes in ecological niche. For example, terrestrial carnivores over 21&amp;nbsp;kg almost always prey on organisms larger, not smaller, than themselves.&lt;ref name="Van Valkenburgh2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1126/science.1102417| title=Cope's Rule, Hypercarnivory, and Extinction in North American Canids| year=2004| author=Van Valkenburgh, B.| journal=Science| volume=306| pages=101–4| pmid=15459388| last2=Wang| first2=X| last3=Damuth| first3=J| s2cid=12017658| issue=5693| bibcode=2004Sci...306..101V}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a niche is already occupied, competitive pressure may oppose the directional selection.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; The three [[Canidae]] clades ([[Hesperocyoninae]], [[Borophaginae]], and [[Caninae]]) all show a trend towards larger size, although the first two are now extinct.&lt;ref name=Paleobiol2008&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1666/07030.1|title=Testing hypotheses of the evolution of encephalization in the Canidae (Carnivora, Mammalia)|year=2008|author=Finarelli, John A.|journal=Paleobiology|volume=34|pages=35–45|s2cid=86060945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity==
Cope recognised that clades of Cenozoic mammals appeared to originate as small individuals, and that body mass increased through a clade's history.&lt;ref name=Alroy1998/&gt; Discussing the case of [[canid]] evolution in [[North America]], [[Blaire Van Valkenburgh]] of [[UCLA]] and coworkers state:
{{quotation| Cope's rule, or the evolutionary trend toward larger body size, is common among mammals. Large size enhances the ability to avoid predators and capture prey, enhances reproductive success, and improves thermal efficiency. Moreover, in large carnivores, interspecific competition for food tends to be relatively intense, and bigger species tend to dominate and kill smaller competitors. Progenitors of hypercarnivorous lineages may have started as relatively small-bodied scavengers of large carcasses, similar to foxes and coyotes, with selection favoring both larger size and enhanced craniodental adaptations for meat eating. Moreover, the evolution of predator size is likely to be influenced by changes in prey size, and a significant trend toward larger size has been documented for large North American mammals, including both herbivores and carnivores, in the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name="Van Valkenburgh2004"/&gt;}}

In some cases, the increase in body size may represent a passive, rather than an active, trend.&lt;ref name=Carrano2006&gt;{{cite book | author=Carrano, M.T. | year=2006
 | title=Body-Size Evolution in the Dinosauria | journal=Amniote Paleobiology: Perspectives on the Evolution of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles: A Volume Honoring James Allen Hopson | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uNMCqSRQ9gC&amp;q=carrano&amp;pg=RA4-PA225 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-09478-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the maximum size increases, but the minimum size does not; this is usually a result of size varying pseudo-randomly rather than directed evolution. This does not fall into Cope's rule ''[[Sensu|sensu stricto]]'', but is considered by many workers to be an example of "Cope's rule ''[[Sensu|sensu lato]]''".&lt;ref name=Jablonski1997/&gt; In other cases, an increase in size may in fact represent a transition to an optimal body size, and not imply that populations always develop to a larger size.&lt;ref name=Alroy1998&gt;{{cite journal| first1=J. | title=Cope's Rule and the Dynamics of Body Mass Evolution in North American Fossil Mammals | journal=Science | volume=280 | issue=5364 | pages=731–734 | year=1998| pmid=9563948| last1=Alroy|doi=10.1126/science.280.5364.731|bibcode=1998Sci...280..731A | url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/20309/files/PAL_E4068.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many [[palaeobiologist]]s are skeptical of the validity of Cope's rule, which may merely represent a statistical artefact.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould1996"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Stephen Jay |last=Gould | year=1997 | title=Cope's rule as psychological artefact | journal=Nature | volume=385 | pages=199–200 |doi=10.1038/385199a0 | issue=6613|bibcode=1997Natur.385..199G |s2cid=205026571 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purported examples of Cope's rule often assume that the stratigraphic age of fossils is proportional to their "clade rank", a measure of how derived they are from an ancestral state; this relationship is in fact quite weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sereno|first1=P. C. | author2=A. L. Beck | author3=D. B. Dutheil | author4=B. Gado | author5=H. C. E. Larsson | author6=G. H. Lyon | author7=J. D. Marcot | author8=O. W. M. Rauhut | author9=R. W.

For example, among genera of Cretaceous molluscs, an increase in size is no more common than stasis or a decrease.&lt;ref name=Jablonski1997&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Jablonski | first1=D. | title=Body-size evolution in Cretaceous molluscs and the status of Cope's rule | journal=Nature | volume=385 | pages=250–252 | year=1997 | doi=10.1038/385250a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.385..250J | issue=6613| s2cid=4322252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, Cope's rule only operates at certain taxonomic levels (for example, an order may obey Cope's rule, while its constituent families do not), or more generally, it may apply to only some clades of a taxon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Laurin | first1=M | year=2004 | title=The evolution of body size, Cope's rule and the origin of amniotes | journal=Systematic Biology | volume=53 | issue=4| pages=594–622 | doi=10.1080/10635150490445706 | pmid=15371249| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite many counter-examples, Cope's rule is supported in many instances. For example, all marine invertebrate phyla except the molluscs show a size increase between the Cambrian and Permian.&lt;ref name="Novack-Gottshall2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Novack-Gottshall |first=Philip M. | year=2008 | title=Ecosystem-wide body-size trends in Cambrian–Devonian marine invertebrate lineages | url= http://www.ben.edu/faculty/pnovack-gottshall/2008_Novack-Gottshall_Paleobiology.pdf | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2008)034[0210:EBTICM]2.0.CO;2 | journal=Paleobiology | volume=34 | pages=210–228 | issn=0094-8373 | issue=2|s2cid=21388114 | access-date= 12 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, [[dinosaurs]] exhibit an increase in body length over their evolution.&lt;ref name="HoneKeesey2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hone |first1= D. W. E. |last2=Keesey |first2= T. M. |last3=Pisani |first3= D. |last4=Purvis |first4= A. |title=Macroevolutionary trends in the Dinosauria: Cope's rule |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=18 |issue=3 |date=2005 |pages=587–595 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00870.x |pmid=15842488|s2cid= 14122343 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cope's rule also appears to hold in clades where a constraint on size is expected. For instance, one may expect the size of birds to be constrained, as larger masses mean more energy must be expended in flight. Birds have been suggested to follow Cope's law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last2=Dyke | pages=618–624| issue=2| volume=21| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| date=Mar 2008 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01483.x| last1=Hone| pmid=18194232| issn=1010-061X | first3=M. | first2=J. | first4=J. | last4=Benton| last3=Haden| title=Body size evolution in Mesozoic birds| first1=W.| s2cid=8065382| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a subsequent reanalysis of the same data suggested otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Butler | first1=R. J. | last2=Goswami | first2=A. | year=2008 | title=Body size evolution in Mesozoic birds: little evidence for Cope's rule | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=21 | issue=6| pages=1673–1682 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01594.x | pmid=18691237| s2cid=21162784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive study published in 2015 supports the presence of a trend toward larger body size in marine animals during the [[Phanerozoic]]. However, this trend was present mainly in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]]; the [[Mesozoic]] was a period of relative stasis. The trend is not attributable simply to neutral drift in body size from small ancestors, and was mainly driven by a greater rate of diversification in classes of larger mean size. A smaller component of the overall trend is due to trends of increasing size within individual families.&lt;ref name="Helm2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Heim | first1=N. A. | last2=Knope | first2=M.

The '''Copley Medal''' is an award given by the [[Royal Society]], for "outstanding achievements in research in any branch of science". It alternates between the physical sciences or mathematics and the biological sciences.&lt;ref name="cop1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1736|title=The Copley Medal (1731)|website=royalsociety.org|publisher=The Royal Society|access-date=5 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215224953/https://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1736|archive-date=15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given every year, the medal is the oldest Royal Society medal awarded and the oldest surviving scientific award in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/copley-medal/|title=Copley Medal|website=royalsociety.org|publisher=The Royal Society|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; having first been given in 1731 to [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], for "his new Electrical Experiments: – as an encouragement to him for the readiness he has always shown in obliging the Society with his discoveries and improvements in this part of Natural Knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1744|title=Copley archive winners 1799–1731|website=royalsociety.org|publisher=The Royal Society|access-date=5 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111085614/http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1744|archive-date=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== History ==

The medal was created following a donation of [[Pound sterling|£]]100 to be used for carrying out experiments by [[Sir Godfrey Copley, 2nd Baronet|Sir Godfrey Copley]], for which the interest on the amount was used for several years.&lt;ref name="cop2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Societies/CopleyMedal.html|title=Copley Medal|publisher=[[University of St Andrews]]|access-date=2009-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505120009/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Societies/CopleyMedal.html|archive-date=2013-05-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions for the medal have been changed several times; in 1736, it was suggested that "a medal or other honorary prize should be bestowed on the person whose experiment should be best approved", and this remained the rule until 1831, when the conditions were changed so that the medal would be awarded to the researcher that the Royal Society Council decided most deserved it.&lt;ref name="cop2"/&gt; A second donation of £1666 13[[Shilling (British coin)|s]]. 4[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]. (400,000 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|old pence]]) was made by Sir Joseph William Copley in 1881, and the interest from that amount is used to pay for the medal.&lt;ref name="cop2"/&gt; The medal in its current format is made of [[silver-gilt]] and awarded with a £25,000 prize.&lt;ref name="cop1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.royalsociety.org/inside-science/2016/05/18/copley-winners-that-changed-the-world/|title=Copley winners that changed the world|website=blogs.royalsociety.org|publisher=The Royal Society|access-date=26 May 2020|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, it has been awarded to many distinguished scientists, including 52 winners of the Nobel Prize: 17 in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], 21 in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]], and 14 in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]].
[[John Theophilus Desaguliers]] has won the medal the most often, winning three times, in 1734, 1736 and 1741. In 1976, [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] became the first female recipient; [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], in 2021, is the second.

      <text bytes="2764" xml:space="preserve">'''Copurification''' in a [[chemistry|chemical]] or [[biochemistry|biochemical]] context is the physical [[separation process|separation]] by [[chromatography]] or other [[list of purification methods in chemistry|purification technique]] of two or more substances of interest from other [[contamination|contaminating]] substances. For substances to co-purify usually implies that these substances attract each other to form a [[noncovalent bonding|non-covalent]] [[complex (chemistry)|complex]] such as in a [[protein complex]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-628-1"&gt;{{cite book | author = Golemis, Erica | title = Protein–protein interactions: a molecular cloning manual | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location = Plainview, N.Y | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-87969-628-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when [[fractionation|fractionating]] mixtures, especially mixtures containing large numbers of components (for example a [[Lysis#Cytolysis|cell lysate]]), it is possible by chance that some components may copurify even though they don't form complexes. In this context the term copurification is sometimes used to denote when two biochemical activities or some other property are isolated together after purification but it is not certain if the sample has been purified to homogeneity (i.e., contains only one molecular species or one molecular complex). Hence these activities or properties are likely but not guaranteed to reside on the same molecule or in the same molecular complex.

== Applications ==

      <text bytes="11611" xml:space="preserve">The '''coral of life''' is a metaphor or a mathematical model useful to illustrate evolution of life or phylogeny at various levels of resolution, including individual organisms, populations, species and large taxonomic groups. Its use in biology resolves several practical and conceptual difficulties that are associated with the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].

==History of the concept==
[[File:DarwinsCoral.jpg|thumb|Darwin's coral diagrams from his Notebook B]] In biological context, the 'coral of life' as a metaphor is almost as old as the 'tree of life'. After returning from his voyage around the world, Darwin suggested in his notebooks that:

{{Quote | text = The tree of life should perhaps be called the coral of life, base of branches dead; so that passages cannot be seen | author=Charles Darwin &lt;ref name = "notebook"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Darwin | first1 = Charles | title = Notebook B. | date = 1837 | page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

with obvious reference to branching corals whose dead colonies may form very thick deposits in the ocean (''representing past life'') with live animals occurring only on the top (''recent life''). This comment was illustrated by two simple diagrams, the first coral metaphors of evolution ever drawn in the history of biology. However, Darwin later abandoned his idea, and in the ''[[Origin of Species]]''&lt;ref name = origin&gt;{{cite book  | last = Darwin | first = Charles | year = 1872 | title = The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | url = https://archive.org/details/NHM_UK_L_263066 | location = London | publisher = John Murray | isbn = 978-1-4353-9386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he referred to the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] as the most appropriate means to summarize affinities of living organisms, thanks most likely to obvious connotations of this metaphor with religion, ancient and folk art and mythology.
  
Darwin’s early musing was rediscovered by several authors more than a century later,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = DeBeer, G | year = 1960 | title = Darwin's notebooks on transmutation of species | journal = Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History), Historical Series | volume = 2 | issue = 4731 | pages = 23–73 | bibcode = 1960Natur.187S..26. | doi = 10.1038/187026c0 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, D.

Peter | last2 = Townsend | first2 = Jeffrey P.| year = 2005 | title = Horizontal gene transfer, genome innovation and evolution | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 679–687 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1204| pmid = 16138096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and corals were raised to the level of mathematically defined objects even more recently.&lt;ref name="BSD"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Podani | first = János | year = 2017 | title = Different from trees, more than metaphors: branching silhouettes – corals, cacti, and the oaks| journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 737–753 | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syx039 | pmid = 28334310 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:CoralMath.png|right|360px]]
The picture to the right explains the different parts of a coral. Vertical axis is time, horizontal axis may be richness, morphological diversity, some other population measure or even scaled arbitrarily. Each point x in the diagram corresponds to an individual, a population or a taxon. At point of time h, there is an equivalence partition of points into classes C. A class Cg1 is the ancestor of the entire branch above it, Cr1 is the closest common ancestor class of two segments. A segment S is defined by two classes such that there is no branching between them. On top in the middle is visualized a horizontal event, such as hybridization between members of different classes, leading to a new segment and thus to a fan coral.&lt;ref name="BSD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Podani | first = János | year = 2019 | title = The coral of life | journal = Evolutionary Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–144 | doi = 10.1007/s11692-019-09474-w | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of corals as metaphors of phylogeny==
Botanical trees and (many) corals share only one fundamental property, namely branching, which makes both of them suitable to illustrate evolutionary divergence. Regarding other features, corals are superior to trees as metaphors of phylogeny because:&lt;ref name="BSD" /&gt;

* Only the uppermost sections of a coral are alive, whereas all parts of a tree, from its thinnest roots to the uppermost leaves, are living;
* The coral starts its development from a small initial colony, grows upwards and ramifies later, while a tree grows from seed into two opposite directions, producing roots and the crown which may be equally large and similarly complex in shape; 
* The diameter of a tree continuously decreases from the trunk to the twigs, a property without phylogenetic implications, while corals may be even wider above than below, better symbolizing temporal change of taxonomic richness or population size;
* Normally, tree branches never fuse whereas coral branches may exhibit [[anastomosis|anastomoses]], thereby representing horizontal evolutionary events.

==Advantages of corals as mathematical models of phylogeny==
[[File:TreeToCoral.png|right|thumb|Zooming out from a network/tree of individuals to a coral diagram in 4 steps. See further examples in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Maddison | first1 = Wayne P. | last2 = Maddison | first2 = David R.| year = 1992 | title = MacClade.

Trees as graph theoretical constructs are composed of vertices (nodes) representing biological entities and connecting edges (links) corresponding to relations between entities. Being a special case of branching silhouette diagrams, corals may also be defined mathematically; these are geometric shapes embedded into a two- or three-dimensional space with time as one axis and some other meaningful property, such as taxon richness, as the other (one or two). Regarding their applicability to represent phylogenies, corals and trees compare in the following way:
* Trees are tools of discrete mathematics, and are therefore inappropriate to demonstrate evolutionary continuum, whereas corals as geometric shapes may very well serve this purpose; 
* Trees, by definition, cannot have cycles and – contrary to networks – are thus inappropriate to reflect horizontal events, such as hybridization or endosymbiosis, while fan corals allow links between branches;   
* Trees are computationally feasible, and remain fundamental tools in revealing phylogenetic relationships; corals can be constructed by hand based on trees and additional information from various sources in systematics, paleontology, geology etc. 
* There is considerable freedom in the graphical visualization of both trees and corals, although the latter may involve more artistic and heuristic elements.

When nodes of trees and networks represent individuals, so that the graphs demonstrate parent-offspring relations for asexual and sexual populations, respectively, one may zoom out so that the minor details (nodes and edges) of the diagram disappear and the discrete graph is smoothed into a coral – which is often called a “tree”, unfortunately.

While corals may be drawn for any particular taxonomic group, e.g., “coral of plants,” the term “coral of life” specifically refers to all cellular life, viruses excluded. 

The figure on the right is a first attempt to display a coral of life.&lt;ref name="CL" /&gt;

==The coral and the classification of life==
The last, but not the least important, feature of the coral of life is that it requires a classification valid for the past and present life viewed together. To see how it is possible, we may refer again to Darwin, who warned that the system of Linnaean ranks works only thanks to our insufficient knowledge of the past life. It is due to the absence of extinct forms

{{Quote | text = and to the consequent wide gaps in the series, that we are enabled to divide the existing species into definable groups, such as genera, families, and tribes | author = Charles Darwin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Darwin | first1 = Charles | title = On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing | date = 1862 | publisher = John Murray | location = London | pages = 330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Earlier, in the ''[[Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name = origin /&gt; he commented that groups that are clearly separable at present, based on many characters, have much fewer differences for their ancient members, which are therefore closer to each other in the past than are their descendants in the present. That is, gaps observed between recent taxa [[Taxonomic boundary paradox|paradoxically]] disappear when we go back to the ancestors – questioning the meaningfulness of Linnaean ranks . Consistently with this, Darwin suggested further  that the natural classification system

{{Quote |text= must be, as far as possible, genealogical in arrangement, – that is, the co-descendants of the same form must be kept together in one group, apart from the co-descendants of any other form; but if the parent-forms are related, so will be their descendants, and the two groups together will form a larger group… |author = Charles Darwin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Darwin | first = Charles | title = The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex | url = https://archive.org/details/descentmanandse03darwgoog | date = 1871 | publisher = John Murray | location = London | page=[https://archive.org/details/descentmanandse03darwgoog/page/n132 118] | edition = First }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:CoralClass.jpg|thumb|Definition of taxa based on a coral. The red branch is monophyletic, just like the brown and red branches together. The dark and pale green segments exemplify a budding event which may only be possible at the species level.]] The system can be made genealogical if we abandon the rank system  and consider coral branches as taxa, analogously to clades derived from tree representations of phylogeny. That is, every branch of the coral is a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group whose members are derived from the same equivalence class such that no other branches arise from that class.

'''Corneometry''' is a widely practiced method for the measurement of skin [[Tissue hydration|hydration]]. It uses a [[capacitive]] sensor to measure the [[relative permittivity]] of [[epidermis|upper skin layers]]. Because these depend on hydration of skin, the measured value is a measure for skin hydration.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Blichmann, J. Serup: ''Assessment of Skin Moisture'', Acta Derm. Venereol. (Stockli) 1988; 68: 284–290&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''corneometry'' is derived from the German trademark ''Corneometer''.&lt;ref&gt;''Corneometer'': Entry in the German trademark register [https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/1007781/DE no. 1007781]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the first commercial instrument for measuring skin hydration was sold under this name.

'''Corneous''' is a biological and [[medical term]] meaning '''horny''', in other words made out of a substance similar to that of [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s and [[hooves]] in some [[mammal]]s. 

The word is generally used to describe natural or pathological anatomical structures made out of a hard layer of [[protein]]. In mammals this protein would usually be [[keratin]].

The word corneous is also often used to describe the [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] of a [[snail]], a [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]. Not all gastropods have opercula, but in the great majority of those that do have one, the operculum is corneous. (However in several genera within a few families including the marine [[Naticidae]] and the terrestrial [[Pomatiidae]], the operculum is primarily [[calcareous]], in other words mostly made of [[calcium carbonate]].) Corneous opercula are made out of the protein [[conchiolin]].

The '''CoRR hypothesis''' states that the location of [[genetic information]] in [[cytoplasmic]] [[organelles]] permits regulation of its expression by the reduction-oxidation ("[[redox]]") state of its [[gene product]]s.

CoRR is short for "co-location for redox regulation", itself a shortened form of "co-location (of gene and gene product) for (evolutionary) continuity of redox regulation of [[gene expression]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allen JF | title = Why chloroplasts and mitochondria retain their own genomes and genetic systems: colocation for redox regulation of gene expression | journal = Proc.

==The problem==
===Chloroplasts and mitochondria===
[[Chloroplasts]] and [[mitochondria]] are energy-converting organelles in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[eukaryotic cells]].  Chloroplasts in [[plant cells]] perform [[photosynthesis]]; the capture and conversion of the energy of [[sunlight]].  Mitochondria in both plant and [[animal cells]] perform [[cellular respiration|respiration]]; the release of this stored energy when work is done.  In addition to these key reactions of [[bioenergetics]], chloroplasts and mitochondria each contain specialized and discrete genetic systems.  These genetic systems enable chloroplasts and mitochondria to make some of their own [[proteins]].

Both the genetic and energy-converting systems of chloroplasts and mitochondria are descended, with little modification, from those of the free-living bacteria that these organelles once were.  The existence of these cytoplasmic [[genomes]] is consistent with, and counts as evidence for, the [[endosymbiont hypothesis]].  Most genes for proteins of chloroplasts and mitochondria are, however, now located on [[chromosomes]] in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells.  There they code for protein precursors that are made in the [[cytosol]] for subsequent import into the organelles.

===Why do mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own genetic systems?===
{{quote|text=Why do mitochondria and chloroplasts require their own separate genetic systems, when other organelles that share the same cytoplasm, such as peroxisomes and lysosomes, do not? The question is not trivial, because maintaining a separate genetic system is costly: more than 90 proteins ... must be encoded by nuclear genes specifically for this purpose. ... The reason for such a costly arrangement is not clear, and the hope that the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes would provide the answer has proved to be unfounded. We cannot think of compelling reasons why the proteins made in mitochondria and chloroplasts should be made there rather than in the cytosol.|sign= Alberts et al. |source= ''The Molecular Biology of the Cell''.

===Cytoplasmic inheritance===
CoRR seeks to explain why chloroplasts and mitochondria retain [[DNA]], and thus why some characters are inherited through the cytoplasm in the phenomenon of cytoplasmic, non-[[Mendelian]], uniparental, or [[maternal inheritance]].  CoRR does so by offering an answer to this question: why, in [[evolution]], did some bacterial, [[endosymbiont]] genes move to the [[cell nucleus]], while others did not?

==Proposed solution==
CoRR states that chloroplasts and mitochondria contain those [[genes]] whose expression is required to be under the direct, regulatory control of the redox state of their gene products, or of [[electron]] carriers with which those gene products interact.  Such genes comprise a core, or primary subset, of organellar genes.  The requirement for redox control of each gene in the primary subset then confers an advantage upon location of that gene within the organelle.  [[Natural selection]] therefore anchors some genes in organelles, while favouring location of others in the cell nucleus.

Chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes also contain genes for components of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genetic systems themselves.  These genes comprise a secondary subset of organellar genes: genetic system genes.  There is generally no requirement for redox control of expression of genetic system genes, though their being subject to redox control may, in some cases, allow [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]] of redox signals acting upon genes in the primary subset (bioenergetic genes).

Retention of genes of the secondary subset (genetic system genes) is necessary for the operation of redox control of expression of genes in the primary subset.  If all genes disappear from the primary subset, CoRR predicts that there is no function for genes in the secondary subset, and such organelles will then, eventually, lose their genomes completely.  However, if even only one gene remains under redox control, then an organelle genetic system is required for the synthesis of its gene product.

'''CosmicOS''' is a self-contained message designed to be understood primarily by treating it as a [[computer program]] and executing it.  It is inspired by [[Hans Freudenthal]]'s [[Lincos (language)|Lincos]] and resembles the programming language [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] in many ways.

The message is written with only four basic symbols representing the binary digits one and zero and open and close brackets. Numbers are represented as a string of binary digits between a pair of brackets and expressions are represented as a string of numbers between brackets. Identifiers for operations are arbitrarily assigned numbers and their functions can be defined within the message itself.

Self-contained messages are of interest for [[Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence|CETI]] research, but there is much difference of opinion over the most appropriate encoding and broadcast medium to use.

[[File:Cospeciation (5 processes) - with key.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Cospeciation and host-parasite associations. From top to bottom:
&lt;br&gt;'''Cospeciation:''' host and parasite speciate concurrently
&lt;br&gt;'''Host switching:''' speciation as parasite switches hosts and evolves in reproductive isolation
&lt;br&gt;'''Independent speciation:''' parasite speciates on same host, reasons unrelated to host
&lt;br&gt;'''Extinction:''' parasite goes extinct on host
&lt;br&gt;'''Missing the boat:''' host speciates but parasite does not end up reproductively isolated]]
'''Cospeciation''' is a form of [[coevolution]] in which the [[speciation]] of one species dictates speciation of another species and is most commonly studied in host-[[parasite]] relationships. In the case of a host-parasite relationship, if two hosts of the same species get within close proximity of each other, parasites of the same species from each host are able to move between individuals and mate with the parasites on the other host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_46 |title=Cospeciation |website=evolution.berkeley.edu |access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a speciation event occurs in the host species, the parasites will no longer be able to "cross over" because the two new host species no longer mate and, if the speciation event is due to a geographic separation, it is very unlikely the two hosts will interact at all with each other. The lack of proximity between the hosts ultimately prevents the populations of parasites from interacting and mating. This can ultimately lead to speciation within the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://biologos.org/blogs/dennis-venema-letters-to-the-duchess/evolution-basics-parasitism-mutualism-and-cospeciation |title=Evolution Basics: Parasitism, Mutualism and Cospeciation |last=BioLogos |work=BioLogos |access-date=2017-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100145/http://biologos.org/blogs/dennis-venema-letters-to-the-duchess/evolution-basics-parasitism-mutualism-and-cospeciation |archive-date=2017-04-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to '''Fahrenholz's rule''', first proposed by Heinrich Fahrenholz in 1913, when host-parasite cospeciation has occurred, the phylogenies of the host and parasite come to mirror each other. In host-parasite phylogenies, and all species phylogenies for that matter, perfect mirroring is rare. Host-parasite phylogenies can be altered by host switching, extinction, independent speciation, and other ecological events, making cospeciation harder to detect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=eLS|last=Page|first=Roderic DM|date=2001-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780470015902 |doi=10.1038/npg.els.0004124|chapter = Cospeciation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cospeciation is not limited to parasitism, but has been documented in symbiotic relationships like those of gut microbes in primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Moeller|first1=Andrew H. |last2=Caro-Quintero |first2=Alejandro |last3=Mjungu |first3=Deus|last4=Georgiev|first4=Alexander V.|last5=Lonsdorf |first5=Elizabeth V. |last6=Muller |first6=Martin N. |last7=Pusey |first7=Anne E. |last8=Peeters |first8=Martine |last9=Hahn |first9=Beatrice H. |date=2016-07-22 |title=Cospeciation of gut microbiota with hominids |journal=Science|language=en |volume=353|issue=6297|pages=380–382|doi=10.1126/science.aaf3951 |pmc=4995445|pmid=27463672|bibcode=2016Sci...353..380M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fahrenholz's rule ==
In 1913, Heinrich Fahrenholz proposed that the phylogenies of both the host and parasite will eventually become congruent, or mirror each other when cospeciation occurs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More specifically, more closely related parasite species will be found on closely related species of host. Thus, to determine if cospeciation has occurred within a host-parasite relationship, scientists have used comparative analyses on the host and parasite phylogenies.

In 1968, [[Daniel H. Janzen|Daniel Janzen]] proposed an opposing theory to Fahrenholz's rule. Studying cospeciation within plant-insect relationships, he proposed that species have a physiological range of conditions and environments. Over time, conserved traits within a parasitic species allows for survival in a range of conditions or environments. "Ecological fitting", as it is known, means more closely related parasites will share similar traits that pertain to surviving on a particular host. This provides explanation for the congruence of the host-parasite phylogenies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/accessory/Cospeciation_of_Lice_and_Their_Hosts?acc_id=456 |title=Cospeciation of Lice and Their Hosts|website=tolweb.org |access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227606715 |title=The historical biogeography of co-evolution: Emerging infectious diseases are evolutionary accidents waiting to happen (PDF Download Available) |access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== False incongruence ==
The two main hurdles to determining cospeciation using Fahrenholz's rule are instances of false congruence and false incongruence. False congruence occurs when parasite and host phylogenies mirror each other but not due to cospeciation, for instance, if the parasites were to colonize the hosts after the host species had diverged and congruent phylogenies resulted by chance, but this is unlikely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; False incongruence, when cospeciation has occurred, but the phylogenies do not mirror each other, is more common, and can be caused by a number of factors; it might also appear to be present if parasites that are present on a host are not detected by the experimenter.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Host - Parasite Evolution: General Principles &amp; Avian Models |last1=Paterson |first1=Adrian |last2=Gray |first2=Russell |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |location=Oxford |pages=236–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Host switching ===
Though parasites have been thought to be specialized to a certain host species, it is common for a parasite to colonize a different host that was not previous colonized by the parasite species. If a "[[host switch]]" occurs after a cospeciation event, the presence of the parasite on other host species will disrupt any potential congruence in the two phylogenies. Coupled with extinction or independent speciation, phylogenetic comparisons can become complicated and entirely mask the cospeciation event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=de Vienne|first1=D. M.|last2=Refrégier|first2=G. |last3=López-Villavicencio |first3=M.|last4=Tellier |first4=A. |last5=Hood |first5=M. E. |last6=Giraud|first6=T.|date=2013-04-01|title=Cospeciation vs host-shift speciation: methods for testing, evidence from natural associations and relation to coevolution |journal=New Phytologist |volume=198 |issue=2 |pages=347–385 |doi=10.1111/nph.12150|pmid=23437795|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent speciation ===
Typically independent speciation does not significantly alter the phylogenetic analysis used to measure cospeciation. However, in combination with extinction, independent speciation can become very problematic when trying to sort out host and parasite phylogenies. Independent speciation occurs when a single population on a single host undergoes speciation resulting in two sister lineages of parasite on a particular host. In other words, the parasite lineage speciates while the host lineage does not. This becomes complicated when the two lineages of parasites then undergo cospeciation with the host. If one of the two parasite lineages goes extinct from the new host lineage, the phylogenies of the host and parasite will begin to break apart. Even though the parasite and host cospeciated together, the phylogenies will not be congruent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Extinction ===
After cospeciation, it is possible for a parasite (or symbiont) to become extinct while its host survives. This can happen if, for example, the host species adapts to a new habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== "Missing the boat" ===
Prior to speciation of the hosts, if the distribution of the parasite population among the host population is sporadic, it is possible that when host speciation occurs, it will occur with hosts that do not have the parasite population. This phenomenon is known as "missing the boat". The parasites could potentially cospeciate with their host down the line, however, the parasites could potentially be absent from some host lineages. Like extinction and independent speciation, "missing the boat" alone will probably have a minimal effect on mapping phylogenies, however, in conjunction with independent speciation, parasite and host phylogenies can begin to break apart.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various sources have theorized that SARS-CoV-2 could have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or another laboratory in Wuhan, such as the [[Wuhan Center For Disease Control &amp; Prevention]]. The theories vary on whether this was an intentional act or an accident. Theories also vary on whether the virus was modified by human activity prior to being released.

As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, lab leak theories became less rooted in science, adopting instead the trappings of conspiracy theory; by 2022 most lab leak proponents were promoting a narrative with conspiracist components, and such narratives were often underpinned by [[racism]]; [[David Gorski]] refers to "the blatant anti-Chinese racism and xenophobia behind lab leak".&lt;ref name=risefall/&gt;&lt;ref name=prox/&gt;

Some have theorized the virus arose in humans from an [[Laboratory-acquired infection|accidental infection of laboratory workers]] by contact with a sample extracted from a wild animal or by direct contact with a captive animal or its respiratory droplets or feces.&lt;ref name="FrutosMarch2021"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frutos|first1=Roger|last2=Gavotte|first2=Laurent|last3=Devaux|first3=Christian A.|date=March 2021|title=Understanding the origin of COVID-19 requires to change the paradigm on zoonotic emergence from the spillover to the circulation model|journal=[[Infection, Genetics and Evolution]]|volume=95|pages=104812|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104812 |pmc=7969828|pmid=33744401|quote=See i.a.

Former CDC director [[Robert R.

==== Furin cleavage site ====
Some claims of bioengineering focus on the presence of two sequential [[cytosine]]-[[guanine]]-guanine (CGG) [[codon]]s in the virus' [[RNA]], more precisely in the crucial [[furin]] cleavage site.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski" /&gt; The CGG codon is one of several codons that [[Translation (biology)|translates]] into an [[arginine]] [[amino acid]], and it is the least common arginine codon in human pathogenic betacoronaviruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=Haogao|last2=Chu|first2=Daniel K W|last3=Peiris|first3=Malik|last4=Poon|first4=Leo L M|date=14 May 2020|title=Multivariate analyses of codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses|journal=Virus Evolution|volume=6|issue=1|pages=veaa032|doi=10.1093/ve/veaa032|issn=2057-1577|pmc=7223271|pmid=32431949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially, this lack of CGG codons in human pathogenic coronaviruses is due to [[natural selection]]: [[B-cell]]s in the human body recognize areas on virus genomes where C and G are next to each other (so-called [[CpG sites|CpG islands]]).&lt;ref name="FrutosMarch2021" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KriegBCells"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krieg|first1=Arthur M.|last2=Yi|first2=Ae-Kyung|last3=Matson|first3=Sara|last4=Waldschmidt|first4=Thomas J.|last5=Bishop|first5=Gail A.|last6=Teasdale|first6=Rebecca|last7=Koretzky|first7=Gary A.|last8=Klinman|first8=Dennis M.|date=April 1995|title=CpG motifs in bacterial DNA trigger direct B-cell activation|journal=Nature|volume=374|issue=6522|pages=546–549|bibcode=1995Natur.374..546K|doi=10.1038/374546a0|pmid=7700380|s2cid=4261304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGG codon makes up 5% of the arginine codons in the SARS-CoV-1 genome, and it makes up 3% of the arginine codons in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt; Proponents of an engineered virus, including journalist [[Nicholas Wade]], claim that two such uncommon codons in a row are evidence for a laboratory experiment; because of the low chance of a CGG codon pair occurring in nature, and in contrast, the common usage of CGG codons for arginine in genetic engineering work.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski" /&gt; This has been disputed by scientists, who note that the CGG codon is also present (and even more frequent) in other coronaviruses, including [[MERS-CoV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hou|first1=Wei|date=December 2020|title=Characterization of codon usage pattern in SARS-CoV-2|journal=[[Virology Journal]]|volume=17|issue=1|pages=138|doi=10.1186/s12985-020-01395-x|pmc=7487440|pmid=32928234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a codon being rare does not mean it cannot be present. In addition, the presence of the furin cleavage site, which is responsible for a significant increase in transmissibility, largely outweighs the disadvantageous immune responses from B-cells triggered by the genetic sequences which code for it.&lt;ref name="KriegBCells" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FrutosMarch2021" /&gt;

Another source of speculation is the presence of the furin cleavage site itself. It is absent in the nearest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2, but scientists consider that this is likely the result of recombination, and is further unsurprising due to the genetic lineage of the virus being poorly sampled. A common occurrence amongst other coronaviruses, including [[MERS-CoV]], [[HCoV-OC43]], [[HCoV-HKU1]], and appearing in near-identical fashion in [[HKU9-1]], the site is preceded by short [[palindromic sequence]]s suggestive of natural recombination caused by simple evolutionary mechanisms. Additionally, the suboptimal configuration of the cleavage site when compared with known examples (such as HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-HKU1), along with the complex task this would have required, is inconsistent with what would be expected from an engineered virus.&lt;ref name=critical /&gt;

In September 2022, a panel assembled by ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a wide-ranging report on the pandemic, including commentary on the virus origin overseen by the group's chairman [[Jeffrey Sachs]]. This suggested that the virus may have originated from an American laboratory, a notion long-promoted by Sachs, including on the podcast of conspiracy theorist [[Robert F.

The origin of COVID-19 became a source of friction in [[China–United States relations]]. The lab leak theory was promulgated in early 2020 by United States politicians and media, particularly US president [[Donald Trump]], other prominent Republicans, and conservative media (such as [[Fox News]] pundit Tucker Carlson, and former ''[[Breitbart News]]'' publisher and White House chief strategist [[Steve Bannon]]).&lt;ref name="TheConvJune2021"&gt;{{cite web |last=Knight |first=Peter |title=COVID-19: Why lab-leak theory is back despite little new evidence |url=https://theconversation.com/covid-19-why-lab-leak-theory-is-back-despite-little-new-evidence-162215 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=21 June 2021 |access-date=18 July 2021 |archive-date=18 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210718135624/https://theconversation.com/covid-19-why-lab-leak-theory-is-back-despite-little-new-evidence-162215 |url-status=live |publication-place=Melbourne }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EbanVanityFair"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Eban|first=Katherine|date=3 June 2021|title=The Lab-Leak Theory: Inside the Fight to Uncover COVID-19's Origins|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/the-lab-leak-theory-inside-the-fight-to-uncover-covid-19s-origins|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210606201656/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/the-lab-leak-theory-inside-the-fight-to-uncover-covid-19s-origins|archive-date=6 June 2021|access-date=19 July 2021|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|author-link=Katherine Eban}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump had also referred to the virus as "kung flu",&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Chow|first=Denise|date=16 June 2021|title=The science around the lab leak theory hasn't changed.

According to [[Paul Thacker]] (writing for the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''), some scientists and reporters said that "objective consideration of COVID-19's origins went awry early in the pandemic, as researchers who were funded to study viruses with pandemic potential launched a campaign labelling the lab leak hypothesis as a 'conspiracy theory.'"&lt;ref name="BMJJuly2021" /&gt; In February 2020, a letter was published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' authored by 27 scientists and spearheaded by Peter Daszak which described some alternate origin ideas as conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thacker|first1=Paul D|date=1 October 2021|title=Covid-19: Lancet investigation into origin of pandemic shuts down over bias risk|journal=BMJ|volume=375|pages=n2414|doi=10.1136/bmj.n2414|pmid=34598923|s2cid=238241044}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filippa Lentzos]] said some scientists "closed ranks" as a result, fearing for their careers and grants.&lt;ref name="BMJJuly2021" /&gt; The letter was criticized by [[Jamie Metzl]] for "scientific propaganda and thuggery",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lonas|first=Lexi|date=9 June 2021|title=WHO adviser accuses COVID-19 lab-leak theory critics of 'thuggery'|url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/557625-who-adviser-accuses-critics-of-covid-lab-leak-theory-of-thuggery|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201358/https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/557625-who-adviser-accuses-critics-of-covid-lab-leak-theory-of-thuggery| archive-date=24 June 2021|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Katherine Eban]] as having had a "[[chilling effect]]" on scientific research and the scientific community by implying that scientists who "bring up the lab-leak theory ... are doing the work of conspiracy theorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Did COVID-19 Leak From A Lab?

=== Coverage in 2021 ===
In early 2021, the hypothesis returned to popular debate due to renewed media discussion.&lt;ref name="TheConvJune2021" /&gt; The renewed interest was prompted by two events. First, an article published in May by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill with COVID-19-like symptoms in November 2019. The report was based on off-the-record briefings with intelligence officials.&lt;ref name="TheConvJune2021" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EbanVanityFair" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hinshaw|first=Michael R.

After the publication of the WHO-convened report, politicians, talk show hosts, journalists, and some scientists advanced claims that SARS-CoV-2 may have come from the WIV.&lt;ref name="maxman27may" /&gt; DRASTIC also contributed to its promotion, particularly via [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ryan|first=Jackson|date=15 April 2021|title=How the coronavirus origin story is being rewritten by a guerrilla Twitter group|url=https://www.cnet.com/features/how-the-coronavirus-origin-story-is-being-rewritten-by-a-guerrilla-twitter-group/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616154637/https://www.cnet.com/features/how-the-coronavirus-origin-story-is-being-rewritten-by-a-guerrilla-twitter-group/|archive-date=16 June 2021|access-date=1 June 2021|website=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2021, a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]–''[[Politico]]'' survey indicated that 52 percent of Americans believed that COVID-19 originated from a lab leak, while 28 percent believed that COVID-19 originated from an infected animal in nature.&lt;ref name="PoliticoPoll"/&gt;

'''Cranial evolutionary allometry''' ('''CREA''') is a scientific theory regarding trends in the shape of mammalian [[skulls]] during the course of evolution in accordance with body size (i.e., [[allometry]]).  Specifically, the theory posits that there is a propensity among closely related mammalian groups for the skulls of the smaller species to be short and those of the larger species to be long.  This propensity appears to hold true for placental as well as non-placental mammals, and is highly robust.  Examples of groups which exhibit this characteristic include [[antelope]]s,  [[fruit bat]]s,  [[mongoose]]s,  [[squirrel]]s  and  [[kangaroo]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the cranial evolutionary allometric 'rule' in Galliformes|author=Marta Linde-Medina|date=September 2016|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|issue=29|pages=1873–1878|volume=9|pmc=5021629|pmid=27306761|doi=10.1111/jeb.12918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=96th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Mammalogists|url=https://www.mammalsociety.org/uploads/2016-ASM-Abstracts-2016.05.18.pdf|author=Andrea Cardini|date=2016|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardini, A., Polly, D., Dawson, R., Milne, N., 2015.

It is believed that the reason for this trend has to do with size-related constraints on the formation and development of the mammalian skull.  Facial length is one of the best known examples of [[heterochrony]].&lt;ref&gt;Cardini, A., Polly, P.D., 2013. Larger mammals have longer faces because of size-related constraints on skull form.

[[File:Gray194.png|thumb|right|[[Sagittal plane|Sagittal]] section of a human skull, showing the cranial vault]]

The '''cranial vault''' is the space in the [[skull]] within the [[neurocranium]], occupied by the [[brain]].

== Development ==
In humans, the cranial vault is imperfectly composed in newborns, to allow the large human head to pass through the [[birth canal]]. During birth, the various bones, connected only by [[cartilage]] and [[ligament]]s, will move relatively to each other. The open portion between the major bones of the upper part of the vault, called [[fontanelle]]s, normally remain soft up to two years after birth. 

As the fontanelles close, the vault loses some of its plasticity. The [[Suture (anatomy)|sutures]] between the bones remain until 30 to 40 years of age, allowing for growth of the brain. Cranial vault size is directly proportional to skull size and is developed early.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;Changes in vault dimensions must occur by early childhood because of the early development of the vault.&lt;/cite&gt;" [https://archive.today/20121216143224/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007970/ABSTRACT Secular change in craniofacial morphology]
"&lt;cite&gt;During the 125 years under consideration, cranial vaults have become markedly higher and somewhat narrower, with narrower faces. The changes in cranial [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] are probably in large part due to changes in growth at the cranial base due to improved environmental conditions. The changes are likely a combination of [[phenotypic]] plasticity and genetic changes over this period.&lt;/cite&gt;" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11451056&amp;dopt=Abstract Cranial change in Americans: 1850-1975.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and shape of the brain and the surrounding vault remain quite plastic as the brain grows in childhood. In several ancient societies, head shape was altered for [[aesthetic]] or [[religious]] reasons by binding cloth or boards tightly around the head during infancy. It is not known whether such [[artificial cranial deformation]] has an effect in brain power.

== Evolution ==
[[File:Skull corvus corone cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of [[carrion crow]], showing the enlarged vault found in birds.]]
The cranial vault is composed of the [[endocranium]] forming the basal parts, topped by the [[skull roof]] in [[tetrapod|land vertebrates]].&lt;ref name="Romer, A 1977"&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S. Parsons. 1977. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fishes]] no distinct cranial vault as such exists. Instead, the skull is composed of loosely jointed bones. The cranial vault as a distinct unit arose with the fusion of the [[skull roof]] and the [[endocranium]] on the early [[Labyrinthodonts]].&lt;ref name="Romer, A 1977"/&gt; In [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] the vault is rather small and inconspicuous, only forming proper vaults in [[mammals]] and [[birds]].

==Overview==
{{main|History of evolutionary thought|History of the creation–evolution controversy}}

While many [[Christian denominations]] do not raise theological objections to the modern evolutionary synthesis as an explanation for the present forms of life on planet Earth, various [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]], and [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] religious sects and political groups within [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] have objected vehemently to the study and teaching of biological evolution.&lt;ref name="Edis 2020"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_publi.htm |title=Beliefs of the U.S. public about evolution and creation |last=Robinson |first=Bruce A. |date=November 1995 |website=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |location=Kingston, Ontario |access-date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some adherents of these Christian and Islamic religious sects or political groups are passionately opposed to the [[Scientific consensus|consensus view]] of the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="Edis 2020"/&gt; [[Literal and figurative language|Literal]] interpretations of religious texts are the greatest cause of conflict with evolutionary and [[Cosmology|cosmological]] investigations and conclusions.&lt;ref name="Edis 2020"/&gt;

Internationally, biological evolution is taught in science courses with limited controversy, with the exception of a few areas of the [[United States]] and several [[Muslim-majority countries]], primarily [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Edis 2020"/&gt; In the United States, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has ruled the teaching of [[creationism]] as [[science]] in [[State school#United States|public schools]] to be unconstitutional, irrespective of how it may be purveyed in [[Theology|theological]] or [[Catechism|religious instruction]].

==By country==

===Australia===
Although creationist views are popular among [[religious education]] teachers and creationist teaching materials have been distributed by volunteers in some schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Minus |first=Jodie |date=June 25, 2010 |title=Creationism creeps into NSW schools |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/creationism-creeps-into-nsw-schools/story-e6frg6nf-1225884487850 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[News Corp Australia]] |access-date=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; many Australian [[scientist]]s take an aggressive stance supporting the right of teachers to teach the theory of evolution, unhindered by religious restrictions.

{{cquote| An essential element in the teaching of science is the encouragement of students and teachers to critically appraise the evidence for notions being taught as science. The Society states unequivocally that the dogmatic teaching of notions such as Creationism within a science curriculum stifles the development of critical thinking patterns in the developing mind and seriously compromises the best interests of objective public education. This could eventually hamper the advancement of science and technology as students take their places as leaders of future generations. |||[[Geological Society of Australia]]&lt;ref name="GSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsa.org.au/pdfdocuments/management/POL_intel%20design_2008.pdf |title=Intelligent Design Policy: Science Education and Creationism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 17, 2008 |website=Geological Society of Australia |publisher=[[Geological Society of Australia|Geological Society of Australia Incorporated]] |location=Sydney |access-date=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1580

On October 4, 2007, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) adopted its Resolution 1580 titled ''The dangers of creationism in education''. The resolution observed that "The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism closely linked to extreme right-wing political movements," and urged member states "firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general the presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion."&lt;ref name="PACE_2007-10-04"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&amp;lang=en |title=The dangers of creationism in education |date=October 4, 2007 |work=Committee on Culture, Science and Education |publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe |type=Resolution |id=Resolution 1580 |access-date=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Content
The resolution's aim is "to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science … the Parliamentary Assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies. If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights."&lt;ref name="dw-world.de"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Council of Europe: Keep Creationism Out of Science Classes |url=http://www.dw.de/council-of-europe-keep-creationism-out-of-science-classes/a-2809619 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |location=Berlin/Bonn, Germany |publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] |date=October 5, 2007 |access-date=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects that creationism in any form, including "intelligent design," can be considered scientific (Para. 4), but considers possible its inclusion in religion and cultural classes (Para. 16). The resolution concludes that teaching creationism in school as a scientific theory may threaten civil rights (Paras. 13 and 18). The resolution summarizes itself in Para. 19:&lt;ref name="PACE_2007-10-04" /&gt;
{{quotation|
The Parliamentary Assembly therefore urges the member states, and especially their education authorities to:
#defend and promote scientific knowledge;
#strengthen the teaching of the foundations of science, its history, its epistemology and its methods alongside the teaching of objective scientific knowledge;
#make science more comprehensible, more attractive and closer to the realities of the contemporary world;
#firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general the presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion;
#promote the teaching of evolution as a fundamental scientific theory in the school curricula.}}

;Coverage and reaction

&lt;!-- Before adopting the resolution, the report prepared by Lengagne was criticised by the [[European Center for Law and Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.aclj.org/pdf/eclj_memo_coe_dangers_creationism_education_07052007.pdf Memorandum on Council of Europe legislation, Draft Resoluion Regarding Report on "The Dangers of Creationism in Education"] [[European Center for Law and Justice]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;After the rejection of Lengagne's report, the former rapporteur was interviewed on the subject by the French newspaper ''[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]]'', where he evaluated the events as follows: "We are witnessing a return to the Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Lengagne |first=Guy |author-link=:fr:Guy Lengagne |interviewer=''20 Minutes'' |title='Le Conseil de l'Europe cède à des religieux intégristes' |trans-title=The Council of Europe yields to religious fundamentalists |language=fr |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/france/167016-conseil-europe-cede-a-religieux-integristes |newspaper=[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]] |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=[[Schibsted]] |date=June 27, 2007 |access-date=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution was criticised by deputy head of the Department for External Church Relations of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Archpriest]] [[:ru:Чаплин, Всеволод Анатольевич|Vsevolod Chaplin]], stating that "those few fossils presented by the anthropologists as examples of ape-human transitional forms could be explained by random mutations.

In February 2009, the resolution was a starting point of a conference held in [[Dortmund|Dortmund, Germany]], and led by Dittmar Graf from the [[Dortmund University of Technology]]. The conference, including participation of Anne Brasseur, among others, was held in cooperation with the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology]], [[University of Vienna]] and [[Hacettepe University]] and with support from German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Ministry of Education and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hemminger |first=Hansjörg |author-link=:de:Hansjörg Hemminger |date=April 2009 |title=Einstellungen zu Evolution und Wissenschaft in Europa |url=http://www.ekd.de/ezw/Publikationen_berichte_einstellungen_zu_evolution.php |journal=Materialdienst |language=de |access-date=2014-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205003159/http://www.ekd.de/ezw/Publikationen_berichte_einstellungen_zu_evolution.php |archive-date=2011-02-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Poole, a [[King's College London]] Visiting Research Fellow in Science and Religion and a founding member of the [[International Society for Science and Religion]], criticised the resolution for being too restrictive while disapproving of [[young Earth creationism]] and the [[intelligent design movement]].&lt;ref name="Poole_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poole |first=Michael |date=September 2008 |title=Creationism, intelligent design and science education |url=http://www.issr.org.uk/documents/SSR_Sept_2008_Poole.pdf |journal=[[The Association for Science Education#Journals|School Science Review]] |volume=90 |issue=330 |pages=123–129 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929020848/http://www.issr.org.uk/documents/SSR_Sept_2008_Poole.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-29 |access-date=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deutsche Welle]], covering the disagreement among members of the Assembly on whether the resolution constituted an attack on religious beliefs,&lt;ref name="dw-world.de"/&gt; and ''[[Die Welt]]'', pointing to journalists-expressed suspicions of wishing to limit freedom of conscience and Brasseur's response that the aim was to draw a line between the spheres of faith and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Europäisches Gremium verurteilt Kreationismus |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article1236940/Europaeisches-Gremium-verurteilt-Kreationismus.html |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |language=de |location=Berlin |publisher=[[Axel Springer AG|Axel Springer SE]] |date=October 5, 2007 |access-date=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
On April 25, 2007, Member of Parliament [[:da:Martin Henriksen|Martin Henriksen]] ([[Danish People's Party]]) asked [[Education Minister of Denmark|Education Minister]] [[Bertel Haarder]] ([[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party of Denmark]]) for information about how many educational institutions had received ''[[The Atlas of Creation]]'' (2006) by [[Adnan Oktar|Harun Yahya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.dk/Samling/20061/spoergsmaal/S4310/index.htm |title=§ 20-spørgsmål S 4310 Om bogen "Atlas of Creation" |last=Henriksen |first=Martin |author-link=:da:Martin Henriksen |date=April 25, 2007 |website=Folketinget |publisher=[[Folketing|The Danish Parliament]] |location=Copenhagen, Kingdom of Denmark |language=da |trans-title=§ 20-question S 4310 About the book 'Atlas of Creation' |access-date=2014-06-19}}

Further, he stated that the choice of educational materials is decided by local school boards. Moreover, it is his view that the end goal of primary school biology instruction is to enable students to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to explain the basic elements of [[heredity]] and evolution and to address the issues related to the biological coursework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.dk/samling/20061/spoergsmaal/s4310/svar/332659/372118.pdf |title=Undervisningsminister Bertel Haarders skriftlige svar til medlem af Folketinget Martin Henriksen (DF) på spørgsmål af 25. april 2007 nr.

===Iran===
[[Iran]]ian [[Science and technology in Iran|scientific development]], especially the health-related aspects of [[biology]], has been a goal of the Islamic government since the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.&lt;ref name="BurtonIRNKSA"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burton |first=Elise K. |date=May–June 2010 |title=Teaching Evolution in Muslim States:Iran and Saudi Arabia Compared |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19234639/1613108208/name/Iran%20and%20Saudi%20Arabia%20Compared.pdf |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=25–29 |access-date=2014-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219014741/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19234639/1613108208/name/Iran%20and%20Saudi%20Arabia%20Compared.pdf |archive-date=2018-02-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Iranian traditional practice of [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] religion isn't preoccupied with [[Quran|Qur'anic]] literalism as in case of fundamentalist [[Wahhabi movement|Wahhabism]] but [[ijtihad]], many influential Iranian Shi'ite scholars, including several who were closely involved in the Iranian Revolution, are not opposed to evolutionary ideas in general, disagreeing that evolution necessarily conflicts with the [[Muslim]] mainstream.&lt;ref name="BurtonIRNKSA" /&gt; Evolution is incorporated in the science curriculum starting from the 5th grade. An emphasis is placed on empirical evidence, such as the study of fossils, rather than Islamic scripture, thus portraying [[geologist]]s and other types of scientists as the authoritative voices of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="BurtonIRNKSA" /&gt;

===Japan===
The theory of evolution is taught in Japan as part of the education policy. The teaching of evolution began already under the [[Japanese Empire]], and the first academic lecture on evolution was given at Tokyo Imperial University by American biology expert Edward Morse on September 12, 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Morse, ''Japan Day by Day'' (New York, 1917), vol. 1, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] some factions teach creationism in their own schools, besides evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Stefaan Blancke en Abraham C.

She sought to "stimulate an academic debate" on the subject.

===Norway===
In 1986, Norway's then-[[Ministry of Education and Research (Norway)|Minister of Church and Education Affairs]] [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] proposed new education plans for the elementary and middle school levels which included skepticism to the theory of evolution and would hold that a final answer to the origin of mankind was unknown.

===Poland===
[[Poland]] saw a controversy over creationism in 2006 when Deputy Education Minister [[Mirosław Orzechowski]] denounced evolution as a lie taught in Polish schools. His superior, [[Ministry of National Education (Poland)|Minister of National Education]] [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, "as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory." Giertych's father, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Maciej Giertych]], has however opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that "in every culture there are indications that we remember [[dinosaur]]s. The Scots have [[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]]; we Poles have the [[Wawel Dragon|Wawel dragon]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 18, 2006 |title=And finally... |url=http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=35336&amp;type=wbj |newspaper=[[Warsaw Business Journal]] |location=Warsaw, Poland |publisher=Valkea Media |access-date=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
In 1998, Ioan Moisin, a [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|Christian Democratic]] senator and a Greek Catholic priest, called upon [[Romania]]'s [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Ministry of Education]] to establish a commission of Catholics who would revise biology textbooks and philosophical textbooks to not contradict [[Bible|Biblical]] creationism. Moisin disapproved of students learning from their religious teachers that [[God]] created [[Human|human beings]] and then learning to the contrary from biology and philosophy teachers that humans descend from [[ape]]s as a product of evolution by Darwinian [[natural selection]]. Moisin's proposal to establish the commission also sought to form a Council of Public Morality that would feature representatives composed of teachers and clergy, to oversee public education, and to be subordinated only to the direct authority of the [[President of Romania]]. Romania's [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] and Ministry of Education never seriously considered the latter proposals.&lt;ref name="Stan &amp; Turcescu 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stan |first1=Lavinia |author-link1=Lavinia Stan |last2=Turcescu |first2=Lucian |author-link2=Lucian Turcescu |date=September 2005 |title=Religious education in Romania |journal=Communist and Post-Communist Studies |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=381–401 |doi=10.1016/j.postcomstud.2005.06.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, starting the year 2006 and ongoing{{When|date=December 2017}} Darwinian evolution was discontinued from newly printed school books throughout the country without being reintroduced.&lt;ref name="hotnews.ro [in Romanian]"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-2456107-cum-batut-europenii-americanii-pentru-darwin-dumnezeu.htm |title=Cum s-au batut europenii si americanii pentru Darwin si Dumnezeu [How Europeans and the US fought for Darwin and god] |date=February 27, 2008 |access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contributors.ro [in Romanian]"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contributors.ro/administratie/educatie/teoria-evolutiei-trebuie-sa-se-predea-din-nou-in-scolile-din-romania/ |title=Teoria evoluţiei trebuie să se predea din nou în şcolile din România [Evolution must be taught again in Romanian schools] |date=January 23, 2015 |access-date=2017-12-23}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In December 2006, a schoolgirl in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and her father took the issue of the teaching of evolution in Russian schools to court. The [[Russian Ministry of Education]] supports the theory of evolution. Representatives of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] backed the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Niedowski |first=Erika |date=January 3, 2007 |title= In Russia, a test of God vs. Darwin |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-01-03/news/0701030102_1_darwin-theory-theory-of-evolution-charles-darwin |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |location=Chicago, IL |publisher =[[Tribune Company]] |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leonov | first=Maksim |date=March 1, 2006 |title=St. Petersburg schoolgirl sues authorities over Darwinism |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20060301/43853593.html |location=Moscow |agency= [[RIA Novosti]] |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, the first instance court, and in July, the second instance court, ruled in favour of the Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | script-title=ru:Суд Санкт-Петербурга отклонил иск о преподавании теории Дарвина |url=http://ria.ru/society/20070704/68336516.html | location=Moscow |agency=RIA Novosti |language=ru |date=July 4, 2007 |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
As a religious state, [[Saudi Arabia]] has denied the theory of evolution in their science education. Science textbooks approved by the [[Ministry of Education (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi Ministry of Education]] have associated Darwin with [[Western philosophy]] which they reject and perceive to be "problematic".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burton|first=Elise K.|date=2011|title=Evolution and Creationism in Middle Eastern Education: A New Perspective|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01113.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=65|issue=1|pages=301–304|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01113.x|pmid=20812978|s2cid=24706684|issn=1558-5646|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi's denial of evolution originated from the lack of [[secularization]] in the nation, the continuing development of its [[Education in Saudi Arabia|education system]], and its homogenic religious population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]], the only co-ed university in the state, received criticism for its co-ed establishment and was called for further scrutiny in its science curriculum.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Alsharif|first=Asma|date=2009-10-01|title=Saudi cleric to king's university: don't teach evolution, mix sexes|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2009/10/01/saudi-cleric-to-kings-university-dont-teach-evolution-mix-sexes/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004122713/http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2009/10/01/saudi-cleric-to-kings-university-dont-teach-evolution-mix-sexes/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-10-04|access-date=2020-08-25|website=Reuters Blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Council of Senior Scholars (Saudi Arabia)|Sheikh Saad al-Shithri]], a religious scholar, stated that ''"''the recommendation is to set up sharia committees at this university to oversee these studies and look into what violates the sharia ([[Sharia|Islamic law]])"''.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He further states, "We are looking at some of the sciences that have included some irregular and alien ideologies, like evolution and such other ideologies"''.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to a poll by [[Reuters|Reuters News]], Saudi Arabia was ranked the highest in the list of countries that favor creationist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Polling creationism and evolution around the world {{!}} National Center for Science Education|url=https://ncse.ngo/polling-creationism-and-evolution-around-world|access-date=2020-08-25|website=ncse.ngo|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an Islamist state, Saudi education policies are centered around an Islamic worldview.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burton|first=Elise K.|title=Teaching Evolution in Muslim States: Iran and Saudi Arabia Compared|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19234639/1613108208/name/Iran%20and%20Saudi%20Arabia%20Compared.pdf|journal=NCSE Reports|volume=30|pages=25–29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219014741/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19234639/1613108208/name/Iran%20and%20Saudi%20Arabia%20Compared.pdf|archive-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is referenced in various science textbooks, such a 6th grade textbook teaching [[Intelligent design|divine creation]] by citing a Quran verse that states "we have indeed created man with the best of moulds".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 10th grade textbook includes a glossary of biological terms with religious explanation, such as the term [[adaptation]] being defined as "Allah, glory to him, created for organisms those characteristics and structures that enable them to live in their different environments".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A Saudi 12th-grade textbook mentions evolution by name only where it claims that Charles Darwin has "denied [[Allah]]'s creation of humanity".&lt;ref name="BurtonIRNKSA" /&gt; The rest of the textbook focuses on descriptions of the taxonomic ranks: it makes no further mention of evolution, only quoting Qur'an verses as relevant to certain groups of animals.&lt;ref name="BurtonIRNKSA" /&gt;

===Serbia===
In [[Serbia]] the teaching of evolution was suspended for one week in 2004, under [[Cabinet of Serbia (2004–07)|Minister of Education and Sport]] [[Ljiljana Čolić]], only allowing schools to reintroduce evolution into the curriculum if they also taught creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=de Quetteville |first=Harry |date=September 9, 2004 |title=Darwin is off the curriculum for Serbian schools |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1471367/Darwin-is-off-the-curriculum-for-Serbian-schools.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "After a deluge of protest from scientists, teachers and opposition parties" says the [[BBC]] report, Čolić's deputy, Milan Brdar, made the statement, "I have come here to confirm [[Charles Darwin]] is still alive" and announced that the decision was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 9, 2004 |title=Serbia reverses Darwin suspension |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3642460.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čolić resigned after the government said that she had caused "problems that had started to reflect on the work of the entire government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 16, 2004 |title='Anti-Darwin' Serb minister quits |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3663196.stm |work=BBC News |location=London |publisher=BBC |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], a country where the majority of population is Muslim, evolution is often a controversial subject. Evolution was added to the school curriculum shortly after the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish Revolution]] of the 1920s and 30s.&lt;ref name="Edis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edis |first=Taner |author-link=Taner Edis |date=January 2008 |title=Islamic Creationism: A Short History |url=http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2008/NewsletterJanuary2008Creationism.html |journal=Newsletter |volume=37 |issue=1 |issn=0739-4934 |access-date=2008-02-24 |quote=...Islam has been the world religion that has proved most resistant to Darwinian evolution. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716061337/http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2008/NewsletterJanuary2008Creationism.html |archive-date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some resistance to this, such as that of [[Said Nursî]] and his followers, but opposition was not particularly powerful.&lt;ref name="Edis" /&gt; In fact, some prominent Turkish scholars during the first decades of the new-born Turkish republic, such as [[:tr:Ahmet Hamdi Akseki|Ahmet Hamdi Akseki]] (d. 1951), who once served as the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|President of Religious Affairs of Turkey]], and İzmirli İsmail Hakkı (d. 1946) thought that the theory of evolution cannot be seen as contrary to Islam because it was already to be found in the classical works of Muslim theology.&lt;ref name=VKaya&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaya |first=Veysel |date=April 2012 |title=Can the Quran Support Darwin? An Evolutionist Approach by Two Turkish Scholars after the Foundation of the Turkish Republic |journal=The Muslim World |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=357–370 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2011.01362.x |issn=1478-1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, conservatives came into power, and used the ideas of [[Creation science|scientific creationists]] in the [[United States|US]] as a method of discrediting evolution (notwithstanding material on the [[age of the Earth]], which [[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic creationism]] is less specific about).

One anti-evolutionist group in Turkey is the [[Istanbul]] based ''[[:tr:Bilim Araştırma Vakfı|Bilim Araştırma Vakfı]]'' (BAV), or "Science Research Foundation," which was founded by [[Adnan Oktar]] in 1990. Its activities include campaigns against the teaching of evolution. It has been described as one of the strongest anti-evolution organizations outside of [[North America]].&lt;ref name=Koenig&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koenig |first=Robert |date=May 18, 2001 |title=Creationism Takes Root Where Europe, Asia Meet |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1286–1287 |doi=10.1126/science.292.5520.1286 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11360976 |s2cid=5404903 |quote=Harassed but hard-headed, some gutsy Turkish scientists are stepping up their efforts to promote the teaching of the theory of evolution...}}&lt;/ref&gt; US based creationist organizations such as the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) have worked alongside them.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; Some scientists have protested that anti-evolution books published by this group (such as ''The Evolution Deceit'' (1999) by Harun Yahya) have become more influential than real biology textbooks.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; The teaching of evolution in high schools has been fought by Ali Gören, a member of parliament and professor of medicine, who believes such education has negative effects.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt;

The situation is very fragile, and the status of evolution in education varies from one government to the next. For example, in 1985 the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Minister of National Education, Youth and Sports]] [[:tr:Vehbi Dinçerler|Vehbi Dinçerler]] had scientific creationism added to high school texts, and also had the discredited [[Lamarckism]] presented alongside [[Darwinism]].&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; Only in 1998 was this changed somewhat, with texts presenting a more balanced view, though still mentioning creationism and Lamarckism.&lt;ref name=Koenig /&gt; At present the moderate Islamist [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]], which is sympathetic to creationist views,&lt;ref name="Edis" /&gt; holds power. It was elected in 2002 and again with a greater majority in 2007.

In general, material that conflicts with religious beliefs is highly controversial in Turkey. For example, in November 2007 a prosecutor launched a probe into whether Richard Dawkins' book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006) is "an attack on religious values." If convicted, the Turkish publisher and translator, Erol Karaaslan, would have faced a prison sentence of inciting religious hatred and insulting religious values.&lt;ref name="AP_2007-11-28"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Turkey probes atheist's 'God' book |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/28/dawkins.turkey.ap/index.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 28, 2007 |location=New York |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813055357/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/28/dawkins.turkey.ap/index.html |archive-date=2007-08-13 |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, the defendant was acquitted by a court and a judge ruled against banning the book due to the fact that it limited freedom of thought.&lt;ref name='NTVMSNBC 2008-04-02'&gt;{{cite news | title='Tanrı Yanılgısı' kitabı beraat etti | date=2 April 2008 | publisher=AA | url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/441428.asp | access-date=2 April 2008 | language=tr | archive-date=5 April 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405153938/http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/441428.asp | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish academics who have defended evolutionary theory have received [[death threat]]s, for instance Turkish biologist Aykut Kence received an email telling him to enjoy his "final days."&lt;ref name=Koenig /&gt; Kence helped establish the Evolution Group, whose aim is to improve public understanding of evolution.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; However, opposition to creationism is not very powerful; Umit Sayin, a neurologist, describes academics and universities as "slow and sluggish" in their response.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; Kence maintains that "if knowledgeable people keep quiet, it only helps those who spread nonsense."&lt;ref name=Koenig /&gt;

In June 2017, the education ministry announced the removal of evolution from the secondary school curriculum, scheduled to take effect in 2019; as of the date of the announcement the only other Muslim majority country where evolution is challenged in the education system was Saudi Arabia, where the concept is briefly named and heavily criticized in the curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingsley|first1=Patrick|title=Turkey Drops Evolution From Curriculum, Angering Secularists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/world/europe/turkey-evolution-high-school-curriculum.html|work=The New York Times|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |author-link1=Kendrick Frazier |title=CFI, Richard Dawkins, Teachers Slam as 'Unconscionable' Turkey's Decision to Ban Teaching Evolution |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In each of the countries of the [[United Kingdom]], there is an agreed syllabus for religious education with the right of parents to withdraw their children from these lessons. The religious education syllabus does not involve teaching creationism, but rather teaching the central tenets of major world faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2002/13989.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2002: United Kingdom |website=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the teaching of evolution is compulsory in publicly funded schools. For instance, the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] for [[England]] requires that students at Key Stage 4 (14–16) be taught:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Creationism |house=House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060227/text/60227131.htm |date=February 27, 2006 |column_start=518W |column_end=519W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# that the fossil record is evidence for evolution
# how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction

Similar requirements exist in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

In 2003, the [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]] (previously the Vardy Foundation after its founder, [[Peter Vardy (businessman)|Sir Peter Vardy]]) sponsored a number of "faith-based" academies where evolution and creationist ideas would be taught side-by-side in science classes. This caused a considerable amount of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Matthew |date=May 30, 2006 |title=Parents rebel at 'Dickensian' school run by millionaire evangelist friend of Blair |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/may/30/politics.schools |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organisation called [[Truth in Science]] has distributed teaching packs of creationist information to schools, and claims that fifty-nine schools are using the packs as "a useful classroom resource."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=November 26, 2006 |title=Revealed: rise of creationism in UK schools |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/nov/27/controversiesinscience.religion |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |access-date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has stated that "Neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories and they are not included in the science curriculum.

'''CRISPR gene editing ''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|i|s|p|ə|r}} "crisper") is a [[genetic engineering]] technique in [[molecular biology]] by which the [[genome]]s of living organisms may be modified. It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial [[CRISPR]]-[[Cas9]] antiviral defense system. By delivering the Cas9 [[nuclease]] complexed with a synthetic [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bak RO, Gomez-Ospina N, Porteus MH | title = Gene Editing on Center Stage | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 600–611 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29908711 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2018.05.004 | s2cid = 49269023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is considered highly significant in biotechnology and medicine as it enables editing genomes ''in vivo'' very precisely, cheaply, and easily. It can be used in the creation of new medicines, agricultural products, and [[genetically modified organisms]], or as a means of controlling pathogens and pests. It also has possibilities in the treatment of inherited [[genetic diseases]] as well as diseases arising from [[somatic mutation]]s such as cancer. However, its use in [[human germline engineering|human germline genetic modification]] is highly controversial. The development of the technique earned [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2020.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/ceremony-speech/|access-date=2020-12-10|website=The Nobel Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.science.org/content/article/crispr-revolutionary-genetic-scissors-honored-chemistry-nobel|title= CRISPR, the revolutionary genetic "scissors," honored by Chemistry Nobel |date=October 7, 2020|journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.abf0540 | vauthors= Cohen J |s2cid= 225116732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third researcher group that shared the [[Kavli Prize]] for the same discovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With prestigious prize, an overshadowed CRISPR researcher wins the spotlight |url=https://www.science.org/content/article/prestigious-prize-overshadowed-crispr-researcher-wins-spotlight| vauthors = Cohen J | date=2018-06-04|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en|access-date=2020-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Virginijus Šikšnys#Publication of CRISPR-Cas|Virginijus Šikšnys]], was not awarded the Nobel prize.&lt;ref name="Owens 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lithuanian scientists not awarded Nobel prize despite discovering same technology. | url = https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1248357/lithuanian-scientists-not-awarded-nobel-prize-despite-discovering-same-technology | work = LRT.LT | date = 8 October 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title  = Imam genų žirkles, iškerpam klaidą, ligos nelieka | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NQqKMyXSYQ&amp;t=12m22s | access-date = 2018-06-30 | series = Laisvės TV / Freedom TV | vauthors = Šikšnys V | network = LaisvėsTV | date = 2018-06-16 | minutes = 12:22 | transcript = &lt;...&gt;Tai mes tą savo straipsnį išsiuntėm į redakciją pirmieji, bet laimės ten daug nebuvo.

Working like genetic scissors, the Cas9 nuclease opens both strands of the targeted sequence of [[DNA]] to introduce the modification by one of two methods. Knock-in mutations, facilitated via [[homology directed repair]] (HDR), is the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This allows for the introduction of targeted [[DNA repair|DNA damage and repair]]. HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for the repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by CRISPR-Cas9 result in the repair of the double-stranded break by means of [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ). NHEJ can often result in random deletions or insertions at the repair site, which may disrupt or alter gene functionality. Therefore, genomic engineering by CRISPR-Cas9 gives researchers the ability to generate targeted random gene disruption. Because of this, the precision of genome editing is a great concern. Genomic editing leads to irreversible changes to the genome.

While [[genome editing]] in eukaryotic cells has been possible using various methods since the 1980s, the methods employed had proved to be inefficient and impractical to implement on a large scale. With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing is now a reality. Cas9 derived from the bacterial species ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' has facilitated targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells by allowing for a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRNA guide strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang JH, Pandey M, Kahler JF, Loshakov A, Harris B, Dagur PK, Mo YY, Simonds WF | display-authors = 6 | title = Improving the specificity and efficacy of CRISPR/CAS9 and gRNA through target specific DNA reporter | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 189 | pages = 1–8 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25193712 | pmc = 4252756 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ease with which researchers can insert Cas9 and template RNA in order to [[gene silencing|silence]] or cause [[point mutation]]s at specific [[locus (genetics)|loci]] has proved invaluable to the quick and efficient [[gene mapping|mapping]] of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes. Newly engineered variants of the Cas9 nuclease have been developed that significantly reduce off-target activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vakulskas CA, Dever DP, Rettig GR, Turk R, Jacobi AM, Collingwood MA, Bode NM, McNeill MS, Yan S, Camarena J, Lee CM, Park SH, Wiebking V, Bak RO, Gomez-Ospina N, Pavel-Dinu M, Sun W, Bao G, Porteus MH, Behlke MA | display-authors = 6 | title = A high-fidelity Cas9 mutant delivered as a ribonucleoprotein complex enables efficient gene editing in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1216–1224 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30082871 | pmc = 6107069 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-018-0137-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques have many potential applications, including in medicine and agriculture.

==History==
=== Other methods ===
In the early 2000s, German researchers began developing [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose [[DNA-binding domains]] enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. ZFNs has a higher precision and the advantage of being smaller than Cas9, but ZFNs are not as commonly used as CRISPR-based methods. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the design and creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a much more difficult and time-consuming process than that of designing guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires synthesizing only a short RNA sequence, a procedure that is already widely used for many other molecular biology techniques (e.g. creating [[oligonucleotide]] [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]]).&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young S | date=11 February 2014 |title= CRISPR and Other Genome Editing Tools Boost Medical Research and Gene Therapy's Reach |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery|access-date=2014-04-13 |journal=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas methods such as [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) do not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]], and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] provide full irreversible [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref name="Heidenreich_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidenreich M, Zhang F | title = Applications of CRISPR-Cas systems in neuroscience | journal = Nature Reviews.

In addition, the costs of employing CRISPR are relatively low.&lt;ref name="Heidenreich_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R, Doudna JA | title = Applications of CRISPR technologies in research and beyond | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 933–941 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27606440 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3659 | s2cid = 21543486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cox DB, Platt RJ, Zhang F | title = Therapeutic genome editing: prospects and challenges | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–131 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25654603 | pmc = 4492683 | doi = 10.1038/nm.3793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
In 2012 [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] published their finding that CRISPR-[[Cas9]] could be programmed with RNA to edit genomic DNA, now considered one of the most significant discoveries in the [[history of biology]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20150511"&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Pollack A |title= Jennifer Doudna, a Pioneer Who Helped Simplify Genome Editing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/science/jennifer-doudna-crispr-cas9-genetic-engineering.html |date=May 11, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=October 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patents and commercialization ===
{{as of|2013|November}}, SAGE Labs (part of [[Horizon Discovery]] group) had [[exclusive right]]s from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and non-exclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genengnews.com/insight-and-intelligence/crispr-madness/77899947/ | title = CRISPR Madness | website = GEN | date = 2013-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015|alt=By 2015}}, [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]] had licensed intellectual property from ToolGen to develop CRISPR reagent kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Staff|date=1 April 2015|title=News: Products &amp; Services|journal=[[Gen. Eng. Biotechnol. News|Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News]]|type=Paper|volume=35|issue=7|page=8|doi=10.1089/gen.35.21.05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014|December}}, [[patent rights]] to CRISPR were contested. Several companies formed to develop related drugs and research tools.&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/12/04/170211/who-owns-the-biggest-biotech-discovery-of-the-century/ | title = Who Owns the Biggest Biotech Discovery of the Century? There's a bitter fight over the patents for CRISPR, a breakthrough new form of DNA editing | website = MIT [[Technology Review]] | access-date = 25 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As companies ramped up financing, doubts as to whether CRISPR could be quickly monetized were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Fye S | title=Genetic Rough Draft: Editas and CRISPR | url = http://atlasbusinessjournal.org/genetics/ |  website = The Atlas Business Journal | access-date = 19 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard  and nine others were awarded patent number 8697359 over the use of CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing in eukaryotes. Although Charpentier and Doudna (referred to as CVC) were credited for the conception of CRISPR, the Broad Institute was the first to achieve a "reduction to practice" according to patent judges Sally Gardner Lane, James T. Moore and Deborah Katz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shaffer C | title = Broad defeats Berkeley CRISPR patent | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 445 | date = April 2022 | pmid = 35288688 | doi = 10.1038/d41587-022-00004-2 | s2cid = 247453528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first set of patents was awarded to the Broad team in 2015, prompting attorneys for the CVC group to request the first interference proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = CRISPR patents to go on trial | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 121 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26849500 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0216-121a | s2cid = 205265912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 the US Patent Office ruled on a [[patent interference]] case brought by University of California with respect to patents issued to the [[Broad Institute]], and found that the Broad patents, with claims covering the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, were distinct from the inventions claimed by University of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Pollack A | title = Harvard and M.I.T.

Shortly after, University of California filed an appeal of this ruling.&lt;ref name="Potenza"&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Potenza A | title = UC Berkeley challenges decision that CRISPR patents belong to Broad Institute | url = https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15278478/crispr-gene-editing-tool-patent-dispute-appeal-ucb-mit-broad | access-date=22 September 2017 | work=The Verge|date=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buhr"&gt;{{cite news| vauthors = Buhr S |title=The CRISPR patent battle is back on as UC Berkeley files an appeal|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/the-crispr-patent-battle-is-back-on-as-uc-berkeley-files-an-appeal/|access-date=22 September 2017|work=TechCrunch|date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019 the second interference dispute was opened. This was in response to patent applications made by CVC that required the appeals board to determine the original inventor of the technology. The USPTO ruled in March 2022 against UC, stating that the Broad Institute were first to file. The decision affected many of the licensing agreements for the CRISPR editing technology that was licensed from UC Berkeley. UC stated its intent to appeal the USPTO's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22956326/crispr-patent-uc-berkeley-broad-institute-nobel | title = UC Berkeley loses CRISPR patent case | vauthors = Westman N | date = March 1, 2022 | access-date = March 6, 2022 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a [[CRISPR#Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes|Type II]] CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes [[Cas9]], crRNA, and tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) or [[homology directed repair]] (HDR).

[[CRISPR-Cas9]] often employs a [[plasmid]] to [[Transfection|transfect]] the target cells.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table. The crRNA is uniquely designed for each application, as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to specific sequences within the host cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is also uniquely designed for each application, as it must complement to some degree the DNA sequences on either side of the cut and also contain whatever sequence is desired for insertion into the host genome.

Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://archive.org/details/LyJosephP201311PhDThesis |title=Discovering Genes Responsible for Kidney Diseases | vauthors = Ly J |year=2013 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Toronto |access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sgRNA can be included alongside the gene that codes for the Cas9 protein and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.

=== Structure ===
CRISPR-Cas9 offers a high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM) sequence. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–2308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 | hdl = 1721.1/102943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–170 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 | s2cid = 17960960 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialk P, Rivera-Torres N, Strouse B, Kmiec EB | title = Regulation of Gene Editing Activity Directed by Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides and CRISPR/Cas9 Systems | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e0129308 | date = 2015-06-08 | pmid = 26053390 | pmc = 4459703 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0129308 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1029308B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9. Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence. However, this is ultimately not too limiting, as it is typically a very short and nonspecific sequence that occurs frequently at many places throughout the genome (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt;

Once these sequences have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells, the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single- or double-stranded break at the appropriate location in the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sander JD, Joung JK | title = CRISPR-Cas systems for editing, regulating and targeting genomes | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 347–355 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24584096 | pmc = 4022601 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly spaced single-stranded breaks in the host DNA can trigger [[homology directed repair]], which is less error-prone than the [[non-homologous end joining]] that typically follows a double-stranded break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9-induced DNA break.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The goal is for the cell's native HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.

=== Controlled genome editing ===
Further improvements and variants of the CRISPR-Cas9 system have focused on introducing more control into its use. Specifically, the research aimed at improving this system includes improving its specificity, its efficiency, and the granularity of its editing power. Techniques can further be divided and classified by the component of the system they modify. These include using a different variants or novel creations of the Cas protein, using an altogether different effector protein, modifying the sgRNA, or using an algorithmic approach to identify existing optimal solutions.

Specificity is an important aspect to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 system because the off-target effects it generates have serious consequences for the genome of the cell and invokes caution for its use. Minimizing off-target effects is thus maximizing the safety of the system. Novel variations of Cas9 proteins that increase specificity include effector proteins with comparable efficiency and specificity to the original SpCas9 that are able to target the previously untargetable sequences and a variant that has virtually no off-target mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cui Z, Tian R, Huang Z, Jin Z, Li L, Liu J, Huang Z, Xie H, Liu D, Mo H, Zhou R, Lang B, Meng B, Weng H, Hu Z | display-authors = 6 | title = FrCas9 is a CRISPR/Cas9 system with high editing efficiency and fidelity | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 1425 | date = March 2022 | pmid = 35301321 | pmc = 8931148 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-022-29089-8 | bibcode = 2022NatCo..13.1425C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinstiver BP, Pattanayak V, Prew MS, Tsai SQ, Nguyen NT, Zheng Z, Joung JK | title = High-fidelity CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with no detectable genome-wide off-target effects | journal = Nature | volume = 529 | issue = 7587 | pages = 490–495 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26735016 | pmc = 4851738 | doi = 10.1038/nature16526 | bibcode = 2016Natur.529..490K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also been conducted in engineering new Cas9 proteins, including some that partially replace RNA nucleotides in crRNA with DNA and a structure-guided Cas9 mutant generating procedure that all had reduced off-target effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slaymaker IM, Gao L, Zetsche B, Scott DA, Yan WX, Zhang F | title = Rationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity | journal = Science | volume = 351 | issue = 6268 | pages = 84–88 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26628643 | pmc = 4714946 | doi = 10.1126/science.aad5227 | bibcode = 2016Sci...351...84S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yin H, Song CQ, Suresh S, Kwan SY, Wu Q, Walsh S, Ding J, Bogorad RL, Zhu LJ, Wolfe SA, Koteliansky V, Xue W, Langer R, Anderson DG | display-authors = 6 | title = Partial DNA-guided Cas9 enables genome editing with reduced off-target activity | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–316 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29377001 | pmc = 5902734 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.2559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iteratively truncated sgRNAs and highly stabilized gRNAs have been shown to also decrease off-target effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riesenberg S, Helmbrecht N, Kanis P, Maricic T, Pääbo S | title = Improved gRNA secondary structures allow editing of target sites resistant to CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 489 | date = January 2022 | pmid = 35078986 | pmc = 8789806 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-022-28137-7 | s2cid = 246281892 | bibcode = 2022NatCo..13..489R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu Y, Sander JD, Reyon D, Cascio VM, Joung JK | title = Improving CRISPR-Cas nuclease specificity using truncated guide RNAs | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–284 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24463574 | pmc = 3988262 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational methods including machine learning have been used to predict the affinity of and create unique sequences for the system to maximize specificity for given targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thean DG, Chu HY, Fong JH, Chan BK, Zhou P, Kwok CC, Chan YM, Mak SY, Choi GC, Ho JW, Zheng Z, Wong AS | display-authors = 6 | title = Machine learning-coupled combinatorial mutagenesis enables resource-efficient engineering of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editor activities | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 2219 | date = April 2022 | pmid = 35468907 | pmc = 9039034 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-022-29874-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho SW, Kim S, Kim Y, Kweon J, Kim HS, Bae S, Kim JS | title = Analysis of off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas-derived RNA-guided endonucleases and nickases | journal = Genome Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 132–141 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24253446 | pmc = 3875854 | doi = 10.1101/gr.162339.113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, is a two-vector system: sgRNA and Cas9 plasmids are delivered separately.&lt;ref name="Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout a"/&gt; It's important to deliver thousands of unique sgRNAs-containing vectors to a single vessel of cells by viral transduction at low [[multiplicity of infection]] (MOI, typically at 0.1-0.6), it prevents the probability that an individual cell clone will get more than one type of sgRNA otherwise it can lead to incorrect assignment of [[genotype]] to [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Once pooled library is prepared it is necessary to carry out a deep sequencing (NGS, next generation sequencing) of PCR-amplifed plasmid DNA in order to reveal abundance of sgRNAs. Cells of interest can be consequentially infected by the library and then selected according to the phenotype. There are 2 types of selection: negative and positive. By negative selection dead or slow growing cells are efficiently detected. It can identify survival-essential genes, which can be further serve as candidates for molecularly targeted drugs. On the other hand, positive selection gives a collection of growth-advantage acquired populations by random mutagenesis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After selection genomic DNA is collected and sequenced by NGS. Depletion or enrichment of sgRNAs is detected and compared to the original sgRNA library, annotated with the target gene that sgRNA corresponds to. Statistical analysis then identify genes that are significantly likely to be relevant to the phenotype of interest.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Apart from knock-out there are also knock-down (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa) libraries, which using the ability of proteolytically deactivated Cas9-fusion proteins (dCas9) to bind target DNA, which means that gene of interest is not cut but is over-expressed or repressed. It made CRISPR/Cas9 system even more interesting in gene editing. Inactive dCas9 protein modulate gene expression by targeting dCas9-repressors or activators toward promoter or transcriptional start sites of target genes. For repressing genes Cas9 can be fused to KRAB effector domain that makes complex with gRNA, whereas CRISPRa utilizes dCas9 fused to different transcriptional activation domains, which are further directed by gRNA to promoter regions to upregulate expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDade JR, Waxmonsky NC, Swanson LE, Fan M | title = Practical Considerations for Using Pooled Lentiviral CRISPR Libraries | journal = Current Protocols in Molecular Biology | volume = 115 | issue = 1 | pages = 31.5.1–31.5.13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27366891 | doi = 10.1002/cpmb.8 | s2cid = 5055878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng AW, Wang H, Yang H, Shi L, Katz Y, Theunissen TW, Rangarajan S, Shivalila CS, Dadon DB, Jaenisch R | display-authors = 6 | title = Multiplexed activation of endogenous genes by CRISPR-on, an RNA-guided transcriptional activator system | journal = Cell Research | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1163–1171 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23979020 | pmc = 3790238 | doi = 10.1038/cr.2013.122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Horlbeck MA, Adamson B, Villalta JE, Chen Y, Whitehead EH, Guimaraes C, Panning B, Ploegh HL, Bassik MC, Qi LS, Kampmann M, Weissman JS | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-Scale CRISPR-Mediated Control of Gene Repression and Activation | journal = Cell | volume = 159 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–661 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25307932 | pmc = 4253859 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
=== Disease models ===
Cas9 genomic modification has allowed for the quick and efficient generation of [[transgene|transgenic]] models within the field of genetics. Cas9 can be easily introduced into the target cells along with sgRNA via plasmid transfection in order to model the spread of diseases and the cell's response to and defense against infection.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dow LE | title = Modeling Disease In Vivo With CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 609–621 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432018 | pmc = 4592741 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2015.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of Cas9 to be introduced ''in vivo'' allows for the creation of more accurate models of gene function and mutation effects, all while avoiding the off-target mutations typically observed with older methods of genetic engineering.

The CRISPR and Cas9 revolution in genomic modeling does not extend only to mammals. Traditional genomic models such as ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', one of the first model organisms, have seen further refinement in their resolution with the use of Cas9.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Cas9 uses cell-specific promoters allowing a controlled use of the Cas9. Cas9 is an accurate method of treating diseases due to the targeting of the Cas9 enzyme only affecting certain cell types. The cells undergoing the Cas9 therapy can also be removed and reintroduced to provide amplified effects of the therapy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Doudna J, Mali P | title = CRISPR-Cas: A Laboratory Manual |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-62182-130-4 |location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York|oclc=922914104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms ''in vivo'' and to eliminate individual genes or even entire [[chromosome]]s from an organism at any point in its development. Chromosomes that have been successfully deleted ''in vivo'' using CRISPR techniques include the Y chromosome and X chromosome of adult lab mice and human chromosomes 14 and 21, in embryonic stem cell lines and [[aneuploid]] mice respectively. This method might be useful for treating genetic disorders caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes, such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[intersex]] disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid29178945"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuo E, Huo X, Yao X, Hu X, Sun Y, Yin J, He B, Wang X, Shi L, Ping J, Wei Y, Ying W, Wei W, Liu W, Tang C, Li Y, Hu J, Yang H | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted chromosome elimination | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 224 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29178945 | pmc = 5701507 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-017-1354-4 }}

==== Blindness ====
The CRISPR treatment for LCA10 (the most common variant of Leber Congenital Amaurosis which is the leading cause of inherited childhood blindness) modifies the patient's defective photoreceptor gene.

In March 2020, the first patient volunteer in this US-based study, sponsored by Editas Medicine, was given a low-dose of the treatment to test for safety.

In June 2021, enrollment began for a high-dose adult  and pediatric cohort of 4 patient volunteers each. Dosing of the new cohorts is expected to be completed by July 2022.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Cancer ====
CRISPR has also found many applications in developing cell-based immunotherapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen TI, Axelgaard E, Bak RO | title = Therapeutic gene editing in haematological disorders with CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 185 | issue = 5 | pages = 821–835 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 30864164 | doi = 10.1111/bjh.15851 | s2cid = 76663873 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first clinical trial involving CRISPR started in 2016. It involved taking immune cells from people with lung cancer, using CRISPR to edit out the gene expressed PD-1, then administrating the altered cells back to the same person. 20 other trials were under way or nearly ready, mostly in China, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2016, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a clinical trial in which CRISPR would be used to alter T cells extracted from people with different kinds of cancer and then administer those engineered T cells back to the same people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20137 |title=First CRISPR clinical trial gets green light from US panel |journal=Nature |year=2016 | vauthors = Reardon S |s2cid=89466280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2020, in mouse animal models, CRISPR was used effectively to treat [[glioblastoma]] (fast-growing brain tumor) and [[metastatic]] [[ovarian cancer]], as those are two cancers with some of the worst best-case prognosis and are typically diagnosed during their later stages. The treatments have resulted in inhibited tumor growth, and increased survival by 80% for metastatic ovarian cancer and tumor cell [[apoptosis]], inhibited tumor growth by 50%, and improved survival by 30% for glioblastoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenblum D, Gutkin A, Kedmi R, Ramishetti S, Veiga N, Jacobi AM, Schubert MS, Friedmann-Morvinski D, Cohen ZR, Behlke MA, Lieberman J, Peer D | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing using targeted lipid nanoparticles for cancer therapy | journal = Science Advances | volume = 6 | issue = 47 | pages = eabc9450 | date = November 2020 | pmid = 33208369 | pmc = 7673804 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.abc9450 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2020SciA....6.9450R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2021, CRISPR Therapeutics announced results from their ongoing US-based Phase 1 trial for an allogeneic T cell therapy. These cells are sourced from healthy donors and are edited to attack cancer cells and avoid being seen as a threat by the recipient's immune system, and then multiplied into huge batches which can be given to large numbers of recipients.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web |title=CRISPR Clinical Trials: A 2022 Update |url=https://innovativegenomics.org/news/crispr-clinical-trials-2022/ |access-date=2022-05-02 |website=Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diabetes ====
Type 1 Diabetes is an endocrine disorder which results from a lack of pancreatic beta cells to produce insulin, a vital compound in transporting blood sugar to cells for producing energy. Researchers have been trying to transplant healthy beta cells. CRISPR is used to edit the cells in order to reduce the chance the patient's body will reject the transplant.

In February 2022, a phase 1 trial was conducted in which one patient volunteer received treatment.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=CRISPR Therapeutics and ViaCyte, Inc.

==== HIV/AIDS ====
Human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. While effective treatments exist which can allow patients to live healthy lives, HIV is retroactive meaning that it embeds an inactive version of itself in the human genome. CRISPR can be used to selectively remove the virus from the genome by designing guide RNA to target the retroactive HIV genome. One issue with this approach is that it requires the removal of the HIV genome from almost all cells, which can be difficult to realistically achieve.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Infection ====
CRISPR-Cas-based "RNA-guided nucleases" can be used to target [[virulence factors]], genes encoding [[antibiotic resistance]], and other medically relevant sequences of interest. This technology thus represents a novel form of antimicrobial therapy and a strategy by which to manipulate bacterial populations.&lt;ref name="Gomaaetal2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomaa AA, Klumpe HE, Luo ML, Selle K, Barrangou R, Beisel CL | title = Programmable removal of bacterial strains by use of genome-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e00928–e00913 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24473129 | pmc = 3903277 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00928-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CitorikMimee2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Citorik RJ, Mimee M, Lu TK | title = Sequence-specific antimicrobials using efficiently delivered RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 11 | pages = 1141–1145 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25240928 | pmc = 4237163 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3011 | hdl = 1721.1/100834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest a correlation between the interfering of the CRISPR-Cas locus and acquisition of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name="Gholizadeh2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gholizadeh P, Aghazadeh M, Asgharzadeh M, Kafil HS | title = Suppressing the CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system in bacterial infections | journal = European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 11 | pages = 2043–2051 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28601970 | doi = 10.1007/s10096-017-3036-2 | s2cid = 22716314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system provides protection of bacteria against invading foreign DNA, such as [[transposon]]s, [[bacteriophage]]s, and plasmids.

Research suggests that CRISPR is an effective way to limit replication of multiple [[Herpesviridae|herpesviruses]]. It was able to eradicate viral DNA in the case of [[Epstein–Barr virus]] (EBV). Anti-herpesvirus CRISPRs have promising applications such as removing cancer-causing EBV from tumor cells, helping rid donated organs for [[immunocompromised]] patients of viral invaders, or preventing [[Herpes labialis|cold sore]] outbreaks and recurrent eye infections by blocking [[HSV-1]] reactivation. {{as of|2016|August}}, these were awaiting testing.&lt;ref name="pmid27362483"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Diemen FR, Kruse EM, Hooykaas MJ, Bruggeling CE, Schürch AC, van Ham PM, Imhof SM, Nijhuis M, Wiertz EJ, Lebbink RJ | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing of Herpesviruses Limits Productive and Latent Infections | journal = PLOS Pathogens | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = e1005701 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27362483 | pmc = 4928872 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005701 }}

CRISPR may revive the concept of [[Xenotransplantation|transplanting]] animal organs into people. [[Retrovirus]]es present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015, a team eliminated 62 copies of a particular retroviral DNA sequence from the pig genome in a kidney epithelial cell.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"/&gt; Researchers recently demonstrated the ability to birth live pig specimens after removing these retroviruses from their genome using CRISPR for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608579/crispr-opens-up-new-possibilities-for-transplants-using-pig-organs/|title=Using CRISPR on pigs could make their organs safer for human transplant| vauthors = Mullin E |work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dead-Cas9 potential applications.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A dead Cas9 protein coupled with epigenetic modifiers which are used to repress certain genome sequences rather than cutting it all together.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;]]
Using "dead" versions of Cas9 ([[Cas9#Interference of transcription by dCas9|dCas9]]) eliminates CRISPR's DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences.

The targeted site is methylated, [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]] modifying the gene. This modification inhibits transcription. These precisely placed modifications may then be used to regulate the effects on gene expressions and DNA dynamics after the inhibition of certain genome sequences within DNA. Within the past few years, epigenetic marks in different human cells have been closely researched and certain patterns within the marks have been found to correlate with everything ranging from tumor growth to brain activity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez AA, Lim WA, Qi LS | title = Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation | journal = Nature Reviews.

Cas9 was used to carry synthetic [[transcription factor]]s that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.&lt;ref name="craze2" /&gt;

=== RNA editing ===
In 2016, researchers demonstrated that CRISPR from an ordinary mouth bacterium could be used to edit [[RNA]]. The researchers searched databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled CRISPR genes. They considered the fusobacterium ''[[Leptotrichia shahii]]''. It had a group of genes that resembled CRISPR genes, but with important differences. When the researchers equipped other bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a novel defense.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/science/rna-c2c2-gene-editing-dna-crispr.html | title = Scientists Find Form of CRISPR Gene Editing With New Capabilities| vauthors = Zimmer C | date=2016-06-03 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; C2c2 has later been renamed to Cas13a to fit the standard nomenclature for Cas genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pickar-Oliver A, Gersbach CA | title = The next generation of CRISPR-Cas technologies and applications | journal = Nature Reviews.

Many viruses encode their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA that they repurpose to make new viruses. [[HIV]] and [[poliovirus]] are such viruses. Bacteria with Cas13 make molecules that can dismember RNA, destroying the virus. Tailoring these genes opened any RNA molecule to editing.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems can also be employed for editing of [[MicroRNA|micro-RNA]] and [[Long non-coding RNA|long-noncoding RNA]] genes in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Basak J, Nithin C | title = Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge yet Worth Accepting | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 6 | pages = 1001 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26635829 | pmc = 4652605 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2015.01001 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene drive ===
{{Main|Gene drive}}
Gene drives may provide a powerful tool to restore balance of ecosystems by eliminating invasive species. Concerns regarding efficacy, unintended consequences in the target species as well as non-target species have been raised particularly in the potential for accidental release from laboratories into the wild. Scientists have proposed several safeguards for ensuring the containment of experimental gene drives including molecular, reproductive, and ecological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akbari OS, Bellen HJ, Bier E, Bullock SL, Burt A, Church GM, Cook KR, Duchek P, Edwards OR, Esvelt KM, Gantz VM, Golic KG, Gratz SJ, Harrison MM, Hayes KR, James AA, Kaufman TC, Knoblich J, Malik HS, Matthews KA, O'Connor-Giles KM, Parks AL, Perrimon N, Port F, Russell S, Ueda R, Wildonger J | display-authors = 6 | title = BIOSAFETY.

=== ''In vitro'' genetic depletion ===
Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] as seen with [[restriction enzyme]]s. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.&lt;ref name="pmid26944702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu W, Crawford ED, O'Donovan BD, Wilson MR, Chow ED, Retallack H, DeRisi JL | title = Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH): using Cas9 to remove unwanted high-abundance species in sequencing libraries and molecular counting applications | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | pages = 41 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26944702 | pmc = 4778327 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0904-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==
=== Human germline modification ===
As of March 2015, multiple groups had announced ongoing research with the intention of laying the foundations for applying CRISPR to human embryos for [[human germline engineering]], including labs in the US, China, and the UK, as well as US biotechnology company [[OvaScience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Regalado A | journal = MIT Technology Review | date = March 5, 2015 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/ | title = Engineering the Perfect Baby |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313092113/https://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/ |archive-date= March 13, 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists, including a CRISPR co-discoverer, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said "scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans" until the full implications "are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations".&lt;ref name="SCI-20150319"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baltimore D, Berg P, Botchan M, Carroll D, Charo RA, Church G, Corn JE, Daley GQ, Doudna JA, Fenner M, Greely HT, Jinek M, Martin GS, Penhoet E, Puck J, Sternberg SH, Weissman JS, Yamamoto KR | display-authors = 6 | title = Biotechnology.

In April 2015, Chinese scientists reported results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable [[human embryos]] using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes [[beta thalassemia]], a lethal heritable disorder.&lt;ref name="LiangXu2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–372 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25894090 | pmc = 4417674 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150423"&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Kolata G | title=Chinese Scientists Edit Genes of Human Embryos, Raising Concerns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/health/chinese-scientists-edit-genes-of-human-embryos-raising-concerns.html |date=23 April 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study had previously been rejected by both ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in part because of ethical concerns.&lt;ref name=NatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17378 |title=Chinese scientists genetically modify human embryos |journal=Nature |year=2015 | vauthors = Cyranoski D, Reardon S |s2cid=87604469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments resulted in successfully changing only some of the intended genes, and had [[Off-target effects of genome editing|off-target effects]] on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in [[reproductive medicine]].&lt;ref name=NatureNews/&gt; In April 2016, Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR – this time to alter the [[CCR5]] gene to make the embryo resistant to [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601235/chinese-researchers-experiment-with-making-hiv-proof-embryos/|title=Chinese Researchers Experiment with Making HIV-Proof Embryos| vauthors = Regalado A |date=2016-05-08|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, an International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of [[David Baltimore]]. Members of national scientific academies of the US, UK, and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. They agreed to support basic and clinical research under certain legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between [[somatic cell]]s, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, and germline cells, where genome changes can be inherited by descendants. Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene–environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. [[social Darwinism]]). Altering of [[gametocytes]] and embryos to generate heritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible. The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries.&lt;ref name="National Academy of Science"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a | date =3 December 2015 | title = International Summit on Gene Editing | publisher =[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] | access-date = 3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, the [[United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] ([[NASEM]]) Committee on Human Gene Editing published a report reviewing ethical, legal, and scientific concerns of genomic engineering technology. The conclusion of the report stated that heritable [[genome editing]] is impermissible now but could be justified for certain medical conditions; however, they did not justify the usage of [[CRISPR]] for enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brokowski C | title = Do CRISPR Germline Ethics Statements Cut It? | journal = The CRISPR Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–125 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 31021208 | pmc = 6694771 | doi = 10.1089/crispr.2017.0024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, [[He Jiankui|Jiankui He]] announced that he had edited two human embryos to attempt to disable the gene for [[CCR5]], which codes for a receptor that [[HIV]] uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, [[Lulu and Nana controversy|Lulu and Nana]], had been born a few weeks earlier. He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 ([[mosaicism]]) and were still vulnerable to HIV. The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Begley S |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT |date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international group of scientists called for a global moratorium on genetically editing human embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/13/scientists-call-for-global-moratorium-on-crispr-gene-editing|title=Scientists call for global moratorium on gene editing of embryos| vauthors = Sample I |date=13 March 2019|access-date=14 March 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy barriers to genetic engineering ===
Policy regulations for the CRISPR-Cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryo]]s by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaway E | title = UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7588 | pages = 18 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842037 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19270 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2016Natur.530...18C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the [[Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000]] gives the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] the authority to oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment, and economy of the US. The act regulates any [[genetically modified organism]] that utilizes the genome of a predefined "plant pest" or any plant not previously categorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McHughen A, Smyth S | title = US regulatory system for genetically modified [genetically modified organism (GMO), rDNA or transgenic] crop cultivars | journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17956539 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2007.00300.x | s2cid = 3210837 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Yinong Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the [[white button mushroom]] to make them non-browning. Since he had not added any foreign-species ([[transgenic]]) DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated by the USDA under Section 340.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/downloads/reg_loi/15-321-01_air_response_signed.pdf|title=Re: Request to confirm |author=USDA| author-link=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yang's white button mushroom was the first organism genetically modified with the CRISPR-Cas9 protein system to pass US regulation.&lt;ref name="Waltz_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waltz E | title = Gene-edited CRISPR mushroom escapes US regulation | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7599 | pages = 293 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27111611 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19754 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..293W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With the help of the US [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]], special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next five years and any new regulations that might be needed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = Gene-editing surges as US rethinks regulations | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7598 | pages = 158–159 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27075074 | doi = 10.1038/532158a | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..158L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] proposed a rule that would classify genetic engineering modifications to animals as "animal drugs", subjecting them to strict regulation if offered for sale and reducing the ability for individuals and small businesses to make them profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-rogue-genetic-engineers/ | title = The FDA Is Cracking Down On Rogue Genetic Engineers | vauthors = Brown KV | work = Gizmodo | date = 1 February 2017 | access-date = 5 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM113903.pdf |title=Guidance for Industry #187 / Regulation of Intentionally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals |website=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |date=2020-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CRISPR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|p|ər}}) (an acronym for '''clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats''') is a family of [[DNA]] sequences found in the [[genome]]s of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid25574773" /&gt; These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of [[bacteriophage]]s that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of [[acquired immunity]].&lt;ref name="pmid25574773"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | author-link=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = The roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in adaptive immunity and beyond | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 32 | pages = 36–41 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25574773 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2014.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redman M, King A, Watson C, King D | title = What is CRISPR/Cas9? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition | volume = 101 | issue = 4 | pages = 213–215 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27059283 | pmc = 4975809 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2016-310459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17379808"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R, Fremaux C, Deveau H, Richards M, Boyaval P, Moineau S, Romero DA, Horvath P | s2cid=3888761 | author-link1=Rodolphe Barrangou | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5819 | pages = 1709–1712 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17379808 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138140 | bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1709B | hdl=20.500.11794/38902 | hdl-access = free }} {{Registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19095942"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = CRISPR interference limits horizontal gene transfer in staphylococci by targeting DNA | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5909 | pages = 1843–1845 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19095942 | pmc = 2695655 | doi = 10.1126/science.1165771 | bibcode = 2008Sci...322.1843M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced [[bacterial genome]]s and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.&lt;ref name="Hille2018"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hille F, Richter H, Wong SP, Bratovič M, Ressel S, Charpentier E |title=The Biology of CRISPR-Cas: Backward and Forward |journal=Cell |volume=172 |issue=6 |pages=1239–1259 |date=March 2018 |pmid=29522745 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.11.032 |hdl=21.11116/0000-0003-FC0D-4 |s2cid=3777503 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cas9]] (or "CRISPR-associated protein 9") is an [[enzyme]] that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence.

== History ==
=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats took place independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from [[Osaka University]] researcher [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the "''iap" gene'' ''(isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase)'' from the genome of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rawat A, Roy M, Jyoti A, Kaushik S, Verma K, Srivastava VK | title = Cysteine proteases: Battling pathogenic parasitic protozoans with omnipresent enzymes | journal = Microbiological Research | volume = 249 | pages = 126784 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 33989978 | doi = 10.1016/j.micres.2021.126784 | s2cid = 234597200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–5433 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | pmc = 213968 | doi = 10.1128/jb.169.12.5429-5433.1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was their target. The organization of the repeats was unusual. Repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively, without interspersing different sequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt; They did not know the function of the interrupted clustered repeats.

In 1993, researchers of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted [[direct repeat]]s (DR) in that bacterium. They recognized the diversity of the sequences that intervened in the direct repeats among different strains of ''M. tuberculosis''&lt;ref name="Soolingen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Soolingen D, de Haas PE, Hermans PW, Groenen PM, van Embden JD | title = Comparison of various repetitive DNA elements as genetic markers for strain differentiation and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1987–1995 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 7690367 | pmc = 265684 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.31.8.1987-1995.1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used this property to design a typing method that was named ''[[wikt:spoligotyping|spoligotyping]]'', which is still in use, today.&lt;ref name="Groenen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenen PM, Bunschoten AE, van Soolingen D, van Embden JD | title = Nature of DNA polymorphism in the direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; application for strain differentiation by a novel typing method | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 1057–1065 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00976.x | s2cid = 25304723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mojica2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mojica FJ, Montoliu L |title=On the Origin of CRISPR-Cas Technology: From Prokaryotes to Mammals |journal=Trends in Microbiology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=811–820 |year=2016 |pmid=27401123 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2016.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Mojica]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in Spain studied repeats observed in the archaeal organisms of ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species and their function. Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in ''[[Haloferax volcanii]]''. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time; this was the first full characterization of CRISPR.&lt;ref name="Mojica2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mojica2016b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Rodriguez-Valera F |title=The discovery of CRISPR in archaea and bacteria |journal=The FEBS Journal |volume=283 |issue=17 |pages=3162–3169 |year=2016 |pmid=27234458 |doi=10.1111/febs.13766 |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/57676/2/2016_Mojica_Rodriguez_TheFEBSJournal_accepted.pdf |hdl=10045/57676 |s2cid=42827598 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself. They identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family.&lt;ref name="Mojica_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, Soria E, Juez G | title = Biological significance of a family of regularly spaced repeats in the genomes of Archaea, Bacteria and mitochondria | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 244–246 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10760181 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01838.x |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because those sequences were interspaced, Mojica initially called these sequences "short regularly spaced repeats" (SRSR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Isaacson W | author-link1 = Walter Isaacson |title=The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f_D3DwAAQBAJ |page=73 |place=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2021 |isbn=978-1-9821-1585-2 |oclc=1239982737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Mojica and [[Ruud Jansen]], who were searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Mojica2016b" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barrangou R, van der Oost J | author-link1 = Rodolphe Barrangou | title = CRISPR-Cas Systems : RNA-mediated Adaptive Immunity in Bacteria and Archaea | date = 2013 | publisher = Springer | location = Heidelberg  | isbn = 978-3-642-34656-9 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Tang, et al. showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of ''[[Archaeoglobus fulgidus]]'' were transcribed into long RNA molecules that were subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.&lt;ref name="pmid12032318"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang TH, Bachellerie JP, Rozhdestvensky T, Bortolin ML, Huber H, Drungowski M, Elge T, Brosius J, Hüttenhofer A | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of 86 candidates for small non-messenger RNAs from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 11 | pages = 7536–7541 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12032318 | pmc = 124276 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.112047299 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.7536T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25994611"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charpentier E, Richter H, van der Oost J, White MF | title = Biogenesis pathways of RNA guides in archaeal and bacterial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 428–441 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25994611 | pmc = 5965381 | doi = 10.1093/femsre/fuv023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[yogurt]] researcher [[Rodolphe Barrangou]] discovered that ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]'', after iterative phage challenges, develops increased phage resistance, and this enhanced resistance is due to the incorporation of additional CRISPR spacer sequences.&lt;ref name="Romero_2020"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romero DA, Magill D, Millen A, Horvath P, Fremaux C | title = Dairy lactococcal and streptococcal phage-host interactions: an industrial perspective in an evolving phage landscape | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 909–932 | date = November 2020 | pmid = 33016324 | doi = 10.1093/femsre/fuaa048 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish food company Danisco, which at that time Barrangou worked for, then developed phage-resistant ''S. thermophilus'' strains for use in yogurt production. Danisco was later bought out by [[DuPont]], which "owns about 50 percent of the global dairy culture market" and the technology went mainstream.&lt;ref name="rbpont"&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Molteni M, Huckins G |title=The WIRED Guide to Crispr |url=https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-crispr/ |agency=Wired Magazine |publisher=Condé Nast |date=1 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or ''cas'' genes. Four ''cas'' genes (''cas'' 1–4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed [[helicase]] and [[nuclease]] [[Structural motif|motifs]], suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.&lt;ref name="pmid11952905"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen R, Embden JD, Gaastra W, Schouls LM | title = Identification of genes that are associated with DNA repeats in prokaryotes | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1565–1575 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11952905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x | s2cid = 23196085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication, the acronym CRISPR was used as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.

[[File:SimpleCRISPR.jpg|thumb|Simplified diagram of a CRISPR locus. The three major components of a CRISPR locus are shown: ''cas'' genes, a leader sequence, and a repeat-spacer array. Repeats are shown as gray boxes and spacers are colored bars. The arrangement of the three components is not always as shown.&lt;ref name="pmid20056882"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | s2cid=17960960 | author-link2=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–170 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/Science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20125085"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = CRISPR interference: RNA-directed adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–190 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20125085 | pmc = 2928866 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, several CRISPRs with similar sequences can be present in a single genome, only one of which is associated with ''cas'' genes.&lt;ref name="pmid17521438"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grissa I, Vergnaud G, Pourcel C | title = The CRISPRdb database and tools to display CRISPRs and to generate dictionaries of spacers and repeats | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 8 | pages = 172 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17521438 | pmc = 1892036 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-8-172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from [[phage]] DNA and [[extrachromosomal DNA]] such as [[plasmids]].&lt;ref name="pmid15758212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pourcel C, Salvignol G, Vergnaud G | title = CRISPR elements in Yersinia pestis acquire new repeats by preferential uptake of bacteriophage DNA, and provide additional tools for evolutionary studies | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 653–663 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15758212 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.27437-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15791728"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, García-Martínez J, Soria E | s2cid = 27481111 | title = Intervening sequences of regularly spaced prokaryotic repeats derive from foreign genetic elements | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–182 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15791728 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-004-0046-3 | bibcode = 2005JMolE..60..174M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16079334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolotin A, Quinquis B, Sorokin A, Ehrlich SD | title = Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2551–2561 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16079334 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28048-0 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/''cas'' system could have a role in adaptive immunity in [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid20056882" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25963251"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morange M | title = What history tells us XXXVII.

The first publication&lt;ref name="pmid15791728" /&gt; proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by Mojica and collaborators at the [[University of Alicante]], predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the [[RNA interference]] system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.&lt;ref name="Makarova2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makarova KS, Grishin NV, Shabalina SA, Wolf YI, Koonin EV | author-link5=Eugene Koonin | title = A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | pages = 7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16545108 | pmc = 1462988 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published.&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17379808"/&gt; A CRISPR region in ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]'' acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting [[bacteriophage]].

=== Cas9 ===
{{main|Cas9}}
Researchers studied a simpler CRISPR system from ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' that relies on the protein [[Cas9]]. The Cas9 [[endonuclease]] is a four-component system that includes two small molecules: crRNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="Deltcheva2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deltcheva E, Chylinski K, Sharma CM, Gonzales K, Chao Y, Pirzada ZA, Eckert MR, Vogel J, Charpentier E | title = CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7340 | pages = 602–607 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21455174 | pmc = 3070239 | doi = 10.1038/nature09886 | bibcode = 2011Natur.471..602D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrangou2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | author-link=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = Diversity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and molecular machines | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | pages = 247 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26549499 | pmc = 4638107 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-015-0816-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a "single-guide RNA" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA.

Cas12a showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM]] (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9), and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast, Cas9 requires both crRNA and a [[Trans-activating crRNA|transactivating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).

These differences may give Cas12a some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cas12a's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5′ overhangs left by Cas12a can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.&lt;ref name="PMC5316869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim ST, Ryu J, Kang BC, Kim JS, and Kim SG | title = CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 14406 | pages = 14406 | date = February 2017 | pmc = 5316869 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14406 | pmid=28205546| bibcode = 2017NatCo...814406K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cas12a cleaves DNA 18–23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cas12a enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in [[indel]] mutations that destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cpf1 Nuclease|url = https://www.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/CRISPR_Cas9_Introduction_Part7.php#ATSPC|website = abmgood.com|access-date = 2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctive feature of Cas12a, as compared to Cas9, is that after cutting its target, Cas12a remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssDNA molecules non-discriminately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JS, Ma E, Harrington LB, Da Costa M, Tian X, Palefsky JM, Doudna JA | title = CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6387 | pages = 436–439 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29449511 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar6245 | pmc = 6628903 | bibcode = 2018Sci...360..436C | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is called "collateral cleavage" or "trans-cleavage" activity and has been exploited for the development of various diagnostic technologies.&lt;ref name="CRISPR-Cas12-based detection of SAR"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Broughton JP, Deng X, Yu G, Fasching CL, Servellita V, Singh J, Miao X, Streithorst JA, Granados A, Sotomayor-Gonzalez A, Zorn K, Gopez A, Hsu E, Gu W, Miller S, Pan CY, Guevara H, Wadford DA, Chen JS, Chiu CY | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR-Cas12-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–874 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32300245 | doi = 10.1038/s41587-020-0513-4 | pmc = 9107629 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enhancement of trans-cleavage activ"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen LT, Smith BM, Jain PK | title = Enhancement of trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a with engineered crRNA enables amplified nucleic acid detection | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 4906 | date = September 2020 | pmid = 32999292 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-020-18615-1 | pmc = 7528031 | bibcode = 2020NatCo..11.4906N | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas13 ===
In 2016, the nuclease {{visible anchor|Cas13a}} (formerly known as {{visible anchor|C2c2}}) from the bacterium ''Leptotrichia shahii'' was characterized. Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease, which means that it does not cleave DNA, but only single-stranded RNA. Cas13 is guided by its crRNA to a ssRNA target and binds and cleaves the target. Similar to Cas12a, the Cas13 remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssRNA molecules non-discriminately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abudayyeh OO, Gootenberg JS, Konermann S, Joung J, Slaymaker IM, Cox DB, Shmakov S, Makarova KS, Semenova E, Minakhin L, Severinov K, Regev A, Lander ES, Koonin EV, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = C2c2 is a single-component programmable RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR effector | journal = Science | volume = 353 | issue = 6299 | pages = aaf5573 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27256883 | pmc = 5127784 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaf5573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This collateral cleavage property has been exploited for the development of various diagnostic technologies.&lt;ref name="Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Lee JW, Essletzbichler P, Dy AJ, Joung J, Verdine V, Donghia N, Daringer NM, Freije CA, Myhrvold C, Bhattacharyya RP, Livny J, Regev A, Koonin EV, Hung DT, Sabeti PC, Collins JJ, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2 | journal = Science | volume = 356 | issue = 6336 | pages = 438–442 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28408723 | pmc = 5526198 | doi = 10.1126/science.aam9321 | bibcode = 2017Sci...356..438G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Kellner MJ, Joung J, Collins JJ, Zhang F | title = Multiplexed and portable nucleic acid detection platform with Cas13, Cas12a, and Csm6 | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6387 | pages = 439–444 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29449508 | pmc = 5961727 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaq0179 | bibcode = 2018Sci...360..439G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPRINT: a Cas13a-based platform for"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwasaki RS, Batey RT | title = SPRINT: a Cas13a-based platform for detection of small molecules | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 48 | issue = 17 | pages = e101 | date = September 2020 | pmid = 32797156 | pmc = 7515716 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkaa673 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, Dr. Hui Yang characterized novel miniature Cas13 protein (mCas13) variants, Cas13X &amp; Cas13Y. Using a small portion of N gene sequence from SARS-CoV-2 as a target in characterization of mCas13, revealed the sensitivity and specificity of mCas13 coupled with RT-LAMP for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in both synthetic and clinical samples over other available standard tests like RT-qPCR (1 copy/μL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahas A, Wang Q, Marsic T, Mahfouz MM | title = A Novel Miniature CRISPR-Cas13 System for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics | journal = ACS Synthetic Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 2541–2551 | date = October 2021 | pmid = 34546709 | pmc = 8482783 | doi = 10.1021/acssynbio.1c00181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===
Small clusters of ''cas'' genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 ''cas'' genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the ''cas'' core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the ''cas'' core.&lt;!-- Okay, the numbers are from Makarova2015, and the Makarova2018 source has expanded them a bit. Its fig1 mentions 13 core gene families (instead of 11), but there's no mention of total gene families nor total gene count. --&gt;&lt;ref name="Makarova2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Makarova KS | title = Origins and evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI.&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright AV, Nuñez JK, Doudna JA | author-link3=Jennifer Doudna | title = Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 29–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26771484 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.035 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes.&lt;ref name="Westra2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westra ER, Dowling AJ, Broniewski JM, van Houte S | title = Evolution and Ecology of CRISPR | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date = November 2016 | volume = 47 | issue = 1 |pages = 307–331 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032428 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a "signature gene" found almost exclusively in the category.

[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|The stages of CRISPR immunity for each of the three major types of adaptive immunity.&lt;br /&gt; (1) Acquisition begins by recognition of invading DNA by [[Cas1]] and Cas2 and cleavage of a protospacer.&lt;br /&gt; (2) The protospacer is ligated to the direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence and &lt;br /&gt;(3) single strand extension repairs the CRISPR and duplicates the direct repeat. The crRNA processing and interference stages occur differently in each of the three major CRISPR systems.&lt;br /&gt; (4) The primary CRISPR transcript is cleaved by cas genes to produce crRNAs.&lt;br /&gt; (5) In type I systems Cas6e/Cas6f cleave at the junction of ssRNA and dsRNA formed by hairpin loops in the direct repeat. Type II systems use a trans-activating (tracr) RNA to form dsRNA, which is cleaved by [[Cas9]] and RNaseIII. Type III systems use a Cas6 homolog that does not require hairpin loops in the direct repeat for cleavage.&lt;br /&gt; (6) In type II and type III systems secondary trimming is performed at either the 5’ or 3’ end to produce mature crRNAs.&lt;br /&gt; (7) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form interference complexes.&lt;br /&gt; (8) In type I and type II systems, interactions between the protein and PAM sequence are required for degradation of invading DNA. Type III systems do not require a PAM for successful degradation and in type III-A systems basepairing occurs between the crRNA and mRNA rather than the DNA, targeted by type III-B systems.]]

=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a [[microbe]] is invaded by a [[bacteriophage]], the first stage of the immune response is to capture phage DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. [[Cas1]] and [[Cas2]] are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of [[cas1]] or [[cas2]] stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid19120484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aliyari R, Ding SW | title = RNA-based viral immunity initiated by the Dicer family of host immune receptors | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 227 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–188 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19120484 | pmc = 2676720 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23696746"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dugar G, Herbig A, Förstner KU, Heidrich N, Reinhardt R, Nieselt K, Sharma CM | title = High-resolution transcriptome maps reveal strain-specific regulatory features of multiple Campylobacter jejuni isolates | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1003495 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23696746 | pmc = 3656092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22160698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatoum-Aslan A, Maniv I, Marraffini LA | title = Mature clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats RNA (crRNA) length is measured by a ruler mechanism anchored at the precursor processing site | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 52 | pages = 21218–21222 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22160698 | pmc = 3248500 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112832108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10821218H | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22402487"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yosef I, Goren MG, Qimron U | title = Proteins and DNA elements essential for the CRISPR adaptation process in ''Escherichia coli'' | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 5569–5576 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22402487 | pmc = 3384332 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarts DC, Mosterd C, van Passel MW, Brouns SJ | title = CRISPR interference directs strand specific spacer acquisition | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35888 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22558257 | pmc = 3338789 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035888 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735888S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.&lt;ref name="pmid23403393" /&gt; It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.

==== Insertion variants ====
Analysis of ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid22834906" /&gt;

Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of ''E. coli''. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22771574" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt; This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt;

=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array.&lt;ref name="pmid20125085" /&gt; This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs. The mechanism to produce crRNAs differs among CRISPR/Cas systems. In type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops&lt;ref name="pmid21572444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gesner EM, Schellenberg MJ, Garside EL, George MM, Macmillan AM | s2cid = 677704 | title = Recognition and maturation of effector RNAs in a CRISPR interference pathway | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 688–692 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572444 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21572442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sashital DG, Jinek M, Doudna JA | s2cid=5538195 | author-link3=Jennifer Doudna | title = An RNA-induced conformational change required for CRISPR RNA cleavage by the endoribonuclease Cse3 | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 680–687 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572442 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20829488"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haurwitz RE, Jinek M, Wiedenheft B, Zhou K, Doudna JA | author-link5=Jennifer Doudna | title = Sequence- and structure-specific RNA processing by a CRISPR endonuclease | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5997 | pages = 1355–1358 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20829488 | pmc = 3133607 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192272 | bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1355H }}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the pairing of identical repeats that flank the crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunin V, Sorek R, Hugenholtz P | title = Evolutionary conservation of sequence and secondary structures in CRISPR repeats | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R61 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17442114 | pmc = 1896005 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Cas proteins cleave the longer transcript at the edge of the paired region, leaving a single crRNA along with a small remnant of the paired repeat region.

Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a [[trans-activating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="Deltcheva2011"/&gt; Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems, the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt;

CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.&lt;ref name="pmid19095942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garneau2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19120484" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21646539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Semenova E, Jore MM, Datsenko KA, Semenova A, Westra ER, Wanner B, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ, Severinov K | display-authors = 6 | title = Interference by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA is governed by a seed sequence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 25 | pages = 10098–10103 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21646539 | pmc = 3121866 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1104144108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10810098S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21166892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gudbergsdottir S, Deng L, Chen Z, Jensen JV, Jensen LR, She Q, Garrett RA | title = Dynamic properties of the Sulfolobus CRISPR/Cas and CRISPR/Cmr systems when challenged with vector-borne viral and plasmid genes and protospacers | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–49 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21166892 | pmc = 3025118 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07452.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21385233"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manica A, Zebec Z, Teichmann D, Schleper C | title = In vivo activity of CRISPR-mediated virus defence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 481–491 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21385233 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07586.x | s2cid = 41442419 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid21460843"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jore MM, Lundgren M, van Duijn E, Bultema JB, Westra ER, Waghmare SP, Wiedenheft B, Pul U, Wurm R, Wagner R, Beijer MR, Barendregt A, Zhou K, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Doudna JA, Boekema EJ, Heck AJ, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ | author-link16=Jennifer Doudna | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis for CRISPR RNA-guided DNA recognition by Cascade | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 529–536 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21460843 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2019 | s2cid=10987554 | url=https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/6761943/2011NatStructMolBiolJoreSupp.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21938068"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedenheft B, Lander GC, Zhou K, Jore MM, Brouns SJ, van der Oost J, Doudna JA, Nogales E | author-link7=Jennifer Doudna | title = Structures of the RNA-guided surveillance complex from a bacterial immune system | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7365 | pages = 486–489 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21938068 | doi = 10.1038/nature10402 | bibcode = 2011Natur.477..486W | pmc=4165517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems, the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits [[Cas3]] for DNA degradation.

Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, [[Cas9]], for the interference step.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt; [[Cas9]] requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleave DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).

Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid22227115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Rouillon C, Kerou M, Reeks J, Brugger K, Graham S, Reimann J, Cannone G, Liu H, Albers SV, Naismith JH, Spagnolo L, White MF | title = Structure and mechanism of the CMR complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–313 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22227115 | pmc = 3381847 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale CR, Zhao P, Olson S, Duff MO, Graveley BR, Wells L, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–956 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19945378 | pmc = 2951265 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type III systems analysed from ''S. solfataricus'' and ''P. furiosus'' both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome,&lt;ref name="pmid23320564" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378" /&gt; which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.&lt;ref name="pmid22337052" /&gt; Type III systems were also found to target DNA in addition to RNA using a different Cas protein in the complex, Cas10.&lt;ref name="Estrella 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Estrella MA, Kuo FT, Bailey S| doi = 10.1101/gad.273722.115| title =RNA-activated DNA cleavage by the Type III-B CRISPR–Cas effector complex| journal = [[Genes &amp; Development]] | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 460–470 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26848046| pmc = 4762430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA cleavage was shown to be transcription dependent.&lt;ref name="Samai 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Samai P, Pyenson N, Jiang W, Goldberg GW, Hatoum-Aslan A, Marraffini LA|author2-link=Nicholas Pyenson| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.027| title =Co-transcriptional DNA and RNA Cleavage during Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity| journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 5 | pages = 1164–1174 | year = 2015 | pmid =25959775| pmc = 4594840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = Self versus non-self discrimination during CRISPR RNA-directed immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7280 | pages = 568–571 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20072129 | pmc = 2813891 | doi = 10.1038/nature08703 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..568M }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as [[Restriction enzyme#Type V|type V restriction enzymes]].

The cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules.

CRISPR/Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission.

=== Coevolution ===

CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, ''[[Francisella novicida]]'' uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial [[lipoprotein]] that is critical for ''F. novicida'' to dampen host response and promote virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampson TR, Saroj SD, Llewellyn AC, Tzeng YL, Weiss DS | title = A CRISPR/Cas system mediates bacterial innate immune evasion and virulence | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7448 | pages = 254–257 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23584588 | pmc = 3651764 | doi = 10.1038/nature12048 | bibcode = 2013Natur.497..254S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To resist a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts' given point mutations in the spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt; Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.&lt;ref name="pmid18065545" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt;

=== Rates ===
A study of 124 ''S. thermophilus'' strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt; Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A [[Comparative genomics|comparative genomic]] analysis showed that ''E. coli'' and ''[[Salmonella enterica|S. enterica]]'' evolve much more slowly than ''S. thermophilus''. The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.&lt;ref name="pmid20559554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touchon M, Rocha EP | title = The small, slow and specialized CRISPR and anti-CRISPR of Escherichia and Salmonella | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11126 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20559554 | pmc = 2886076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011126 | veditors = Randau L | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511126T | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[metagenomics|Metagenomic]] analysis of two acid-mine-drainage [[biofilm]]s showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other.&lt;ref name="pmid17894817" /&gt; In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7–22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;

From the same environment, a single strain was tracked using [[PCR]] primers specific to its CRISPR system. Broad-level results of spacer presence/absence showed significant diversity. However, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt; suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.

CRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the [[human microbiome project]].&lt;ref name="pmid22719260"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y | title = Diverse CRISPRs evolving in human microbiomes | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002441 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719260 | pmc = 3374615 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these loci originated from [[streptococcal]] species and contained ≈15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt;

CRISPR evolution was studied in [[chemostat]]s using ''S. thermophilus'' to directly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, ''S. thermophilus'' strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun CL, Barrangou R, Thomas BC, Horvath P, Fremaux C, Banfield JF | author-link2=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = Phage mutations in response to CRISPR diversification in a bacterial population | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 463–470 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23057534 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02879.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same interval, the phage developed [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534" /&gt;

Another ''S. thermophilus'' experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.&lt;ref name="pmid24586036"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuno S, Sako Y, Yoshida T | title = Diversification of CRISPR within coexisting genotypes in a natural population of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa | journal = Microbiology | volume = 160 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 903–916 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24586036 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.073494-0 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.

== Identification ==
CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea&lt;ref name="pmid24728998" /&gt; and show some sequence similarities.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114" /&gt; Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeats decreases the likelihood of a false positive match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sorek R, Kunin V, Hugenholtz P | title = CRISPR—a widespread system that provides acquired resistance against phages in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature Reviews.

Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22583485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pride DT, Salzman J, Relman DA | title = Comparisons of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and viromes in human saliva reveal bacterial adaptations to salivary viruses | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 2564–2576 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22583485 | pmc = 3424356 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02775.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23701169"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Whitaker RJ | title = Reassortment of CRISPR repeat-spacer loci in Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 3065–3076 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23701169 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20927396"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Cadillo-Quiroz H, Whitaker RJ | title = CRISPR associated diversity within a population of Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e12988 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20927396 | pmc = 2946923 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012988 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...512988H | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid31729390"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Medvedeva S, Liu Y, Koonin EV, Severinov K, Prangishvili D, Krupovic M | title = Virus-borne mini-CRISPR arrays are involved in interviral conflicts | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 5204 | date = November 2019 | pmid = 31729390 | pmc = 6858448 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-019-13205-2 | bibcode = 2019NatCo..10.5204M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) primers. Degenerate repeat-specific primers can be used to amplify CRISPR spacers directly from environmental samples; amplicons containing two or three spacers can be then computationally assembled to reconstruct long CRISPR arrays.&lt;ref name="pmid31729390" /&gt;

The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely ''de novo'' identification&lt;ref name="pmid23511966"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skennerton CT, Imelfort M, Tyson GW | title = Crass: identification and reconstruction of CRISPR from unassembled metagenomic data | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = e105 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23511966 | pmc = 3664793 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from [[contig]]s (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt; and direct repeat sequences from published genomes&lt;ref name="pmid22732228"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stern A, Mick E, Tirosh I, Sagy O, Sorek R | title = CRISPR targeting reveals a reservoir of common phages associated with the human gut microbiome | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 1985–1994 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22732228 | pmc = 3460193 | doi = 10.1101/gr.138297.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.

== Use by phages ==
Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having [[genomic island|chromosomal islands]]. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.&lt;ref name="pmid20634809"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novick RP, Christie GE, Penadés JR | title = The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 541–551 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20634809 | pmc = 3522866 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PICIs are induced, excised, replicated, and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages. PICIs use several mechanisms to block phage reproduction. In the first mechanism, PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocking phage TerS/TerL complex  formation responsible for phage DNA packaging. In the second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirects the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and phage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsids and hence become nonviable phage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Kumar K, Ross HF, Ubeda C, Damle PK, Lane KD, Penadés JR, Christie GE, Novick RP|date=October 2012|title=Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=40|pages=16300–16305|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204615109|pmc=3479557|pmid=22991467|bibcode=2012PNAS..10916300R|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins. This interference mechanism is modulated by a modulatory protein, PtiM, binds to one of the interference-mediating proteins, PtiA, and hence achieves the required level of interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Ross HF, Novick RP|date=October 2014|title=Precisely modulated pathogenicity island interference with late phage gene transcription|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=40|pages=14536–14541|doi=10.1073/pnas.1406749111|pmc=4209980|pmid=25246539|bibcode=2014PNAS..11114536R|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[serogroup]] O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a ''V. cholera'' PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the I-F system found in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="pmid23446421"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seed KD, Lazinski DW, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = A bacteriophage encodes its own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to evade host innate immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438 | pages = 489–491 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23446421 | pmc = 3587790 | doi = 10.1038/nature11927 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..489S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyd CM, Angermeyer A, Hays SG, Barth ZK, Patel KM, Seed KD | title = Bacteriophage ICP1: A Persistent Predator of ''Vibrio cholerae'' | journal = Annual Review of Virology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 285–304 | date = September 2021 | pmid = 34314595 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-virology-091919-072020 | pmc = 9040626 |issn=2327-056X | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain archaeal viruses were shown to carry mini-CRISPR arrays containing one or two spacers. It has been shown that spacers within the virus-borne CRISPR arrays target other viruses and plasmids, suggesting that mini-CRISPR arrays represent a mechanism of heterotypic superinfection exclusion and participate in interviral conflicts.&lt;ref name="pmid31729390" /&gt;

'''CRISPR-Display ('''CRISP-Disp''')''' is a modification of the [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system for genome editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to direct a ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' [[Cas9]] nuclease, acting as a programmable DNA binding protein, to cleave DNA at a site of interest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinek|first=Martin|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Fonfara|first3=Ines|last4=Hauer|first4=Michael|last5=Doudna|first5=Jennifer A.|last6=Charpentier|first6=Emmanuelle|date=2012-08-17|title=A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity|journal=Science|volume=337|issue=6096|pages=816–821|doi=10.1126/science.1225829|issn=1095-9203|pmid=22745249|pmc=6286148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cong|first=Le|last2=Ran|first2=F.

CRISPR-Display, in contrast, uses a nuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and an engineered sgRNA with aptameric accessory RNA domains, ranging from 100bp to 5kb, outside of the normal complementary targeting sequence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shechner|first=David M.|last2=Hacisuleyman|first2=Ezgi|last3=Younger|first3=Scott T.|last4=Rinn|first4=John L.|date=2015-07-01|title=Multiplexable, locus-specific targeting of long RNAs with CRISPR-Display|journal=Nature Methods|volume=12|issue=7|pages=664–670|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3433|issn=1548-7105|pmc=4821475|pmid=26030444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessory RNA domains can be functional domains, such as long non-coding RNAs ([[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]]), protein-binding motifs, or epitope tags for immunochemistry. This allows for investigation of the functionality of certain lncRNAs, and targeting of [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.

CRISPR-Display was first published in Nature Methods in July 2015, and developed by David M. Shechner, Ezgi Hacisuleyman, Scott T. Younger and John Rinn at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), USA.

== Background ==
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on an adaptive immune system of prokaryotic organisms, and its use for genome editing was first proposed and developed in collaboration between [[Jennifer Doudna]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology]], Germany).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method, and its application in editing human cells, was published in Science on August 17, 2012. In January 2013, the [[Feng Zhang]] lab at the [[Broad Institute]] at MIT published another method in Science, having further optimized the sgRNA structure and expression for use in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the beginning of 2014, almost 2500 studies mentioning CRISPR in their title has been published.

[[Non-coding RNA]]s (ncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are not translated into a protein product, but instead exert their function as RNA molecules. They are involved in a range of processes, like [[post-transcriptional regulation]] of gene expression, [[genomic imprinting]], and regulating the chromatin state, and thereby the expression, of a given locus. Many ncRNAs have been discovered, but in many cases, their function has yet to be accurately dissected due to technical challenges. ncRNA function is often not affected by introducing point mutations and premature stop codons. ncRNAs are also thought to regulate gene expression, so deletion studies have a hard time distinguishing effects of ncRNA loss from effects of gene misregulation due to the deletion. Studies of ncRNAs have also lacked the throughput necessary for discerning the RNA based functionality. To meet these challenges, the Rinn lab therefore developed a synthetic biology approach, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, with the Cas9 acting as a conduit, to target ncRNA modules to ectopic genomic locations, and investigating the ncRNAs effects on reporter genes and other genomic features at that site.

== Method development ==
CRISPR-Disp modifies the CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using a catalytically inactive, i.e. nuclease deficient, Cas9 mutant (dCas9), and altering the RNA used for targeting Cas9 to a genomic location.

Since sgRNAs are usually expressed by [[RNA polymerase III]], which limits the length of the RNA domain that can be inserted, CRISPR-Display incorporates [[RNA polymerase II]] to permit expression of longer transcripts (~80–250 nucleotides) to overcome this limitation. CRISPR-Display can therefore add larger RNA domains, like natural and lncRNA domains, without affecting dCas9 localization.

The sgRNA is engineered with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in the sequence outside of the targeting sequence. In the development of the technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5’ and 3’ end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a [[Viral vector|lentiviral vector]].
[[File:Transcription activator assay.png|thumb|'''Transcription activator assay''' used to verify sgRNA/Cas9 complex targeting activity, and the proper integrity of the added RNA module. Direct activation: The transcription activator, VP64, is fused to the Cas9 protein, so proper targeting of the complex results in reporter gene activation. Bridged activation: VP64 is fused to PP7, which recognizes and binds a sequence in the RNA module when the RNA module is properly folded.]]
To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of [[luciferase]] and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a '''transcription activator assay''' was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) '''(Direct activation)''' or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA '''(Bridged activation)'''. Reporter gene activation through direct activation imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed direct activation except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci.

The effect of internal (stem-loop) insertion size on dCas9 complex was assessed using INT-like constructs with cassettes of PP7 stem loops with a size range from 25 nt to 247 nt. Each construct induced significant activation in the reporter assays signifying that internal insertion size does not influence the dCas9 complex function. Similarly, the effect of internal insert sequence was also determined through a set of unique sgRNA variants displaying cassettes of 25 random nucleotides. Reporter assays and RIP-Seq confirmed that sequence does not govern complex efficacy.

The utility of CRISP-Disp was explored with an array of functional RNA domains such as natural protein binding motifs, artificial aptamers and small molecules with varying size. While all the complexes were functional and viable, and successfully deployed the RNA domains at endogenous loci, the efficacy changed with length and expression levels. This suggests that optimization of structure and sequence might be important required before designing the construct.

To determine if artificial lncRNA scaffolds can be used with CRISPR-Display, dCas9 complexes were assembled with artificial RNA with a size comparable to lncRNAs. The constructs were expanded to ~650nt size with an additional P4-P6 domain with hairpin loops that can be recognized by another phage coat protein, MS2. These topology constructs were called double TOP0-2 with the two domains either together at 5’ or 3’end or separately at each end. Transient reporter assays followed by confirmation with [[Immunoprecipitation|RNA Immunoprecipitation]] sequencing (RIP-qPCR) showed that all the three constructs retained both the domains in the complex.

This was also tested with natural lncRNA domains by building Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90–4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), ''Xist'' A-repeat (RepA), and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator ''[[HOTTIP]]''. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic location of interest by using the CRISP-Disp system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thus, CRISP-Disp enables control of gene expression with deployment of both artificial scaffolds as well as natural lncRNA domains.

== Applications ==
CRISPR-Display allows for previously unavailable studies of lncRNA functionality, artificial ncRNA functionalization, recruitment of endogenous and engineered proteins to genomic loci, and locus affinity tagging for cell imaging. 
[[File:CRISPR-Display_applications.png|thumb|CRISPR-Display allows addition of RNA modules to the sgRNA for a range of functionalities, such as ectopic lncRNA localization, recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation, or affinity tagging for live cell imaging. The functions can be performed simultaneous in the same cell.]]

=== lncRNA domain localization ===
CRISPR-Display allows targeted localization of natural lncRNAs to ectopic sites for investigation of their function. Exposing various ectopic DNA loci to natural lncRNAs can help show the effects of lncRNAs on gene expression and chromatin state, and help dissect the mechanism of such effects. One of the major outstanding questions in the study of lncRNAs is whether effects on chromatin state or gene expression adjacent to a lncRNA locus is due to functional, sequence-specific mechanisms of the lncRNA itself, or due simply to the act of transcribing the lncRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Pinera|first=Pablo|last2=Jones|first2=Matthew F.|last3=Lal|first3=Ashish|last4=Lu|first4=Timothy K.|date=2015-07-16|title=Putting Non-coding RNA on Display with CRISPR|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=59|issue=2|pages=146–148|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.002|issn=1097-4164|pmid=26186289|pmc=6314022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melé|first=Marta|last2=Rinn|first2=John L.|date=2016-06-02|title="Cat's Cradling" the 3D Genome by the Act of LncRNA Transcription|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=5|pages=657–664|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.05.011|issn=1097-4164|pmid=27259198|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Localizing lncRNA to ectopic sites with CRISPR-Display can help separate the function of the RNA itself from the effects of transcribing such RNA species. Before CRISPR-Display, such studies were challenging due to low throughput, and inability to distinguish lncRNA function from other confounding factors like cryptically encoded peptides or functional DNA elements.

=== Artificial ncRNA functionalization ===
CRISPR-Display also allows for targeted use of the wide array of artificial RNAs with specific functionality, such as RNAs for recruitment of endogenous RNA-binding proteins, antibody affinity tagging, and recruitment of tagged fusion proteins.

==== Affinity tagging for live cell imaging ====
One example of artificial ncRNA functionalization is incorporating RNA domains recognized by specific antibodies to the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can target the sgRNA with a particular epitope sequence to various loci, and fluorescently tagged antibodies can be used to image the locus, showing its localization in the nucleus, and possible interactions with other tagged proteins or genomic loci.

==== Recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation ====
Endogenous proteins known to bind a specific RNA motif can be recruited to ectopic genomic locations by incorporating the RNA motif into the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can also recruit fusion proteins engineered to bind specific RNA sequences. Recruiting these proteins can allow studies of specific proteins’ and protein complexes’ effects on gene regulation and chromatin states, as well as specific regulation of certain genes for investigation of gene function.

=== Multiplexed functional studies ===
Due to the modularity of the sgRNA, several different sgRNAs with distinct functional modules can be expressed in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging the effects of the regulation at another location.

The possible applications of CRISPR-Display will continue to increase with further development and understanding of ncRNA functionalization. It is not unreasonable to think that CRISPR-Display may one day enable complex synthetic biology systems, with distinct temporal expression of sgRNAs, and networks and circuits of gene regulation by targeting of regulatory proteins.

== Advantages ==
* Can easily accommodate large RNA cargo (up to ~4.8kb, possibly even larger) within the sgRNA core. Therefore, structured RNA domains, natural long lncRNAs, artificial RNA modules and pools of random sequences can be used with dCas9.
* sgRNA-dCas9 complexation is not limited by sequence composition of the RNA cargo, but seems independent of the RNA modules used.
* CRISPR-Display is a modular method, which allows different functions to be simultaneously performed at diverse loci in the same cell. Using a single construct with orthogonal RNA binding proteins where each protein is fused to a unique functional domain and targeted by sgRNA containing its related RNA motif. (multiplexing) (already included in the applications)
* RNA modules can be added at different locations within the sgRNA sequence (internally, or at the 5’ or 3’ ends), so the location of the RNA module can be optimized or best function.
* Allows construction of Cas9 complexes with protein binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences as well as natural lncRNAs.

== Limitations ==
* CRISPR-Display is currently limited by the number of available functional RNA motifs and RNA binding protein functions. As more such motifs and proteins are discovered and developed, further applications of CRISPR-Display may become possible.
* dCas9 complexation decreases with increasing sgRNA-lncRNA length. The quantitative yields of intact lncRNA domains are, however, recovered relative to the respective sgRNA. Therefore, construct integrity can depend on factors like length and RNA structure.
* Design of a high efficiency CRISPR-Display construct may require some structural or sequence optimization, which can lead to variable construct efficacy.

      <text bytes="1904" xml:space="preserve">'''Critical distance''' for an animal is the distance a human or an aggressor animal has to approach in order to trigger a defensive attack of the first animal.

The concept was introduced by Swiss zoologist [[Heini Hediger]] in 1954, along with other space boundaries for an animal, such as [[flight distance]] (run boundary), '''critical distance''' (attack boundary), [[personal space]] (distance separating members of non-contact species, as a pair of swans), and [[social distance]] (intraspecies communication distance).&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Edward T. (1966). ''The Hidden Dimension''. New York: Anchor Books. ASIN B0006BNQW2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Hediger developed and applied these distance concepts in the context of designing [[zoo]]s.

As the critical distance is smaller than the flight distance, there are only a few scenarios in the wild when the critical distance may be encroached. As an example, critical distance may be reached if an animal noticed an intruder too late or the animal was "cornered" to a place of no escape.&lt;ref name="ZumpeMichael2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doris Zumpe|author2=Richard Phillip Michael|title=Notes on the elements of behavioral science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDt4J0wrTEMC&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46577-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward T. Hall]], a cultural anthropologist, reasoned that in humans the flight distance and critical distance have been eliminated in human reactions, and thus proceeded to determine modified criteria for space boundaries in human interactions.{{by whom|date=April 2015}}

Taking into account the definition of a [[crown group]], '''crown eukaryotes''' could be seen as the aggrupation of all lineages descending from [[Last eukaryotic common ancestor|'''LECA''']] (Last Eukarytotic Common Ancestor). This comprises a huge ensemble of taxa that seemingly diverged simultaneously and that conform the vast majority of the eukaryotic life, plants, fungi, animals and the variety of protist lineages. According to [[ribosomal RNA]] data, the radiation of eukaryotes from LECA would have originated from a series of basal lineages that branched off successively at this early stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Van de Peer Y, Baldaufrid SL, Doolittle WF, Meyerid A|date=December 2000|title=An Updated and Comprehensive rRNA Phylogeny of (Crown) Eukaryotes Based on Rate-Calibrated Evolutionary Distances|journal=J Mol Evol|volume=51|issue=6|pages=565–76|doi=10.1007/s002390010120|pmid=11116330|bibcode=2000JMolE..51..565V|s2cid=9400485|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-35255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hallmark of these organisms pertaining to crown eukaryotes is a higher complexity of their genetic and cellular machinery as compared with [[prokaryote]]s, enabled by their [[Eukaryote|cellular compartmentalization]]. This complexity is accompanied by others extra cell-morphological features: [[Endocytosis|endo]]/[[exocytosis]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[multicellularity]], and vertical inheritance (as opposed to the [[horizontal gene transfer]] common among prokaryotes), that have led to the current morphological, behavioral and macroecological complexity of eukaryotes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Butterfield NJ|date=2015|title=Early evolution of the Eukaryota|journal=Palaeontology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=5–17|doi=10.1111/pala.12139|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If regarded as a crown group, the different lineages of eukaryotic organisms could be traced back until a [[most recent common ancestor]], here LECA. However, the determination of when and how the first crown-group eukaryotes arose remains as one of the main questions of [[evolutionary biology]]. LECA seems to lie between [[Excavata]] and Neozoa. However, the origin of eukaryotes can be traced back to stages prior to the formation of LECA. The current scientific consensus agrees that eukaryotic organisms originated from within the [[Archaea]], in particular, from clades close to [[TACK|TACK archaea]] ([[Nitrososphaerota|Thaumarchaeota]], [[Aigarchaeota]], [[Thermoproteota|Crenarchaeota]], and [[Korarchaeota]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dacks JB, Field MC, Buick R, Eme L, Gribaldo S, Roger AJ, Brochier-Armanet C, Devos DP|date=2016|title=The changing view of eukaryogenesis—fossils, cells, lineages and how they all come together|journal=J Cell Sci|volume=129|issue=20|pages=3695–703|doi=10.1242/jcs.178566|pmid=27672020|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, if Eukarya descend from Archaea, this last group becomes [[paraphyletic]] and offers the possible identification of '''FECA''' (First Eukaryotic Common Ancestor),i.e. the oldest branching point at which the eukaryote lineage and its closest extant relatives separated. Therefore, the evolutionary process that led to the origin of the crown-group eukaryotes ([[eukaryogenesis]]) would consist in the transition from FECA to LECA via the acquisition of the eukaryotic traits.

When dealing with this process, '''stem eukaryotic groups''' must be differentiated from proper '''crown eukaryotic groups'''. Stem eukaryotic groups would have appeared during the long process of acquisition of the eukaryotic traits but went extinct. The problematic then arises for the identification of the first, given that [[taphonomic loss]] and inaccuracy of [[molecular clock]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Eme L, Sharpe SC, Brown MW, Roger AJ|date=2014|title=On the Age of Eukaryotes: Evaluating Evidence from Fossils and Molecular Clocks|journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol|volume=6|issue=8|pages=a016139|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a016139|pmid=25085908|pmc=4107988}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to huge phylogenetic gap comprising the intermediate states that would conform the stem eukaryotes.

Notwithstanding, ideas can be postulated regarding the eukaryotic organism formation based on the traits found in archaeal and [[Alphaproteobacteria|α-proteobacteria]] common to eukaryotes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This consists mostly in homologues of eukaryotic molecular features, specially those related with [[cytoskeleton]], [[cytokine]]s and membrane remodeling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Makarova KS, Yutin N, Bell SD, Koonin EV|date=October 2010|title=Evolution of diverse cell division and vesicle formation systems in Archaea|journal=Nat Rev Microbiol|volume=8|issue=10|pages=731–741|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2406|pmid=20818414|pmc=3293450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, these features are more abundant in the TACK Archaea. This suggests that the [[Endosymbiont hypothesis|acquisition of mitochondria]] was not the onset event, but that rather there had been prior to that an important acquisition of rudimentary eukaryotic traits in the early eukaryotic stem groups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Koonin EV|date=March 2005|title=The incredible expanding ancestor of eukaryotes|url= |journal=Cell|volume=140|issue=5|pages=606–608|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.022|pmid=20211127|pmc=3293451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Martijn J, ((Ettema TJG))|date=February 2013|title=From archaeon to eukaryote: the evolutionary dark ages of the eukaryotic cell|url=http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/content/41/1/451.long|journal=Biochem Soc Trans|volume=41|issue=1|pages=451–7|doi=10.1042/BST20120292|pmid=23356327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of cell wall and formation of membrane-lined compartments are the kind of things that we might expect occurring in the eukaryotic stem groups. In the same way, mitochondrial acquisition must not be regarded as the end of the process, for still new complex families of genes had to be developed after or during the endosymbiotic exchange. In this way, from FECA to LECA, we can think of organisms that can be considered as protoeukaryotes. At the end of the process, LECA was already a complex organism with the presence of protein families involved in cellular compartmentalization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Elucidation of this problem from paleontological record is hindered due to taphonomic loss of biomarkers and the small likelihood that cells without walls or other coverings fossilize. This taphonomic barrier blurs our view of the FECA-LECA transition. The recognition of early eukaryotes lies on general eukaryotic features: larger size, morphological complexity and multicellularity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this sense, the most common fossils clearly assigned to eukaryotes are to acanthomorphic [[acritarch]]s, ornate carbonaceous vesicles with no taxonomic affiliation. The oldest  of these fossils that can be assigned to eukaryotes date back to the late [[Paleoproterozoic|Palaeoproterozoic]] in the acritarchs ''[[Tappania]]'' and ''[[Shuiyousphaeridium]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Findings of other fossils exhibiting structural complexity, albeit not taxonomically resolved, consolidate the fact of pre-[[Ediacaran]] eukaryotic life. The oldest unambiguous crown eukaryote is dated in the late [[Mesoproterozoic]] and is the ''[[Bangiomorpha]],'' which can be recognized as a [[red algae]].

In this way, at the origin of crown eukaryotes, we find a situation in which even if we can identify early eukaryotic forms, most cannot be affiliated to any lineage, which leaves also unresolved the post-LECA stages of the origin of crown-eukaryotes.

Of notice, some authors suggest that the view of eukaryotes as  a crown group is obsolete, and instead suggest that fungi, plants and animals evolved independently from different unicellular ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Embley TM, Martin W|date=March 2006|title=Eukaryotic evolution, changes and challenges.|journal=Nature|volume=440|issue=7084|pages=623–630|bibcode=2006Natur.440..623E|doi=10.1038/nature04546|pmid=16572163|s2cid=4396543|url=https://zenodo.org/record/897869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and habitat==

Many [[lichen]]s grow close to the surface of rocks, tree trunks, and other substrata, and are referred to as crustose lichens. Crustose organisms can be detrimental to engineered structures when found on buildings, coastal structures, and ships.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

There are different types of Crustose lichens, including endolithic, endophloidic and leprose. Endolithic lichens are immersed in the outer layer of rocks with their bodies above the surface. Endophloidic ones are located in or on plant tissue. Leprose lichens consist of crusts without a layered structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lichen Vocabulary|url=http://www.lichen.com/vocabulary.html|accessdate=16 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120063843/http://www.lichen.com/vocabulary.html|archive-date=20 January 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustose lichens have learned to adapt to their environment, with the shells helping with adaptation to dry and [[drought]] resistant climates. Crustose lichens have been found in deserts, ice free parts of Antarctica, and in the Alpine and Arctic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/144892/crustose-thallus|accessdate=16 May 2013|title=Crustose thallus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Crustose can come in a variety of colors such as yellow, orange, red, gray and green. These colors tend to be bright and vibrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lichen Biology|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/interesting/lichens/biology/growthforms.shtml|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Crustose is similar to other lichens because they share a similar internal morphology. The lichen's body is formed from filaments of the fungal partner. The density of these filaments determines the layers within the lichen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morphology of Lichens|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichenmm.html|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productivity ==
There are many variations of crustose, including Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA), found in three different habitats; flat, crest and slope reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Angela J.|last2=Steneck|first2=Robert S.|last3=Tager|first3=Danika|last4=Pandolfi|first4=John M.|date=2015-06-01|title=Distribution, abundance and diversity of crustose coralline algae on the Great Barrier Reef|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=581–594|doi=10.1007/s00338-015-1263-5|issn=1432-0975|bibcode=2015CorRe..34..581D}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCA are highly dependent on sunlight to grow in abundance, and their growth increases productivity.

A '''cryotank''' or '''cryogenic tank''' is a tank that is used to store material at very low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/01/michigan_blood_reaches_milesto.html|title=Michigan Blood reaches milestone with delivery of donated umbilical cord blood |last=Kopenkoskey|first=Paul R. |date=2 January 2012|publisher=Michigan Live|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "cryotank" refers to storage of super-cold fuels, such as [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid hydrogen]]. Cryotanks and [[cryogenics]] can be seen in many sci-fi movies, but they are still currently undeveloped. All that needs to be done is for a human to be loaded into the tank and then they can be frozen until a time comes when any diseases they have can be cured and they can live an even longer life. This could also be used in space travel and just preserving human life in general.  The problem with this is when the human body is frozen, ice crystals form in the cells. The ice crystals then continue to expand rupturing the cell wall and destroying the integrity of the cell, or killing it.&lt;ref&gt;You put antifreeze inside your car, so even though outside, everything can be frozen solid, but inside your car liquids still flow normally and so your car still runs. In the same way, glucose is an [[antifreeze]] for frogs and certain fish that their bodies could still be in liquid form with blood circulating even though they are frozen solid on the outside.&lt;/ref&gt;

This means in order for humans to undergo the cryogenic process a way to significantly raise the levels of [[glucose]] produced in the human body is needed.

== Material Uses ==
[[Cryogenic]] tanks are used to store natural gases such as [[oxygen]], [[argon]], [[nitrogen]], [[helium]], [[hydrogen]] and other materials. Tanks can store the materials at the correct temperature and pressure for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prentex.com/cryogenic_vessels.php|title= Cryogenic Vessels | year = 2005| publisher= Prentex Alloy Fabricators Inc.| accessdate= 16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/comp_cryotank.html|title= Technology| date = 31 October 2012| publisher= NASA| accessdate= 16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science fiction ===
{{Further|:Category:Cryonics in fiction}}
In science fiction, cryogenic tanks are used to freeze people. ''cry-'' is a Greek prefix which means "cold or freezing", hence humans are stored in the tank frozen until a future date.
Cryotanks are found in some science fiction films such as ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Host (2013 film)|The Host]]'' (2013).

In [[ecology]], '''crypsis''' is the ability of an animal or a plant&lt;ref name=Gianoli&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gianoli |first1=Ernesto|last2=Carrasco-Urra |first2=Fernando |title=Leaf Mimicry in a Climbing Plant Protects against Herbivory |journal=Current Biology |year=2014 |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=984–987|doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.010|pmid=24768053|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid observation or detection by other animals. It may be a [[aggressive mimicry|predation strategy]] or an [[antipredator adaptation]]. Methods include [[camouflage]], [[nocturnality]], [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] lifestyle and [[Batesian mimicry|mimicry]]. Crypsis can involve visual, olfactory (with [[pheromone]]s), or auditory concealment. When it is visual, the term '''cryptic coloration''', effectively a synonym for animal camouflage, is sometimes used, but many different [[list of camouflage methods|methods of camouflage]] are employed by animals or plants.&lt;ref name=Gianoli /&gt;

==Overview==
There is a strong [[evolution]]ary pressure for animals to blend into their environment or conceal their shape, for prey animals to avoid predators and for predators to be able to avoid detection by prey. Exceptions include large [[herbivore]]s without natural enemies, brilliantly colored birds that rely on flight to escape predators, and [[venomous]] or otherwise powerfully armed animals with [[aposematism|warning coloration]]. Cryptic animals include the [[tawny frogmouth]] (feather patterning resembles bark), the [[tuatara]] (hides in burrows all day; nocturnal), some [[jellyfish]] (transparent), the [[leafy sea dragon]], and the [[flounder]] (covers itself in sediment).

==Methods==

Methods of crypsis include (visual) camouflage, [[nocturnality]], and subterranean lifestyle. Camouflage can be achieved by a [[List of camouflage methods|wide variety of methods]], from [[disruptive coloration]] to [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] and some forms of [[mimicry]], even in habitats like the open sea where there is no background.&lt;ref name=zuanon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zuanon |first=J.|author2=I.

As a strategy, crypsis is used by [[aggressive mimicry|predators against prey]] and by [[antipredator adaptation|prey against predators]].&lt;ref name=zuanon/&gt;

Crypsis also applies to [[egg (biology)|eggs]]&lt;ref name=nguyen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nguyen |first=L.

===Visual===
{{Main article|Camouflage}}
[[File:Jumping spider with prey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camouflage]] allows animals like this [[Disruptive coloration|disruptively-patterned]] spider to capture prey more easily.]]

Many animals have evolved so that they visually resemble their surroundings by using any of the [[List of camouflage methods|many methods of natural camouflage]] that may match the color and texture of the surroundings (cryptic coloration) and/or break up the visual outline of the animal itself ([[disruptive coloration]]). Such animals, like [[Ctenophorus decresii|the tawny dragon lizard]], may resemble rocks, sand, twigs, leaves, and even bird droppings ([[mimesis]]). Other methods including transparency and silvering are widely used [[underwater camouflage|by marine animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morning-earth.org/graphic-E/Transf-Mimic.html |title=All Lives Transform:Adaptation- Mimicry |publisher=Morning-earth.org |date=February 14, 2007 |access-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218081452/http://www.morning-earth.org/graphic-E/Transf-Mimic.html |archive-date=February 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animals change color in changing environments seasonally, as in [[Stoat|ermine]] and [[snowshoe hare]], or far more rapidly with [[chromatophore]]s in their integuments, as in [[chameleon]] and [[cephalopod]]s such as [[squid]].

[[Countershading]], the use of different colors on upper and lower surfaces in graduating tones from a light belly to a darker back, is common in the sea and on land. It is sometimes called Thayer's law, after the American artist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]], who published a paper on the form in 1896 that explained that countershading paints out shadows to make solid objects appear flat, reversing the way that artists use paint to make flat paintings contain solid objects. Where the background is brighter than is possible even with white pigment, [[counter-illumination]] in marine animals, such as squid, can use light to match the background.

Some animals actively camouflage themselves with local materials. The [[decorator crab]]s attach plants, animals, small stones, or shell fragments to their carapaces to provide camouflage that matches the local environment. Some species preferentially select stinging animals such as [[sea anemones]] or noxious plants, benefiting from [[aposematism]] as well as or instead of crypsis.&lt;ref name=Hultgren&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/stachowicz/papers/Hultgren_Stachowicz_2011_BookChapter.pdf |title=Animal Camouflage |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |work=Camouflage in decorator crabs: Camouflage in decorator crabs |year=2011 |access-date=December 13, 2012 |author=Hultgren, Kristin |author2=Stachowicz, Jay |author3=Stevens, M. |author4=Merilaita, S. |name-list-style=amp |archive-date=August 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815183654/http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/stachowicz/papers/Hultgren_Stachowicz_2011_BookChapter.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olfactory===
Some animals, in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, appear to camouflage their odor, which might otherwise attract predators.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Conover. Predator-Prey Dynamics: the role of olfaction. CRC Press. 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-9270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous arthropods, both insects and spiders, mimic ants, whether to avoid predation, to hunt ants, or (for example in the [[large blue butterfly]] caterpillar) to trick the ants into feeding them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Horace |last=Donisthorpe |title=Mimicry of Ants by Other Arthropods |volume=69 |issue =3–4 |pages=307–311 |date=January 1922 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1922.tb02812.x |journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/37051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pirate perch]] (''Aphredoderus sayanus'') may exhibit chemical crypsis, making them undetectable to frogs and insects colonizing ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=William J. Jr. |last1=Resetarits |first2=Christopher A. |last2=Binckley |title=Is the pirate really a ghost?

===Auditory===
Some insects, notably some [[Noctuidae|Noctuid moths]], (such as the [[large yellow underwing]]), and some [[Arctiidae|tiger moths]], (such as the [[garden tiger]]), were originally theorized to defend themselves against predation by [[animal echolocation|echolocating]] bats, both by passively absorbing sound with soft, fur-like body coverings and by actively creating sounds to mimic echoes from other locations or objects.  The active strategy was described as a "phantom echo" that might therefore represent "auditory crypsis", with alternative theories about interfering with the bats' echolocation ("jamming").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Lee A. |last2=Surlykke |first2=Annemarie |title=How Some Insects Detect and Avoid Being Eaten by Bats: Tactics and Countertactics of Prey and Predator |journal=BioScience |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=570–581 |date=July 2001 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0570:HSIDAA]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/honr278c/PDF/Miller01.pdf |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=10.1641/0006-3568%282001%29051%5B0555%3ARTTMWE%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |title=Full Access Return to the Magic Well: Echolocation Behavior of Bats and Responses of Insect Prey |author=Griffin, Donald R. |journal=BioScience |date=July 2001 |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=555–556 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0555:RTTMWE]2.0.CO;2|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequent research has provided evidence for only two functions of moth sounds, neither of which involve "auditory crypsis". Tiger moth species appear to cluster into two distinct groups. One type produces sounds as acoustic [[aposematism]], warning the bats that the moths are unpalatable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hristov |first1=N. I. |last2=Conner |first2=W.E. |year=2005 |title=Sound strategy: acoustic aposematism in the bat–tiger moth arms race |journal=[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=92 |issue=4|pages=164–169 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0611-7 |pmid=15772807|bibcode=2005NW.....92..164H |s2cid=18306198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or at least performing as acoustic [[mimicry|mimic]]s of unpalatable moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=J. R. |last2=Conner |first2=W. E. |year=2007 |title=Acoustic mimicry in a predator–prey interaction |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=22 |pages=9331–9334 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0703627104 |pmid=17517637 |pmc=1890494|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.9331B |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other type uses sonar jamming. In the latter type of moth, detailed analyses failed to support a "phantom echo" mechanism underlying sonar jamming, but instead pointed towards echo interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corcoran |first1=A.J. |last2=Conner |first2=W.E. |last3=Barber |first3=J.R. |year=2010 |title=Anti-bat tiger moth sounds: Form and function | journal=Current Zoology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=358–369 |doi=10.1093/czoolo/56.3.358 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

'''Cultural hitchhiking''' is a hypothesized [[Dual inheritance theory|gene-culture coevolutionary]] process through which cultural selection, [[sexual selection]] based on cultural preference, limits the diversity at genetically neutral loci being transmitted in parallel to selective cultural traits. The process is thought to account for exceptionally low diversity in neutral loci such as [[MtDNA control region|control regions]] of the mitochondrial genome unaccounted for by any other selective forces. Simply put, selection for certain learned social and cultural behaviors can manifest in specific shaping of a population’s genetic makeup. While the notion that culture plays a significant role in shaping community genetics is widely accepted in the context of human populations it had not been considered or documented in non-human organisms until the late 1990s. The term was coined by the cetologist [[Hal Whitehead]] who studies the cultures and population genetics of matrilineal whale communities.

Cultural hitchhiking has been proposed as a cause for reduced [[genetic diversity]] at certain loci in prehistoric  ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', [[dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and [[sperm whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitehead |first1=Hal |title=Cultural specialization and genetic diversity: Killer whales and beyond |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |date=April 2020 |volume=490 |pages=110164 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110164 |pmid=31954108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural hitchhiking is a significant hypothesis because it investigates the relationship between population [[genetics]] and [[culture]]. By understanding how social behavior can shape the genetic makeup of communities scientists are better able to explain why certain communities have genetic traits distinct from the larger population.

== In whales ==
The process was initially proposed by Whitehead in a 1998 paper as an explanation for the low genetic diversity in [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] whale species. In these communities, female individuals remain grouped together with their mothers and other female relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitehead |first1=Hal |title=Genetic Diversity in the Matrilineal Whales: Models of Cultural Hitchhiking and Group-Specific Non-heritable Demographic Variation |journal=Marine Mammal Science |date=January 2005 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=58–79 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2005.tb01208.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; They appear to select mates from outside their immediate community based on culturally valued social traits and aptitude. Sequencing of the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genome]] of individuals within these communities revealed them to have a significantly reduced diversity in certain control loci compared to comparable [[Panmixia|panmictic]] populations. Whitehead discovered that the relative frequency of [[Haplotype|mitochondrial haplotypes]] characteristic of groups exhibiting more highly adaptive socially learned traits would increase, while the frequency of these haplotypes in groups with less adaptive socially learned traits would decrease. This coincidental selective pressure is thought to have led to an overall reduction in haplotype diversity across the entire species population.

== In dolphins ==
In 2014 a team of biologists from the [[University of South Wales]] attributed a remarkable geographic distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes among adjacent populations of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in a bay in Western Australia to cultural hitchhiking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kopps |first1=Anna M. |last2=Ackermann |first2=Corinne Y. |last3=Sherwin |first3=William B. |last4=Allen |first4=Simon J. |last5=Bejder |first5=Lars |last6=Krützen |first6=Michael |title=Cultural transmission of tool use combined with habitat specializations leads to fine-scale genetic structure in bottlenose dolphins |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=7 May 2014 |volume=281 |issue=1782 |pages=20133245 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.3245 |pmid=24648223 |pmc=3973264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitehead |first1=Hal |last2=Vachon |first2=Felicia |last3=Frasier |first3=Timothy R. |title=Cultural Hitchhiking in the Matrilineal Whales |journal=Behavior Genetics |date=May 2017 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=324–334 |doi=10.1007/s10519-017-9840-8 |pmid=28275880 |s2cid=3866892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found Whitehead’s hypothesis that selection for learned social traits affected diversity in neutral gene loci fit well with their observations. It was discovered that dolphins with two of three mitochondrial haplotypes were found predominantly in water deeper than 10 m while those with the third haplotypes were found predominantly in depths less than 10 m. This geographic distinction between these populations is also associated with different learned behaviors. Some of the dolphins predominantly found in deeper waters exhibit foraging strategies that implement tools such as a sponge placed on their beak. This "sponging" behavior is found to be spread through vertical social transmission along a matrilineal pattern (i.e. the mothers teach the behavior to their offspring). All dolphins exhibiting one of the deepwater haplotypes belong to a single matriline. The researchers ultimately concluded that these fine-scale genetic structures, the distinct mitochondrial haplotypes, have probably arisen based on socially transmitted behaviors or in other words, through cultural hitchhiking. A study in the same area and species showed that [[shelling (fishing)|shelling]] is also marginally learned from associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wild |first1=Sonja |last2=Hoppitt |first2=William J. E. |last3=Allen |first3=Simon J. |last4=Krützen |first4=Michael |title=Integrating Genetic, Environmental, and Social Networks to Reveal Transmission Pathways of a Dolphin Foraging Innovation |journal=Current Biology |date=3 August 2020 |volume=30 |issue=15 |pages=3024–3030.e4 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2020.05.069 |pmid=32589911 |s2cid=220057226 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In early humans ==
Cultural hitchhiking has been proposed as an explanation for a widely inferred and abrupt [[Population bottleneck|Y-chromosome population bottleneck]] across several [[Old World]] (Africa, Europe, Asia) populations around 4000-6000 BC. This bottleneck is thought to suggest a significant decline in the effective male population during [[Neolithic]] times to an estimated 1/20th its original size. Though mitochondrial sequence records seem to indicate uninhibited population increase at this time meaning there was likely an extreme divergence in the size of male and female population sizes during the bottleneck period. A team of international genetics, archaeology, and anthropology researchers in a 2018 article hypothesized that the bottleneck was a consequence of intergroup competition between patrilineal kin groups, which caused cultural hitchhiking between Y-chromosomes and cultural groups and reduction in Y-chromosomal diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zeng |first1=Tian Chen |last2=Aw |first2=Alan J. |last3=Feldman |first3=Marcus W. |title=Cultural hitchhiking and competition between patrilineal kin groups explain the post-Neolithic Y-chromosome bottleneck |journal=Nature Communications |date=December 2018 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=2077 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-04375-6 |pmid=29802241 |pmc=5970157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors Zeng et al. argue that competition between patrilineal kin communities produces two mechanisms with limiting effect on Y-chromosome diversity. One mechanism being these patrilineal groups by virtue of common descent produce elevated levels of Y-chromosome homogeneity and high inter-group diversity. The second mechanism is violent inter-group competition which disproportionately results in male group member casualties and therefore concentration of like y-chronotypes and in some cases extinction complete extinction of entire lineages.

== History ==
=== Initial research ===
The theoretical possibility of growing meat in an industrial setting has long been of interest. In a 1931 essay published by various periodicals and later included in his work ''Thoughts and Adventures'', British statesman [[Winston Churchill]] wrote: "We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium."&lt;ref&gt;[https://winstonchurchill.org/publications/churchill-bulletin/bulletin-115-jan-2018/no-bull/ "No Bull".] - [[International Churchill Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Dutch researcher [[Willem van Eelen]] independently came up with the idea for cultured meat. As a [[prisoner of war]] during the [[Second World War]], Van Eelen suffered from starvation, leaving him passionate about food production and food security.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Purdy|first=Chase|date=2017-09-24|title=The idea for lab-grown meat was born in a prisoner-of-war camp|url=https://qz.com/1077183/the-idea-for-lab-grown-meat-was-born-in-a-prisoner-of-war-camp/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-02-09|website=Quartz|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924160836/https://qz.com/1077183/the-idea-for-lab-grown-meat-was-born-in-a-prisoner-of-war-camp/ |archive-date=24 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a university lecture discussing the prospects of preserved meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Specter|first=Michael|date=2011-05-16|title=Test-Tube Burgers|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/23/test-tube-burgers|url-status=live|access-date=2021-02-09|magazine=The New Yorker|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier discovery of [[cell lines]] provided the basis for the idea.

''In vitro'' cultivation of [[Myocyte|muscle fibers]] was first performed successfully in 1971 when pathologist [[Russell Ross|Russel Ross]] cultured [[guinea pig|guinea-pig]] [[Aorta#Other animals|aorta]].

In 1991, [[Jon F. Vein]] secured patent {{Patent|US|6835390}} for the production of tissue-engineered meat for human consumption, wherein muscle and fat would be grown in an integrated fashion to create food products.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://futuristspeaker.com/future-of-agriculture/the-future-of-the-cultured-meats-industry-in-2040/|title=The Future of the Cultured Meats Industry in 2040|last=Frey|first=Thomas|date=30 May 2019|website=Futurist Speaker|access-date=20 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Dermatology|dermatologist]] Wiete Westerhof along with van Eelen and businessperson Willem van Kooten announced that they had filed for a worldwide patent on a process to produce cultured meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=WO|status=application|number=9931222|title=Industrial scale production of meat from in vitro cell cultures|inventor-last=van Eelen|inventor2-last=van Kooten|inventor3-last=Westerhof|inventor-first=Willem Frederik|inventor2-first=Willem Jan|inventor3-first=Wiete|pubdate=1999-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process empoyed a [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] of [[collagen]] seeded with [[muscle]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] bathed in a nutritious solution and induced to divide.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kadim|first1=Isam T|last2=Mahgoub|first2=Osman|last3=Baqir|first3=Senan|last4=Faye|first4=Bernard|last5=Purchas|first5=Roger|date=February 2015|title=Cultured meat from muscle stem cells: A review of challenges and prospects|journal=Journal of Integrative Agriculture|volume=14|issue=2|pages=222–233|doi=10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60881-9|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, [[NASA]] began conducting cultured meat experiments, with the intent of allowing astronauts to grow meat instead of transporting it. In partnership with Morris Benjaminson, they cultivated goldfish and turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/lab-grown-meat-is-on-the-way/|title=Lab-Grown Meat Is on the Way|last=Shapiro|first=Paul|website=Scientific American: Observations |date=December 19, 2017 |access-date=20 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Oron Catts]] and [[Ionat Zurr]] exhibited a few centimeters of "steak", grown from frog [[stem cells]], which they cooked and ate. The goal was to start a conversation surrounding the ethics of cultured meat—"was it ever alive?", "was it ever killed?", "is it in any way disrespectful to an animal to throw it away?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ingestion / Disembodied Cuisine|url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/16/catts_zurr.php|newspaper=Cabinet Magazine|date=Winter 2004–2005 |first1=Oron |last1=Catts |first2=Ionat |last2=Zurr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, American public health student Jason Matheny traveled to [[India]] and visited a factory chicken farm. He was appalled by the implications of this system. Matheny later teamed up with three scientists involved in NASA's efforts. In 2004, Matheny founded New Harvest to encourage development by funding research. In 2005 the four published the first [[peer-reviewed literature]] on the subject.&lt;ref name="university maryland"&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Paper Says Edible Meat Can be Grown in a Lab on Industrial Scale | publisher = [[University of Maryland]] | date = 6 July 2005 | url = http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/scitech/release.cfm?ArticleID=1098 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050725080845/http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/scitech/release.cfm?ArticleID=1098 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 25 July 2005 | access-date = 12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] offered a $1 million prize to the first company to bring cultured chicken meat to consumers by 2012.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{Citation |last = Levine |first = Ketzel |author-link = Ketzel Levine |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |title = Lab-Grown Meat a Reality, But Who Will Eat It? |newspaper = NPR.org |date = 20 May 2008 |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90235492 |access-date = 10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contestant was required to complete two tasks to earn the prize: 

- produce a cultured chicken meat product that was indistinguishable from real chicken and 

- produce the product in large enough quantities to be competitively sold in at least 10 states.

The contest was later extended until 4 March 2014. The deadline eventually expired without a winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/features/vitro-meat-contest/|title=PETA's 'In Vitro' Chicken Contest|date=6 October 2008|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=5 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Dutch government]] invested $4 million into experiments regarding cultured meat.&lt;ref name="australian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|author-link=Ben Macintyre|date=20 January 2007|title=Test-tube meat science's next leap|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/test-tube-meat-sciences-next-leap/story-e6frg8y6-1111112859219|url-status=dead|access-date=26 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102144404/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/test-tube-meat-sciences-next-leap/story-e6frg8y6-1111112859219|archive-date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The In Vitro Meat Consortium, a group formed by international researchers, held the first international conference hosted by the [[Norwegian Food Research Institute|Food Research Institute]] of [[Norway]] in April.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Siegelbaum|first=D.J.|date=23 April 2008|title=In Search of a Test-Tube Hamburger|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1734630,00.html?imw=Y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122081137/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1734630,00.html?imw=Y|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 January 2010|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declared cultured meat production to be one of the 50 breakthrough ideas of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1934027_1934003_1933982,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115062549/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1934027_1934003_1933982,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 November 2009 |title=The 50 Best Inventions of 2009|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, scientists from the [[Netherlands]] announced they had managed to grow meat using cells from a live pig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6936352.ece|title=Scientists grow pork meat in a laboratory|date=29 November 2009|last=Rogers|first=Lois|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|location=London|access-date=8 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106153649/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6936352.ece|archive-date=6 January 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First public trial===
[[File:First cultured hamburger fried.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The first cultured meat hamburger, produced in 2013]]
The first cultured beef [[Hamburger|burger]] patty was created by Mark Post at Maastricht University in 2013.&lt;ref name="BBC5Aug"&gt;{{Cite news|date=5 August 2013|title=World's first lab-grown burger is eaten in London|newspaper=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23576143|access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made from over 20,000 thin strands of muscle tissue, cost over $300,000 and needed 2 years to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Fountain|first=Henry|title=Engineering the $325,000 In Vitro Burger|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/science/engineering-the-325000-in-vitro-burger.html|access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burger was tested on live television in London on 5 August 2013. It was cooked by chef Richard McGeown of Couch's Great House Restaurant, [[Polperro]], Cornwall, and tasted by critics [[Hanni Rützler]], a food researcher from the Future Food Studio, and Josh Schonwald. Rützler stated, "There is really a bite to it, there is quite some flavour with the browning. I know there is no fat in it so I didn't really know how juicy it would be, but there is quite some intense taste; it's close to meat, it's not that juicy, but the consistency is perfect. This is meat to me... It's really something to bite on and I think the look is quite similar." Rützler added that even in a [[blind trial]] she would have taken the product for meat rather than [[Textured vegetable protein|a soya copy]].&lt;ref name="Hogenboom"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Hogenboom|first1=Melissa|date=2013-08-05|title=What does a stem cell burger taste like?|newspaper=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23529841|access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch startup Meatable, consisting of Krijn de Nood, Daan Luining, Ruud Out, Roger Pederson, Mark Kotter and Gordana Apic among others, reported in September 2018 that it had succeeded in growing meat using [[pluripotent stem cells]] from animal [[umbilical cord]]s.

In August 2019, five American startups announced the formation of the Alliance for Meat, Poultry &amp; Seafood Innovation (AMPS Innovation), a coalition seeking to work with regulators to create a pathway to market for cultured meat and seafood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/30HKLA5|title=Cell-based meat companies join forces|last=Evich|first=Helena Bottemiller|website=Politico |date=29 August 2019|access-date=14 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members include [[Eat Just]], [[Memphis Meats]], Finless Foods, BlueNalu, and Fork &amp; Goode.&lt;ref name="PurdyOct2019"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1698237/cell-cultured-meat-companies-now-have-a-lobbying-group/|title=Cell-cultured meat companies just created a brand-new lobbying group|last=Purdy|first=Chase|website=Quartz |date=29 August 2019 |access-date=14 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in December 2021, a group of 13 European and Israeli companies ([[Aleph Farms]], Bluu Biosciences, Cubiq Foods, [[Future Meat Technologies|Future Meat]], Gourmey, Higher Steaks, Ivy Farm, [[Meatable]], Mirai Foods, [[Mosa Meat]], [[MeaTech|Peace of Meat]], [[SuperMeat]], and Vital Meat) established Cellular Agriculture Europe, a Belgium-based association that sought to 'find common ground and speak with a shared voice for the good of the industry, consumers, and regulators'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.meatable.com/cellular-agriculture-europe/ |title=Meatable becomes a founding member of newly created association for cellular agriculture |author= |work=Meatable.com |publisher=Meatable |date=3 December 2021 |access-date=10 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://vegconomist.com/cultivated/cellular-agriculture-europe/ |title=Cellular Agriculture Europe Launches to Become the "Voice of the Cultivated Industry" |author= |work=Vegconomist |date=7 December 2021 |access-date=10 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/cellular-agriculture-europe/ |title=Cellular Agriculture Europe Offers a Powerful Voice to the Cultivated Meat, Seafood, and Ingredients Industry |author=Amy Buxton |work=Green Queen |date=8 December 2021 |access-date=10 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the Foieture project was launched in [[Belgium]] with the goal of developing cultured [[foie gras]] (the name is a portmanteau of 'foie' and 'future') by a consortium of 3 companies (cultured-meat startup Peace of Meat, small meat-[[seasoning]] company Solina, and small [[pâté]]-producing company Nauta) and 3 non-profit institutes (university [[KU Leuven]], food industry innovation centre Flanders Food, and Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant).&lt;ref name="Vlaanderen"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Dieter De Cleene|date=17 December 2019|title=Vlaanderen investeert in kweekvlees|language=nl|work=Eos Wetenschap (magazine)|url=https://www.eoswetenschap.eu/voeding/vlaanderen-investeert-kweekvlees|access-date=26 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace of Meat stated in December 2019 that it intended to complete its proof of concept in 2020, to produce its first prototype in 2022, and to go to market in 2023.&lt;ref name="Vlaanderen" /&gt; That month, the Foieture project received a research grant of almost 3.6 million euros from the Innovation and Enterprise Agency of the [[Flemish Government]].&lt;ref name="Vlaanderen" /&gt; In May 2020, Peace of Meat's Austrian-born cofounder and scientific researcher Eva Sommer stated that the startup was then able to produce 20 grams of cultured fat at a cost of about 300 euros (€15,000/kg); the goal was to reduce the price to 6 euros per kilogram by 2030.&lt;ref name="Degroote"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vmt.nl/duurzaamheid-mvo/nieuws/2020/05/belgisch-bedrijf-bouwt-2-labos-voor-kweekvlees-10141488 |title=Belgisch bedrijf bouwt 2 labo's voor kweekvlees |author=Yves Degroote |work=[[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]] |date=8 May 2020 |access-date=27 May 2020 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piece of Meat built two laboratories in the [[Port of Antwerp]].&lt;ref name="Degroote" /&gt; In late 2020, [[MeaTech]] acquired Peace of Meat for 15 million euros, and announced in May 2021 that it would build a new large-scale pilot plant in Antwerp by 2022.&lt;ref name="Broens"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/voeding-drank/plannen-voor-belgische-proeffabriek-voor-kweekvet/10305522.html |title=Plannen voor Belgische proeffabriek voor kweekvet |author=Bert Broens, Jens Cardinaels |work=[[De Tijd]] |date=14 May 2021 |access-date=7 December 2021 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Aleph Farms collaborated with 3D Bioprinting Solutions to culture meat on the [[International Space Station]]. This was done by extruding meat cells onto a scaffold using a 3D printer.&lt;ref name="spacegrown"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=October 7, 2019|title=First meat grown in space lab 248 miles from Earth|publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media Limited|agency=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/07/wheres-the-beef-248-miles-up-as-first-meat-is-grown-in-a-space-lab|access-date=July 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2020, ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' found around 30 cultured meat startups, and that Memphis Meats, Just Inc. and [[Future Meat Technologies]] were the most advanced because they were building pilot plants.&lt;ref name="PurdyJan2020"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://qz.com/1788892/memphis-meats-plans-to-build-the-first-us-cell-based-meat-plant/ |title=A startup says it's building a US pilot plant for cell-based meat |first=Chase |last=Purdy |work=Quartz |date=22 January 2020 |access-date=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PurdyMay2020"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://qz.com/1856344/cultured-meat-startups-want-to-fix-the-broken-meat-supply-chain/amp/ |title=As the US meat supply chain fumbles, cultured meat startups consider a better system |first=Chase |last=Purdy |work=Quartz |date=13 May 2020 |access-date=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[New Scientist]]'' in May 2020, 60 start-ups were developing cultured meat. Some of these were technology suppliers.&lt;ref name="NS2020"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24032080-400-accelerating-the-cultured-meat-revolution/ |title=Accelerating the cultured meat revolution |work=New Scientist |date=20 May 2020 |access-date=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth media reportedly still cost "hundreds of dollars per litre, but for clean meat production to scale this needs to drop to around $1 a litre."&lt;ref name="NS2020"/&gt; In June 2020, Chinese government officials called for a national strategy to compete in cultured meat.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-06-25|title=Chinese Official Calls for National Strategy to Allow China to Keep up With Other Countries Making Progress in Cultured Meat|url=https://vegconomist.com/society/chinese-official-calls-for-national-strategy-to-allow-china-to-keep-up-with-other-countries-making-progress-in-cultured-meat/|access-date=August 12, 2020|website=Vegconomist|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2020, Indian start-up Clear Meat claimed it had managed to cultivate chicken mince at the cost of only 800–850 [[Indian rupee]]s (US$10.77–11.44), while a slaughtered processed chicken cost about 1000 rupees.&lt;ref name="Clear Meat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/indian-cell-based-meat-company-claims-it-has-achieved-price-parity/ |title=Indian Cell-Based Meat Company Claims it Has Achieved Price Parity |work=Vegconomist |date=30 November 2020 |access-date=8 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market entry ===
In the [[European Union]], [[novel food]]s such as cultured meat products have to go through a testing period of about 18 months during which a company must prove to the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) that their product is safe.&lt;ref name="Morrison BioTech"/&gt;

In November 2020, [[SuperMeat]] opened a 'test restaurant' in [[Ness Ziona]], Israel, right next to its pilot plant; journalists, experts and a small number of consumers could book an appointment to taste the novel food there, while looking through a glass window into the production facility on the other side. The restaurant was not yet fully open to the public, because as of June 2021 SuperMeat still needed to wait for regulatory approval to start mass production for public consumption, and because the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] restricted restaurant operations.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/04/no-kill-lab-grown-chicken-burger-restaurant-israel |title=I tried the world's first no-kill, lab-grown chicken burger |author=Oliver Holmes |work=The Guardian |date=4 December 2021 |access-date=6 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandel"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/lab-grown-chicken-food-revolution-gathers-pace-at-ness-ziona-eatery/ |title=Lab-grown chicken 'food revolution' gathers pace at Ness Ziona eatery |author=Jonah Mandel |work=Times of Israel |date=23 June 2021 |access-date=6 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2020, the [[Singapore Food Agency]] approved the "chicken bites" produced by Eat Just for commercial sale. It marked the first time that a cultured meat product passed the safety review (which took 2 years) of a food regulator, and was widely regarded as a milestone for the industry. The chicken bits were scheduled for introduction in Singaporean restaurants.&lt;ref name="Carrington"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/02/no-kill-lab-grown-meat-to-go-on-sale-for-first-time |title=No-kill, lab-grown meat to go on sale for first time |author=Damian Carrington |work=The Guardian |date=2 December 2020 |access-date=2 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurant "1880" became the first to serve cultured meat to customers on Saturday 19 December 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/singapore-restaurant-first-ever-to-serve-eat-just-lab-grown-chicken.html |title=This restaurant will be the first ever to serve lab-grown chicken (for $23) |author=Jade Scipioni |work=CNBC |date=18 December 2020 |access-date=6 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201220005063/en/Eat-Just-Makes-History-Again-with-Restaurant-Debut-of-Cultured-Meat |title=Eat Just Makes History (Again) with Restaurant Debut of Cultured Meat |author=Andrew Noyes |work=Business Wire |date=21 December 2020 |access-date=6 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2022, cultured meat producers had reached the level of attempting to gain regulatory approval from European Union supranational institutions coming just before mass goods could be sold to consumers.&lt;ref name=Dutch/&gt;

On April 27, 2022, the [[European Commission]] approved the request for the collection of signatures for the [[European Citizens' Initiative]] ''End The Slaughter Age'' to shift subsidies from animal husbandry to cellular agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/scienze/ue-approva-raccolta-firme-per-stop-sussidi-agli-allevamenti-e-incentivare-carne-vegetale-e-coltivata/|title=UE approva raccolta firme per togliere i sussidi agli allevamenti e incentivare la carne vegetale e coltivata|website=[[Fanpage.it]]|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
===Cell lines===
Cellular agriculture requires cell lines, generally stem cells. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which have the potential to become many or all of the required kinds of specialized cell types. Totipotent stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the different cell types found within the body. Pluripotent stem cells can mature into all cell types save those in the placenta, and multipotent stem cells can differentiate into several specialized cells within one lineage. Unipotent stem cells can differentiate into one specific cell fate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Frequently asked questions about stem cell research|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117|access-date=2020-10-17|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stem cell differentiation.svg|thumb|275x275px|Stem cells can differentiate into a range of specialized cells.]]
While pluripotent stem cells would be an ideal source, the most prominent example of this subcategory is [[embryonic stem cells]] which—due to ethical issues—are controversial for use in research. As a result, scientists have developed [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] (iPSCs)—essentially multipotent blood and skin cells that have been regressed to a pluripotent state enabling them to differentiate into a greater range of cells.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS) {{!}} UCLA Broad Stem Cell Center|url=https://stemcell.ucla.edu/induced-pluripotent-stem-cells#:~:text=iPSC%20are%20derived%20from%20skin,cell%20needed%20for%20therapeutic%20purposes.|access-date=2020-10-17|website=stemcell.ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative is using multipotent adult stem cells that give rise to muscle cell lineages or unipotent progenitors which differentiate into muscle cells.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Favourable characteristics of stem cells include immortality, proliferative ability, unreliance on adherence, serum independence and easy differentiation into tissue. However, the natural presence of such characteristics are likely to differ across cell species and origin. As such, ''in vitro'' cultivation must be adjusted to fill the exact needs of a specific cell line.&amp;nbsp; With regards to immortality, cells have a limit on the number of times they can divide that is dictated by their [[telomere]] cap—supplementary [[\|nucleotide]] bases added to the end of their chromosomes. With each division, the telomere cap progressively shortens until nothing remains, in which case the cell ceases to divide. By inducing pluripotency, the telomere cap can be lengthened such that the cell divides indefinitely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cell lines can be collected from a primary source, i.e., through a [[biopsy]] on an animal under local anesthesia. They could also be established from secondary sources such as cryopreserved cultures (cultures frozen after previous research).{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Growth medium===
[[File:Myoblasts.png|thumb|Myoblasts are one precursor to muscle cells, and their fibers are shown in yellow and nuclei shown in blue.|251x251px]]
Once cell lines are established, they are immersed in a culture media to induce them to proliferate. Culture media are typically formulated from basal media that provide cells with necessary carbohydrates, fats, proteins and salts. Once a cell consumes a sufficient amount, it divides and the population increases exponentially. Culture media can be supplemented with additives—for instance sera—that supply additional growth factors. Growth factors can be secreted proteins or steroids that are crucial in regulating cellular processes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Once differentiation begins, muscle fibres begin to contract and generate lactic acid. Cells' ability to absorb nutrients and proliferate in part depends on the pH of their environment. As lactic acid accumulates within the media, the environment will become progressively more acidic and falls below the optimal pH. As a result, culture media must be frequently refreshed. This helps refresh the concentration of nutrients from the basal media.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

===Scaffold===
[[File:Muscle Tissue Smooth (40087100000).jpg|thumb|Muscle tissue is developed from the growth medium and organized in a three-dimensional structure by the scaffold for end product.|258x258px]]
In the case of structured meat products—products that are characterized by their overall  configuration as well as cell type—cells must be seeded to scaffolds. Scaffolds are essentially molds meant to reflect and encourage the cells to organize into a larger structure. When cells develop ''in vivo'', they are influenced by their interactions with the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM). The ECM is the 3-dimensional mesh of [[glycoproteins]], [[collagen]] and [[enzymes]] responsible for transmitting mechanical and biochemical cues to the cell. Scaffolds need to simulate the characteristics of the ECM.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Key properties:

==== Porosity ====
Pores are minute openings on the surface of the scaffold. They can be created on the surface of the biomaterial in order to release cellular components that could interfere with tissue development. They also help diffuse gas and nutrients to the innermost layers of adherent cells which prevents developing a "necrotic center" (created when cells that are not in direct contact with the culture medium die due to a lack of nutrients).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Vascularization ====
Vascular tissue found in plants contains the organs responsible for internally transporting fluids. It forms natural topographies that provide a low cost way to promote cell alignment by replicating the natural physiological state of myoblasts. It may also help with gas and nutrient exchange.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Biochemical properties====
A scaffold's biochemical properties should be similar to those of the ECM. It must facilitate cell adhesion through textural qualities or chemical bonding. Additionally, it must produce the chemical cues that encourage cell differentiation. Alternatively, the material should be able to blend with other substances which have these functional qualities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Crystallinity ====
The degree of a material's crystallinity determines qualities such as rigidity. High crystallinity can be attributed to hydrogen bonding which in turn increases thermal stability, tensile strength (important for maintaining the scaffold's shape), water retention (important for hydrating the cells) and [[Young's modulus]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Degradation ====
Certain materials degrade into compounds that are beneficial to cells, although this degradation can also be irrelevant or detrimental. Degradation allows easy removal of the scaffold from the finished product leaving only animal tissue—thereby increasing its resemblance to ''in vivo'' meat. This degradation can be induced by exposure to certain enzymes which do not impact the muscle tissue.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Edibility ====
If scaffolds are unable to be removed from the animal tissue, they must be edible to ensure consumer safety. It would be beneficial if they were to be made out of nutritious ingredients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Since 2010, academic research groups and companies have emerged in order to identify raw materials that have the characteristics of suitable scaffolds.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Cellulose ====
[[Cellulose]] is the most abundant polymer in nature and provides the [[exoskeletons]] of plant leaves. Due to its abundance, it can be obtained at a relatively low cost. It is also versatile and biocompatible. Through a process called "decellularization", it is coated in a [[surfactant]] that creates pores. These pores release the plant's cellular components, and it becomes decellularized plant tissue. This material has been extensively studied by the Pelling and Gaudette Groups at [[University of Ottawa]] and [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]], respectively. Through cross-linking (forming [[covalent bonds]] between individual polymer chains to hold them together) the plant tissue's mechanical properties can be changed so that it more closely resembles muscle tissue. This can also be done by blending plant tissue with other materials. On the other hand, decellularized plant tissue typically lacks mammalian biochemical cues, so it needs to be coated with compensatory functional proteins. [[C2C12]] growth was not shown to change significantly between the bare scaffold and the same scaffold with a coating of collagen or [[gelatin]] proteins, however seeding efficiency (rate at which cells attach to the scaffold) improved. An advantage of decellularized plant tissue is the natural topography afforded by the leaf vasculature. This helps replicate the natural physiological state of the myoblasts which promotes cell alignment. The other ways of doing this are usually quite a bit more expensive including 3d printing, soft lithography and photolithography. Vascularization can also help overcome the 100–200&amp;nbsp;nm diffusion limit of culture medium into cells that usually produce necrotic centres in muscle conglomerates. Another way to do this is by having a porous scaffold which supports [[angiogenesis]] (the development of new blood vessels). While this has been shown to work for Apple [[Hypanthium]], not all plants are nearly as porous. The alternative to plant cellulose is bacterial cellulose which is typically more pure than plant cellulose as it is free from contaminants such as [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]]. Bacterial cellulose has more hydrogen bonding between its polymer strands and so it has greater crystallinity. It also has smaller [[microfibrils]] that allow it to retain more moisture and have smaller pores. The substance can be produced using waste carbohydrates (which may allow it to be produced less expensively) and it adds juiciness and chewiness to emulsified meat (which would mean that even if it can't be taken out of the final product, it will contribute to the texture profile).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Campuzano|first1=Santiago|last2=Pelling|first2=Andrew E.|date=2019|title=Scaffolds for 3D Cell Culture and Cellular Agriculture Applications Derived From Non-animal Sources|journal=Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems|language=en|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fsufs.2019.00038|s2cid=157058210|issn=2571-581X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Adamski|first1=Michal|last2=Fontana|first2=Gianluca|last3=Gershlak|first3=Joshua R.|last4=Gaudette|first4=Glenn R.|last5=Le|first5=Hau D.|last6=Murphy|first6=William L.|date=2018-05-31|title=Two Methods for Decellularization of Plant Tissues for Tissue Engineering Applications|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments |issue=135|doi=10.3791/57586|issn=1940-087X|pmc=6101437|pmid=29912197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chitin ====
[[Chitin]] is nature's second most abundant polymer. It is found in the exoskeletons of [[crustaceans]] and [[fungi]]. As cellular agriculture is attempting to end reliance on animals, chitin derived from fungi is of greater interest. It has mostly been studied by Pelling Group. [[Chitosan]] is derived from chitin in a process known as alkaline deacetylation (substituting out certain [[amino acid]] groups). The degree of this process determines the physical and chemical properties of the chitosan. Chitosan has antibacterial properties; in particular, it has bactericidal effects on [[plankton]]ic bacteria and [[biofilms]] and a bacteria static effects on [[gram negative bacteria|gram negative]] bacteria such as ''[[E. coli]]''. This is important as it neutralizes potentially harmful compounds without using [[antibiotics]], which many consumers avoid. Chitosan's resemblance to [[glycosaminoglycans]] and internal interactions between glycoproteins and [[proteoglycans]] make it highly biocompatible. It can easily blend with other polymers in order to select for more bioactive factors. One potential disadvantage of chitosan is that it degrades in the presence of [[lysozymes]] (naturally occurring enzymes). But, this can be resisted using [[Acetylation|deacetylation]]. This is not entirely negative, as the byproducts produced through degradation have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. It is important to match the level that cells rely on the matrix for structure with degradation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Collagen ====
[[Collagen]] is a family of proteins that makes up the primary structure of human connective tissue. It is typically derived from bovine, porcine and [[Murinae|murine]] sources. Cellular agriculture overcomes this dependency through the use of transgenic organisms that are capable of producing the amino acid repeats that make up the collagen. Collagen naturally exists as collagen type I. It has been produced as porous hydrogels, composites and substrates with topographical cues and biochemical properties. Synthetic kinds of collagen have been produced through recombinant protein production—collagen type II and III, [[tropoelastin]] and [[fibronectin]]. One challenge with these proteins is that they can not be modified post translation. However, an alternative fibrillar protein has been isolated in microbes that lack collagen's biochemical cues, but has its kind of gene customizability. One focus of recombinant collagen production is yield optimization—how it can be produced most effectively. Plants, in particular, tobacco look like the best option, however, bacteria and yeast are also viable alternatives.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Textured soy protein is a soy flour product often used in plant-based meat that supports the growth of bovine cells. Its spongy texture enables efficient cell seeding and its porosity encourages oxygen transfer. Additionally, it degrades during cell differentiation into compounds that are beneficial to certain cells.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Mycellium ====
[[Mycelium]] are the roots of mushrooms. Altast Foods Co. is using solid state fermentation to grow mushroom tissue on mycelium scaffolds. They harvest this tissue and use it to create bacon analogs.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Atlast Food Co.|url=https://www.atlastfood.co/|access-date=2020-10-18|website=Atlast Food Co.|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nanomaterials ====
[[Nanomaterials]] exhibit unique properties at the [[nanoscale]]. London-based Biomimetic Solutions is leveraging nanomaterials in order to create scaffolds.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ben-Arye|first1=Tom|last2=Shandalov|first2=Yulia|last3=Ben-Shaul|first3=Shahar|last4=Landau|first4=Shira|last5=Zagury|first5=Yedidya|last6=Ianovici|first6=Iris|last7=Lavon|first7=Neta|last8=Levenberg|first8=Shulamit|date=April 2020|title=Textured soy protein scaffolds enable the generation of three-dimensional bovine skeletal muscle tissue for cell-based meat|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-0046-5|journal=Nature Food|language=en|volume=1|issue=4|pages=210–220|doi=10.1038/s43016-020-0046-5|s2cid=216199677|issn=2662-1355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cass Materials in Perth, Australia is using a dietary fibre called Nata de Coco (derived from coconuts) to create nanocellulose sponges for their BNC scaffold. Nata de Coco is biocompatible, has high porosity, facilitates cell adhesion and is biodegradable.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cass Materials|url=https://cassmaterials.com/|access-date=2020-10-18|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spinning ====
Immersion Jet Spinning is a method of creating scaffolds by spinning polymers into fibres, It was developed by the Parker Group at Harvard. Their platform uses centrifugal force to extrude a polymer solution through an opening in a rotating reservoir. During extrusion, the solution forms a jet that elongates and aligns as it crosses the air gap. The jet is directed into a vortex-controlled precipitation bath that chemically cross links or precipitates polymer nanofibers. Adjusting air gap, rotation and the solution changes the diameter of the resulting fibres. This method can spin scaffolds out of PPTA, nylon, DNA and nanofiber sheets. A nanofibrous scaffold made from [[alginate]] and gelatin was able to support the growth of C2C12 cells. Rabbit and bovine aortic smooth muscle myoblasts were able to adhere to the gelatin fibres. They formed aggregates on shorter fibres, and aligned tissue on the longer ones.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Grant M.|last2=MacQueen|first2=Luke A.|last3=Lind|first3=Johan U.|last4=Fitzgibbons|first4=Stacey A.|last5=Chantre|first5=Christophe O.|last6=Huggler|first6=Isabelle|last7=Golecki|first7=Holly M.|last8=Goss|first8=Josue A.|last9=Parker|first9=Kevin Kit|date=2017|title=Production of Synthetic, Para-Aramid and Biopolymer Nanofibers by Immersion Rotary Jet-Spinning|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mame.201600365|journal=Macromolecular Materials and Engineering|volume=302|issue=1|pages=1600365|doi=10.1002/mame.201600365|issn=1439-2054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrix Meats is using [[electrospinning]]—a process that uses electric force to turn charged polymers into fibres for scaffolds. Their scaffolds allowed meat marbling, are compatible with multiple cell lines, and are scalable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Matrix Meats|url=https://www.matrixmeats.com/|access-date=2020-10-18|website=Matrix Meats|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additive manufacturing===
[[File:Assembly of fibrous muscle, fat, and vascular tissues to cultured steak.webp|thumb|[[Bioprinting]] that assembles cell fibers could be used to produce a variety of steak-like cultured meat.&lt;ref name="10.1038/s41467-021-25236-9"/&gt;]]
Another proposed way of structuring muscle tissue is [[additive manufacturing]]. Such a technique was perfected for industrial applications in manufacturing objects made out of plastic, nylon, metal, glass and other synthetic materials. The most common variation of the process involves incrementally depositing a filament in layers onto a bed until the object is completed. This method will most likely lend itself best to the application of cultured meat as opposed to other types such as binder jetting, material jetting or stereolithography that require a specific kind of resin or powder.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

A filament of muscle cells can be printed into a structure meant to resemble a finished meat product which can then be further processed for cell maturation. This technique has been demonstrated in a collaboration between 3D bioprinting solutions and Aleph Farms that used additive manufacturing to structure turkey cells on the International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://meatech3d.com/|title=Home|work=[[MeaTech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[3D bioprinting]] has been used to produce steak-like cultured meat, composed of three types of bovine cell fibers and with a structure of assembled of cell fibers that is similar to original meat.&lt;ref name="10.1038/s41467-021-25236-9"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=Dong-Hee |last2=Louis |first2=Fiona |last3=Liu |first3=Hao |last4=Shimoda |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Nishiyama |first5=Yasutaka |last6=Nozawa |first6=Hajime |last7=Kakitani |first7=Makoto |last8=Takagi |first8=Daisuke |last9=Kasa |first9=Daijiro |last10=Nagamori |first10=Eiji |last11=Irie |first11=Shinji |last12=Kitano |first12=Shiro |last13=Matsusaki |first13=Michiya |title=Engineered whole cut meat-like tissue by the assembly of cell fibers using tendon-gel integrated bioprinting |journal=Nature Communications |date=24 August 2021 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=5059 |doi=10.1038/s41467-021-25236-9 |pmid=34429413 |language=en |issn=2041-1723|pmc=8385070 |bibcode=2021NatCo..12.5059K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japanese scientists produce first 3D-bioprinted, marbled Wagyu beef |url=https://newatlas.com/science/world-first-lab-grown-wagyu-beef-japan/ |access-date=21 September 2021 |work=New Atlas |date=25 August 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioreactors ===
[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|252x252px|Potential bioreactor configuration for cultured meat]]
Scaffolds are placed inside bioreactors so that cell growth and specialization can occur. Bioreactors are large machines similar to brewery tanks which expose the cells to a large variety of environmental factors that are necessary to promote either proliferation or differentiation. The temperature of the bioreactor must replicate ''in vivo'' conditions. In the case of mammalian cells, this requires heating to 37&amp;nbsp;°C (99&amp;nbsp;°F). Alternatively, insect cells can be grown at room temperature. Most bioreactors are maintained at 5% carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rubio|first1=Natalie R.|last2=Fish|first2=Kyle D.|last3=Trimmer|first3=Barry A.|last4=Kaplan|first4=David L.|date=2019|title=Possibilities for Engineered Insect Tissue as a Food Source|journal=Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems|language=en|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fsufs.2019.00024|issn=2571-581X|doi-access=free|s2cid=116877741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells can either be cultivated in continuous or fed-batch systems. The former entails inoculating and harvesting cells in a constant process so that there are always cells in the bioreactor. Fed-batch systems mean inoculating the cells, culturing them and harvesting them in a single period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Stirred tank bioreactors are the most widely used configuration. An impeller increases the flow, thereby homogenizing the culture media and a diffuser facilitates the exchange of oxygen into the media. This system is generally used for suspended cultures but can be used for cells that require attachment to another surface if microcarriers are included. Fixed bed bioreactors are commonly used for adherent cultures. They feature strips of fibres that are packed together to form a bed to which cells can attach. Aerated culture media is circulated through the bed. In airlift bioreactors, the culture media is aerated into a gaseous form using air bubbles which are then scattered and dispersed amongst the cells. Perfusion bioreactors are common configurations for continuous cultivation. They continuously drain media saturated with lactic acid that is void of nutrients and fill it with replenished media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What Are the Different Types of Bioreactors? - Biotech Blog|url=https://www.pall.com/en/biotech/blog/types-of-bioreactor.html#:~:text=March%2011,%202020,be%20sterilized%20in%20an%20autoclave.|access-date=2020-10-19|website=www.pall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fermentation ===
The elements outlined above apply to the cultivation of animal muscle tissue. However, [[cellular agriculture]] includes "acellular agriculture", which involves the production of animal products synthesized of non-living material.{{Clarify|reason=cellular explicitly does not contain acellular!|date=July 2021}} Such products include milk, honey, eggs, cheese, and gelatin which are made of various proteins rather than cells. In such cases, these proteins must be fermented much like in recombinant protein production, alcohol brewing and the generation of many plant-based products like tofu, tempeh and sauerkraut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=August 16, 2016|title=What is Cellular Agriculture?|url=https://www.new-harvest.org/what_is_cellular_agriculture|access-date=2020-10-28|website=New Harvest|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Impossible Burger - Gott's Roadside- 2018 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|316x316px|The Impossible Burger was made with fermented heme proteins.]]
Proteins are coded for by specific genes, the genes coding for the protein of interest are synthesized into a [[plasmid]]—a closed loop of double helical genetic information. This plasmid, called [[recombinant DNA]], is then inserted into a bacterial specimen. For this to happen, the bacteria needs to be competent (i.e. able to accept foreign, extracellular DNA) and able to horizontally transfer genes (i.e. integrate the foreign genes into its own DNA). Horizontal gene transfer is significantly more challenging in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms than [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms because the former have both a cell membrane and a nuclear membrane which the plasmid needs to penetrate whereas prokaryotic organisms only have a cell membrane. For this reason, prokaryotic bacteria are often favoured. In order to make such a bacteria temporarily competent, it can be exposed to a salt such as [[calcium chloride]], which neutralizes the negative charges on the cell membrane's [[phosphate]] heads as well as the negative charges on the plasmid to prevent the two from repelling. The bacteria can incubate in warm water, opening large pores on the cell surface through which the plasmid can enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CaCl2 Transformation Technique|url=https://www.mybiosource.com/learn/testing-procedures/cacl2-transformation-technique/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=MyBioSource Learning Center|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, the bacteria is fermented in sugar, which encourages it to grow and duplicate. In the process it expresses its DNA as well as the transferred plasmid resulting in protein.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Finally, the solution is purified to separate out the residual protein. This can be done by introducing an [[antibody]] raised against the protein of interest that will kill bacteria cells that do not contain the protein. Through centrifugation, the solution can be spun around an axis with sufficient force to separate solids from liquids. Alternatively it could be soaked in a buffered ionic solution that employs [[osmosis]] to leach the water from bacteria and kill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=Paul T.|date=2015-04-01|title=Overview of the Purification of Recombinant Proteins|journal=Current Protocols in Protein Science |volume=80|pages=6.1.1–6.1.35|doi=10.1002/0471140864.ps0601s80|issn=1934-3655|pmc=4410719|pmid=25829302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

=== Growth factors ===
The culture media is an essential component of ''in vitro'' cultivation. It is responsible for providing the macromolecules, nutrients and growth factors necessary for cell proliferation. Sourcing growth factors is one of the most challenging tasks of cellular agriculture. Traditionally, it involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) which is a blood product extracted from fetal cows. Besides the argument that its production is unethical, it is also vitiates the independence of the use of animals. It is also the most costly constituent of cultured meat, priced at around $1000 per litre. Furthermore, chemical composition varies greatly depending on the animal, so it cannot be uniformly quantified chemically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dessels|first1=Carla|last2=Potgieter|first2=Marnie|last3=Pepper|first3=Michael S.|date=2016|title=Making the Switch: Alternatives to Fetal Bovine Serum for Adipose-Derived Stromal Cell Expansion|journal=Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology|language=en|volume=4|page=115|doi=10.3389/fcell.2016.00115|pmid=27800478|pmc=5065960|issn=2296-634X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBS is employed because it conveniently mimics the process of muscle development ''in vivo''. The growth factors needed for tissue development are predominantly provided through an animal's bloodstream, and no other known fluid can single-handedly deliver all these components.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The current alternative is to generate each growth factor individually using recombinant protein production. In this process, the genes coding for the specific factor are integrated into bacteria which are then fermented. However, due to the added complexity of this process, it is particularly expensive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Future Fields, a Canadian company focused on overcoming the economic and environmental costs of traditional growth media, is developing serum-free growth factors from fruit flies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Future Fields Cellular Agriculture &amp; Biomanufacturing|url=https://www.futurefields.io/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=www.futurefields.io|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal medium would be chemically quantifiable and accessible to ensure simplicity in production, cheap and not dependent on animals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It will most likely be derived from plants and while this may reduce the possibility of transmitting infectious agents, it may induce allergic reactions in some consumers.&lt;ref&gt;I. Datar, M. Betti, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222521883_Possibilities_for_an_in_vitro_meat_production_system Possibilities for an in vitro meat production system], Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies 11 (2010) at 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Such culture sera may also require modifications specific to the cell line to which it is applied. Companies currently invested in developing effective plant based culture includes Multus Media and Biftek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Multus {{!}} feeding food|url=https://www.multus.media/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=multus.media|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=biftek.co|url=https://biftek.co/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=biftek.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Good Food Institute]] (GFI) put out a report in 2019 in support of the concept that cell-based ''meat'' could be produced at the same cost as ground beef and in 2021 they commissioned a report from [[CE Delft]] on the Techno-Economic Analysis of cultivated meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=TEA of cultivated meat. Future projections for different scenarios|url=https://cedelft.eu/publications/tea-of-cultivated-meat/|access-date=2022-01-07|website=CE Delft - EN|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is to subject the cell lines to a magnetic field, which stimulates the release of molecules that have regenerative, metabolic, anti-inflammatory and immunity-boosting properties, eliminating the need for serum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Andrei |first=Mihai |date=2022-10-04 |title=New technique from Singapore makes lab-grown meat cheaper, greener, and more ethical |url=https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/nutrition-medicine/singapore-lab-meat-03102022/ |access-date=2022-10-12 |website=ZME Science |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface area ===
A common challenge to bioreactors and scaffolds is developing system configurations that enable all cells to gain exposure to culture media while simultaneously optimizing spatial requirements. In the cell proliferation phase, prior to the introduction of the scaffold, many cell types need to be attached to a surface to support growth. As such, cells must be grown in confluent monolayers only one cell thick which necessitates a lot of surface area. This poses practical challenges on large scales. As such, systems may incorporate microcarriers—small spherical beads of glass or other compatible material that are suspended in the culture medium. Cells adhere to these microcarriers as they would to the sides of the bioreactor, which increases the amount of surface area.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title=How it's made: the science behind cultivated meat|url=http://elliotswartz.com/cellbasedmeat/cleanmeat301|access-date=2020-10-19|website=A Bit of Science|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cell differentiation phase, the cells may be seeded to a scaffold and so do not require the use of microcarriers. However, in these instances, the density of the cells on the scaffold means that not all cells have an interface with culture media, leading to cell death and necrotic centers within the meat. When muscle is cultivated ''in vivo'', this issue is circumvented as the extracellular matrix delivers nutrients into the muscle through blood vessels. As such, many emerging scaffolds aim to replicate such networks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Similarly, scaffolds must simulate many of the other characteristics of the extracellular matrix, most notably porosity, crystallinity, degradation, biocompatibility and functionality. Few materials that emulate all these characteristics have been identified, leading to the possibility of blending different materials with complementary properties.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Research support ===
Cellular agriculture research does not have a significant basis of academic interest or funding streams.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Consequently, the majority of research has been undertaken and funded by independent institutions. However, this is incrementally changing as not for profits drive support and interest. Notably, New Harvest has a fellowship program to support graduate students and groups at various academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Harvest|url=https://www.new-harvest.org/|access-date=2020-10-19|website=New Harvest|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a growing number of governments are funding research in cellular agriculture. In August 2020, the Grant Management Services of the European Commission awarded a €2.5 million grant to ORF Genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Icelandic Biotech Firm Receives Large European Grant|url=https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2020/08/01/icelandic_biotech_firm_receives_large_european_gran/|access-date=2022-01-07|website=Iceland Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2020, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry granted Integriculture $2.2 million through their New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-08-28|title=IntegriCulture Awarded $2.2 Million Grant to Build New Commercial Cell Ag Facility|url=https://thespoon.tech/integriculture-awarded-2-2-million-grant-to-build-new-commercial-cell-ag-facility/|access-date=2022-01-07|website=The Spoon|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union’s Horizon 2020 R&amp;D funding framework awarded a €2.7 million grant to a consortium led by [[BioTech Foods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-10-14|title=EU's Horizon 2020 invests in cellular agriculture|url=https://www.foodfrontier.org/eus-horizon-2020-invests-in-cellular-agriculture/|access-date=2022-01-07|website=Food Frontier|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2021, the Spanish government granted €3.7 million for Biotech Foods to investigate the potential health benefits of cellular agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-01-22|title=BioTech Food tests on synthetic meat for € 5.2 million - Spanish government allocates 3.7 million for the project|url=https://www.efanews.eu/item/16394-biotech-food-tests-on-synthetic-meat-for-5-2-million.html|access-date=2022-01-07|website=EFA News - European Food Agency|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Science Foundation awarded a $3.55 million grant to a team of researchers at UC Davis for open-access cultured meat research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=UC Davis receives $3.55m grant to investigate long-term viability of cell-cultured meat|url=https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/09/28/UC-Davis-receives-3.55m-grant-to-investigate-long-term-viability-of-cell-cultured-meat|access-date=2022-01-07|website=foodnavigator-usa.com|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non profits also drive support and interest in the field. Notably, New Harvest has a fellowship program to support the research of specific graduate students and groups at various academic institutions and the Good Food Institute funds open-access research through its Research Grant Program.

=== Consumer acceptance ===
Consumer acceptance of the product is critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Shruti|last2=Thind|first2=Sukhcharanjit Singh|last3=Kaur|first3=Amarjeet|date=December 2015|title=In vitro meat production system: why and how?|journal=Journal of Food Science and Technology|language=en|volume=52|issue=12|pages=7599–7607|doi=10.1007/s13197-015-1972-3|issn=0022-1155|pmc=4648904|pmid=26604337}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study looking at acceptance of cultured meat in China, India, and the US "found high levels of acceptance of clean meat in the three most populous countries worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Christopher|last2=Szejda|first2=Keri|last3=Parekh|first3=Nishant|last4=Desphande|first4=Varun|last5=Tse|first5=Brian|date=27 February 2019|title=A Survey of Consumer Perceptions of Plant-Based and Clean Meat in the USA, India, and China|journal=Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems|volume=3|pages=11|doi=10.3389/fsufs.2019.00011|issn=2571-581X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several potential factors of consumer acceptance of cultured meat have been identified. Healthiness, safety, nutritional characteristics, sustainability, taste, and lower price, are all contributing factors.&lt;ref name="Gómez-Luciano 103732"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gómez-Luciano|first1=Cristino Alberto|last2=de Aguiar|first2=Luis Kluwe|last3=Vriesekoop|first3=Frank|last4=Urbano|first4=Beatriz|date=December 2019|title=Consumers' willingness to purchase three alternatives to meat proteins in the United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil and the Dominican Republic|journal=Food Quality and Preference|language=en|volume=78|pages=103732|doi=10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.103732|s2cid=198753926|url=https://hau.repository.guildhe.ac.uk/17416/1/Frank%20Vriesekoop%20consumers%20willingness%20upload.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the use of highly technical language to explain cultured meat led to significantly more negative public attitude towards the concept.&lt;ref name="Bryant 103"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Christopher|last2=Dillard|first2=Courtney|date=3 July 2019|title=The Impact of Framing on Acceptance of Cultured Meat|journal=Frontiers in Nutrition|volume=6|pages=103|doi=10.3389/fnut.2019.00103|issn=2296-861X|pmc=6616100|pmid=31334244|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparently communicating the science is important, but ''oversharing'' the wrong aspects of the product could draw unfavourable attention to safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3.4.

Although the 'lab-grown meat' portrayal of cultivated meat is favoured by media, it has been opposed by industry leaders as it seeds an innately unnatural image of cultivated meat in consumer's perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3.6.

The use of standardized descriptions would improve future research about consumer acceptance of cultured meat. Current studies have often reported drastically different rates of acceptance, despite similar survey populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Christopher|last2=Barnett|first2=Julie|date=September 2018|title=Consumer acceptance of cultured meat: A systematic review|journal=Meat Science|language=en|volume=143|pages=8–17|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.04.008|pmid=29684844|s2cid=19086898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lou Cooperhouse, CEO of BlueNalu, shared on the ''Red to Green Podcast'' that "cell-based" and "cell-cultured" were suitable terms to differentiate it from conventional meat whilst being clear about the process by which it was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3.7.

For example, in the United States there is no overarching federal legislation that regulates how cultured meat should be labeled for the consumer. While traditional meat producers are attempting to prevent cultured meat companies from using the term "meat," cultured meat producers argue that the word is necessary for consumer acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Spring |first=Alexandra |last2=Bence |first2=Cydnee |date=October 18, 2022 |title=WHAT’S THE BEEF?

Global market acceptance has not been assessed. Studies are attempting to determine the current levels of consumer acceptance and identify methods to improve this value. Clear answers are not available, although one recent study reported that consumers were willing to pay a premium for cultured meat.&lt;ref name="Gómez-Luciano 103732"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant 103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegrist 213–219"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Anderson|first2=Joanna E.|last3=Asher|first3=Kathryn E.|last4=Green|first4=Che|last5=Gasteratos|first5=Kristopher|date=August 2019|title=Strategies for overcoming aversion to unnaturalness: The case of clean meat|journal=Meat Science|language=en|volume=154|pages=37–45|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.04.004|pmid=30986669|s2cid=117717742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Barnett|first2=Julie C.|date=June 2019|title=What's in a name?

Low percentages of older adult populations have been reported to show acceptance for cultured meat. Green eating behavior, educational status, and food business, were cited as most important factors for this population.&lt;ref name="Grasso 1904" /&gt;

There is also a lack of studies relating the methods of producing cultured meat with its taste for the consuming public.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

=== Regulations ===
Singapore became the first country in the world to approve cultured meat for sale in 2020. The Singapore Food Agency has published guidance on its requirements for the safety assessment of novel foods, including specific requirements on the information to be submitted for approval of cultivated meat products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SFA|url=https://www.sfa.gov.sg/docs/default-source/food-import-and-export/Requirements-on-safety-assessment-of-novel-foods_23-Nov-2020.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201204111427/https://www.sfa.gov.sg/docs/default-source/food-import-and-export/Requirements-on-safety-assessment-of-novel-foods_23-Nov-2020.pdf |archive-date=4 December 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulatory matters must also be sorted out. Prior to being available for sale, the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Canada]] require approved novel food applications. Additionally, the European Union requires that cultured animal products and production must prove safety, by an approved company application, as of 1 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=N|date=July 21, 2018|title=Bringing cultured meat to market: Technical, socio-political, and regulatory challenges in cellular agriculture.|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|volume=78|pages=155–166|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2018.04.010|pmid=30100674|pmc=6078906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] (Food and Drug Administration) and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] (United States Department of Agriculture) have agreed to jointly regulate cultured meat.

Researchers have suggested that [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s could be added to cultured meat as a health bonus.&lt;ref name="australian" /&gt; In a similar way, the [[omega-3]] fatty acid content of conventional meat can be increased by altering what the animals are fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Azcona | first1 = J.O. | last2 = Schang | first2 = M.J. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = P.T. | last4 = Gallinger | first4 = C. | last5 = Ayerza | first5 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Omega-3 enriched broiler meat: The influence of dietary alpha-linolenic omega-3 fatty acid sources on growth, performance and meat fatty acid composition | journal = Canadian Journal of Animal Science, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada | volume = 88 | issue = 2| pages = 257–269 | doi = 10.4141/cjas07081 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is currently underway in Spain to develop cultivated meat with healthier fats, which could reduce cholesterol and the risk of colon cancer typically associated with red meat consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Spanish government invests €5.2 million in cultured meat project|url=https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/01/20/Spanish-government-invests-5.2-million-in-cultured-meat-project|access-date=2022-01-12|website=foodnavigator.com|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine suggested that the cell-cultured process may also decrease exposure of the meat to bacteria and disease.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

Due to the strictly controlled and predictable environment, cultured meat production has been compared to [[vertical farming]]. Some of its proponents have predicted that it will have similar benefits in terms of reducing exposure to dangerous chemicals like pesticides and fungicides, severe injuries, and wildlife.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I |publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |access-date= 26 June 2009 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091951/http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |archive-date= 1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a lack of research on the comparison on the health effects of production cultured meat with the industrial meat or the biologic organic meat ways of production.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

===Artificiality===
Although cultured meat consists of animal muscle cells, fat and support cells, as well as blood vessels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.dezeen.com/2018/12/18/lab-grown-steak-beef-slaughter-free-aleph-farms-design/ |title = World's first lab-grown steak is made from beef but slaughter-free|date = 18 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are the same as in traditional meat, some consumers may find the high-tech production process unacceptable.

If a cultured meat product is different in [[Visual appearance|appearance]], [[taste]], [[odor|smell]], [[Texture (food)|texture]], or other factors, it may not be commercially competitive with conventionally produced meat. The lack of bone and cardiovascular system is a disadvantage for dishes where these parts make appreciable culinary contributions. However, the lack of bones and/or blood may make many traditional meat preparations, such as [[buffalo wing]]s, more palatable to some people. Furthermore, blood and bones could potentially be cultured in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/lab-grown-blood-be-trialed-uk/|title=Lab-Grown Blood To Be Trialled in the U.K.|website=IFLScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lab-grown-bone-biomedical-engineering-osteoporosis-amputees|title=How do you grow bone in a lab?

Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the facility into [[biogas]] which is generally composed of 65% methane. This biogas could be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse or a series of bioreactors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdi.ce.cmu.edu/gd/education/landfill-case.pdf Case Study&amp;nbsp;– Landfill Power Generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061623/http://gdi.ce.cmu.edu/gd/education/landfill-case.pdf |date=3 December 2008 }}, H.

One study reported that cultured meat was "potentially ... much more efficient and environmentally-friendly".

On the other hand, producing the same quantity of meat ''in vitro'' has "7–45% lower energy use... 78–96% lower GHG emissions, 99% lower land use, and 82–96% lower water use".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuomisto|first=Hanna|date=17 June 2011|title=Environmental Impacts of Cultured Meat Production|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es200130u|access-date=November 12, 2020|volume=45|issue=14|pages=6117–6123|doi=10.1021/es200130u|pmid=21682287|bibcode=2011EnST...45.6117T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest study by independent research firm CE Delft shows that—compared with conventional beef—cultured meat may cause up to 92% less greenhouse gas emissions if renewable energy is used in the production process, 93% less pollution, up to 95% less land use and 78% less water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CE_Delft_LCA_of_cultivated_meat.pdf|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ao1IYCiIj8CM5EikPXF8PLo33mAiSnDJ/view?usp=embed_facebook|access-date=2022-01-12|website=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic Margaret Mellon of the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] speculates that the energy and fossil fuel requirements of large-scale cultured meat production may be more environmentally destructive than producing food off the land.&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt; However, S.L. Davis speculated that both vertical farming in urban areas and the activity of cultured meat facilities may cause relatively little harm to the wildlife that live around the facilities.&lt;ref name="sldavis"&gt;{{cite conference | author=S.L.

===Role of genetic modification===
Techniques of [[genetic engineering]], such as insertion, deletion, silencing, activation, or mutation of a gene, are not required to produce cultured meat. Cultured meat production allows the biological processes that normally occur within an animal to occur without the animal. Since cultured meat is grown in a controlled, artificial environment, some have commented that cultured meat more closely resembles hydroponic vegetables, rather than [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] vegetables.&lt;ref name="test tube meat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandhana|first=Lakshmi|title=Test Tube Meat Nears Dinner Table|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/06/71201|access-date=27 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819005637/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/06/71201|archive-date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More research is underway on cultured meat, and although cultured meat does not require genetic engineering, researchers may employ such techniques to improve quality and sustainability. Fortifying cultured meat with nutrients such as beneficial fatty acids is one improvement that can be facilitated through genetic modification. The same improvement can be made without genetic modification, by manipulating the conditions of the culture medium.&lt;ref name="Method for producing tissue engineered meat for consumption"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vein|first=John|title=Patent US6835390|url=https://www.google.ca/patents/US6835390?dq=ininventor:%22Jon+Vein%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-lnMUtX4DOTI2AWt_IGYCA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAzge|access-date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic modification may be able to enhance muscle cell proliferation. The introduction of myogenic regulatory factors, growth factors, or other gene products into muscle cells may increase production over that of conventional meat.&lt;ref name="Method for producing tissue engineered meat for consumption"/&gt;

To avoid the use of any animal products, the use of photosynthetic [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] has been proposed to produce the main ingredients for the culture media, as opposed to fetal bovine or horse serum.&lt;ref name="Universiteit Utrecht"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haagsman|first=H.P.|author2=K.J.

Australian bioethicist [[Julian Savulescu]] said, "Artificial meat stops cruelty to animals, is better for the environment, could be safer and more efficient, and even healthier.

Alvaro proposes a virtue-oriented approach, suggesting that the determination to produce cultured meat stems from unvirtuous motives, i.e., "lack of temperance and misunderstanding of the role of food in human flourishing."&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro, C. (2019) Lab‐Grown Meat and Veganism: A Virtue‐Oriented Perspective. ''J Agric Environ Ethics''. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10806-019-09759-2, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have proposed independent inquiries into the standards, laws, and regulations for cultured meat.&lt;ref name="inquiries"&gt;[http://www.foodethicscouncil.org/topic/In%20vitro%20meat ''In vitro'' meat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121015931/http://www.foodethicscouncil.org/topic/In%20vitro%20meat |date=21 November 2011 }} at Food Ethics Council&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as with many other foods, cultured meat needs technically sophisticated production methods that may be difficult for some communities, meaning they would lack self-sufficiency and be dependent on global food corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.new-harvest.org/2013/07/in-vitro-meat-power-authenticity-and-vegetarianism-john-miller/ |title=In Vitro Meat: Power, Authenticity and Vegetarianism |access-date=5 August 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130805104702/http://www.new-harvest.org/2013/07/in-vitro-meat-power-authenticity-and-vegetarianism-john-miller/ |archive-date=5 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some projects are focusing on making cell ag accessible to all. The open source cellular agriculture initiative Shojinmeat Project has for instance a bottom-up approach, teaching members of the project to cultivate DIY cultured meat at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-04-16|title=Shojinmeat is Growing a DIY Clean Meat Community|url=https://thespoon.tech/shojinmeat-is-growing-a-diy-clean-meat-community/|access-date=2022-01-12|website=The Spoon|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing a similar parallel with cultured meat, some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change. [[Environmentalist]] Dave Riley states that "being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us", and notes that Mollison "insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/5814|title= Does meat make the meal?|date= 2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious considerations ===
[[Judaism|Jewish]] rabbinical authorities disagree whether cultured meat is [[kosher]], meaning acceptable under Jewish law and practice. One factor is the nature of the animal from which the cells are sourced, whether it is a kosher or non-kosher species and whether, if the cells were taken from a dead animal, slaughter in accordance with religious practice had taken place prior to the extraction of cells. Most authorities agree that if the original cells were taken from a religiously slaughtered animal then the meat cultured from it will be kosher.&lt;ref name="kenigsberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kenigsberg |first1=Joel |last2=Zivotofsky |first2=Ari |date=January 22, 2020 |title=A Jewish Religious Perspective on Cellular Agriculture |journal=Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems |volume=3 |doi=10.3389/fsufs.2019.00128 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the nature of the cells, it may be determined to be kosher even when taken from a live animal, and some have argued that it would be kosher even if coming from non-kosher animals such as pigs.&lt;ref name="kosher22"/&gt;

[[Islam]]ic dietary practices must also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hamdan|first1=Mohammad Naqib|last2=Post|first2=Mark J.|last3=Ramli|first3=Mohd Anuar|last4=Mustafa|first4=Amin Rukaini|date=1 December 2018|title=Cultured Meat in Islamic Perspective|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|language=en|volume=57|issue=6|pages=2193–2206|doi=10.1007/s10943-017-0403-3|pmid=28456853|s2cid=9217711|issn=1573-6571}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Institute of Orange County, California, said, "There does not appear to be any objection to eating this type of cultured meat."&lt;ref name="But Is It Kosher"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lab-burger-kosher-halal_n_3733851|title=But Is It Kosher?|date=9 August 2013|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=5 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Abdul Qahir Qamar of the [[International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah|International Islamic Fiqh Academy]] said that cultured meat "will not be considered meat from live animals, but will be cultured meat." As long as the cells are not from pigs, dogs, and other [[haram]] animals, the meat would be considered vegetative and "similar to yogurt and fermented pickles."&lt;ref name="But Is It Kosher"/&gt;

[[Hinduism]] typically excludes the consumption of beef, such as steak and burgers. Chandra Kaushik, president of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]], said about cultured beef that he would "not accept it being traded in a marketplace in any form or being used for a commercial purpose."&lt;ref name="But Is It Kosher"/&gt;

[[Catholicism]], which excludes eating meat in certain days along the year (Lent, Holy Week), has not pronounced on whether cultivated meat is banned (as it happens with meat) or not (as with any other food as vegetables or fish).

=== Economic ===
At the moment, cultured meat is significantly more costly than conventional meat. However, in a March 2015 interview, Post said that the marginal cost of his team's original €250,000 burger was now €8.00. He estimated that technological advancements would allow the product to be cost-competitive to traditionally sourced beef in approximately ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Post|first1=Mark|date=26 March 2015|title=Mark Post of Maastricht University in the Netherlands has developed synthetic beef patties.|work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-27/mark-post-synthetic-beef/6352860|access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Memphis Meats reduced the cost of production to $1,700 per pound.&lt;ref name="Dart" /&gt; In 2019, Eat Just said it cost about US$50 to produce one chicken nugget.&lt;ref name="Morrison2020"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morrison |first1=Oliver |title='A major milestone for lab-grown meat': Could Eat Just's approval in Asia hurry the market in Europe? |url=https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2020/12/04/A-major-milestone-for-lab-grown-meat-Could-Eat-Just-s-approval-in-Asia-hurry-the-market-in-Europe |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=foodnavigator.com |publisher=William Reed Business Media |date=4 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company’s cultured chicken nuggets, now available at Singapore restaurant 1880, cost around US$17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gilchrist|first=Karen|date=2021-03-01|title=This multibillion-dollar company is selling lab-grown chicken in a world-first|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/eat-just-good-meat-sells-lab-grown-cultured-chicken-in-world-first.html|access-date=2022-01-12|website=CNBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by independent research firm CE Delft found that production costs for cultivated meat could fall to $5.66/kg by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=LCA of cultivated meat.

=== Farmers ===
A scientific paper published in ''Front. Sustain. Food Syst.'' addresses the social and economic opportunities and challenges of cultured and plant-based meat for rural producers. According to this research, cellular agriculture offers "opportunities such as growing crops as ingredients for feedstock for cultured meat; raising animals for genetic material for cultured meat; producing cultured meat in bioreactors at the farm level; transitioning into new sectors; new market opportunities for blended and hybrid animal- and alt-meat products; and new value around regenerative or high-animal welfare farming." However, some challenges are also identified, with possible "loss of livelihood or income for ranchers and livestock producers and for farmers growing crops for animal feed; barriers to transitioning into emerging alt-meat sectors; and the possibility of exclusion from those sectors." 
Some farmers already see the potential of cellular agriculture. For instance, Illtud Dunsford comes from a long line of farmers in Wales and established his cultured meat company Cellular Agriculture Ltd in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2019-03-19|title=Artificial meat: UK scientists growing 'bacon' in labs|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47611026|access-date=2022-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuing development ==

=== Education ===
In 2015, Maastricht University hosted the first International Conference on Cultured Meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference on Cultured Meat 2015|url=https://culturedbeef.org/pictures-conference-2015|access-date=10 April 2019|website=Cultured Beef}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Harvest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albrecht|first=Chris|date=20 July 2018|title=Catch Video from the New Harvest Cultured Meat Conference|work=The Spoon|url=https://thespoon.tech/catch-video-from-the-new-harvest-cultured-meat-conference/|access-date=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a 501(c)(3) research institute—as well as [[The Good Food Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good Food Conference|url=https://goodfoodconference.com/title=International|access-date=10 April 2019|website=The Good Food Conference}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; host annual conferences to convene industry leaders, scientists, investors, and potential collaborators. The two organizations also fund public research and produce educational content. Organizations such as the Cellular Agriculture Society, Cellular Agriculture Canada, Cellular Agriculture France, Cellular Agriculture Australia and Cellular agriculture New Zealand were founded to advocate for cultured meat in their respective countries. Publications such as Cell Agri and the Protein Report have also emerged in order to provide updates concerning the technology and business within the field.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Research ===
Research continues on many fronts, including [[entomoculture]], [[interactome]] maps of cardiac tissue,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Current Research Projects|url=https://www.new-harvest.org/current_research_projects|access-date=2020-10-21|website=New Harvest|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; substrate design,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; scaffold design,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; nutritional profile,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; reaction kinetics, transport phenomena, mass transfer limitations and metabolic stoichiometric requirements,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and bioprinting process.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Accelerators and incubators ===
Multiple venture capital firms and accelerator/incubator programs focus on assisting cultured technology startups, or plant-based protein companies in general. The Big Idea Ventures (BIV) Venture Capital firm launched their New Protein Fund to invest in emerging cell and plant-based food companies in New York and Singapore. They invested in [[MeliBio]], Actual Veggies, Biftek.co, Orbillion Bio, Yoconut, Evo, WildFor and Novel Farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-08-13|title=Meet the 13 Companies Chosen for Cohort II of Big Idea Ventures' Alt-Protein Accelerator|url=https://thespoon.tech/meet-the-13-companies-chosen-for-cohort-ii-of-big-idea-ventures-alt-protein-accelerator/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=The Spoon|language=en-US |first=Jennifer |last=Marston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indie Bio is a biology oriented accelerator program that has invested in Memphis Meats, Geltor, New Age Meats and Finless Foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Companies|url=https://indiebio.co/companies/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=IndieBio|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultured meat has often featured in [[science fiction]]. The earliest mention may be in ''[[Two Planets]]'' (1897) by [[Kurd Lasswitz]], where "synthetic meat" is one of the varieties of synthetic food introduced on Earth by Martians. Other notable books mentioning artificial meat include ''[[Ashes, Ashes]]'' (1943) by [[René Barjavel]]; ''[[The Space Merchants]]'' (1952) by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Cyril M. Kornbluth|C.M. Kornbluth]]; ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'' (1980) by [[Douglas Adams]]; ''[[Le Transperceneige|Le Transperceneige (Snowpiercer)]]'' (1982) by [[Jacques Lob]] and [[Jean-Marc Rochette]]; ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) by [[William Gibson]]; ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' (2003) by [[Margaret Atwood]]; ''[[Deadstock]]'' (2007) by [[Jeffrey Thomas (writer)|Jeffrey Thomas]]; ''[[Accelerando]]'' (2005) by [[Charles Stross]]; ''[[Ware Tetralogy]]'' by [[Rudy Rucker]]; ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]'' (2011) by [[Veronica Roth]]; and the [[Vorkosigan Saga]] (1986–2018) by [[Lois McMaster Bujold]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In film, artificial meat has featured prominently in [[Giulio Questi]]'s 1968 drama ''[[La morte ha fatto l'uovo]]'' (''Death Laid an Egg'') and [[Claude Zidi]]'s 1976 comedy ''[[L'aile ou la cuisse]]'' (''The Wing or the Thigh''). "Man-made" chickens also appear in [[David Lynch]]'s 1977 surrealist horror, ''[[Eraserhead]]''. Most recently, it was also featured prominently as the central theme of the movie ''[[Antiviral (film)|Antiviral]]'' (2012).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']] from the TV and movie franchise ''[[Star Trek]]'' apparently provides a synthetic meat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Trek 'Charlie X'}}&lt;/ref&gt; although crews from ''The Next Generation'' and later use [[Replicator (Star Trek)|replicators]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Better Off Ted]]'' (2009–2010), the episode "[[List of Better Off Ted episodes#ep2|Heroes]]" features Phil ([[Jonathan Slavin]]) and Lem ([[Malcolm Barrett (actor)|Malcolm Barrett]]) trying to grow cowless beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fresco |first=Michael |title=Heroes |date=2009-03-25 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1402241/ |series=Better Off Ted |access-date=2022-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the videogame ''[[Project Eden (video game)|Project Eden]]'', the player characters investigate a cultured meat company called Real Meat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In the movie ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'' during the dinner scene, [[Tim Allen]]'s character refers to his steak tasting like "real Iowa beef".{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In ''[[The Expanse (novel series)|The Expanse]]'' "vat-grown" meat is produced to feed the people who live on spaceships/space stations away from Earth, due to the exorbitant cost of importing real meat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Cultured meat was a subject on an episode of the [[Colbert Report]] on 17 March 2009.&lt;ref name="Colbert-shmeat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/bsv6p7/the-colbert-report-world-of-nahlej---shmeat |title=The Colbert Report: World of Nahlej – Shmeat|publisher=Comedy Central|date=17 March 2009|access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, a biotech startup called BiteLabs ran a campaign to generate popular support for [[Artisanal food|artisanal]] [[salami]] made with meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bitelabs.org/|title=BiteLabs|website=bitelabs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign became popular on [[Twitter]], where users tweeted at celebrities asking them to donate muscle cells to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/03/celebrity-salami-bitelabs_n_4890762.html | work=The Huffington Post | title=Hunger Game?

In late 2016, cultured meat was involved in a case in the episode "How The Sausage Is Made" of [[CBS]] show ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Elementary - How the Sausage is Made - Review: "Fake Meat, Real Murder" |url=https://www.spoilertv.com/2016/12/elementary-how-sausage-is-made-review.html |access-date=2022-10-25 |website=www.spoilertv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultured meat was profiled in the 2020 Canadian documentary film ''[[Meat the Future]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Woodend, [https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2020/05/15/Ready-Meat-Future/ "Are We Ready to ‘Meat the Future’?"]. ''[[The Tyee]]'', May 15, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2020 video game ''[[Cyberpunk 2077]]'', multiple cultured meat products are for sale, due to the high cost of natural meat. This includes "EEZYBEEF", made from ''in vitro'' cultured muscle cells taken from [[cattle]], and the [[flatworm]] culture based "Orgiatic" which comes in several flavors.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

=== Metabolism of phenolics ===
''Cunninghamella elegans'' can be used to study the metabolism of phenols. This type of molecules already have reactive and polar groups comprised within their structure therefore phases I enzymes are less active than phase II (conjugation) enzymes.

==== Metabolism of flavonoids ====
; Flavonols
In flavonols, an hydroxyl group is available in the 3- position allowing the [[glycosylation]] at that position. The biotransformation of [[quercetin]] yields three metabolites, including [[quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside]], [[kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside]] and [[isorhamnetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside]]. Glucosylation and O-methylation are involved in the process.&lt;ref name=Zi/&gt; 
; Flavones
In flavones, there is no hydroxyl group available at the 3- position. Conjugation, in the form of [[sulfation]] occurs at the 7- or 4'- positions. [[Apigenin]] and [[chrysin]] are also transformed by ''C. elegans'' and produce [[apigenin 7-sulfate]], [[apigenin 7,4′-disulfate]], [[chrysin 7-sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ibrahim | first1 = A.

&lt;br/&gt;[[Sulfation]] also occurs on [[naringenin]] and produces [[naringenin-7-sulfate]].&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abdel-Rahim S.

Glucosylation may nevertheless occur but in 3'- position, as happens during the microbial transformation of [[psiadiarabin]] and its 6-desmethoxy analogue, [[5,3′ dihydroxy-7,2′,4′,5′-tetramethoxyflavone]], by ''Cunninghamella elegans'' NRRL 1392 that gives the 3′-glucoside conjugates of the two flavones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; flavanones
As in flavones, there is no hydroxyl groups available at the 3- position for glycosylation in flavanones. Therefore, sulfation occurs at the 7- position. In compounds like 7-methoxylated flavanones like 7-O-methylnaringenin ([[sakuranetin]]), [[demethylation]] followed by [[sulfation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Cure Rare Disease''' is a non-profit biotechnology company based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] that is working to create novel therapeutics using gene therapy, gene editing ([[CRISPR]] technology) and antisense oligonucleotides to treat people impacted by [[Rare disease|rare and ultra-rare genetic neuromuscular conditions]].

== History ==
Richard Horgan founded Terry's Foundation for Muscular Dystrophy in 2017, which became Cure Rare Disease in 2018, in order to develop a cure for [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] for his brother who has been battling the disease since childhood. Leveraging his network from [[Harvard Business School]], Horgan formed a collaboration consisting of leading researchers and clinicians around the country to develop this cure for his brother, and eventually founded Cure Rare Disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Inside the Nonprofit Aiming to Disrupt Big Pharma, One Case Study at a Time|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/inno/stories/profiles/2019/10/31/inside-the-nonprofit-aiming-to-disrupt-big-pharma.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220123003043/https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/inno/stories/profiles/2019/10/31/inside-the-nonprofit-aiming-to-disrupt-big-pharma.html |archive-date=2022-01-23 |access-date=2020-09-18|website=www.bizjournals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horgan connected first with a scientist at [[Boston Children's Hospital]], Dr. Timothy Yu, who had just successfully created a custom drug for a girl with the neurodegenerative condition, Batten disease using antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology. Horgan's brother's mutation is not amenable to ASO technology, so Horgan adopted the process and instead used CRISPR as the technology to attempt to cure his brother.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

This collaboration has expanded over the past three years and has led to the addition of notable researchers and institutions collaborating with Cure Rare Disease on their mission to treat rare disease.

== Research ==
There are currently three drugs approved by the FDA for Duchenne muscular dystrophy to treat the patients with mutations on the dystrophin gene encompassing exon 51, 53, and 45. However, people with DMD have mutations impacting different exons of the gene, so these do not work to treat all patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Commissioner |first=Office of the |date=2020-08-12 |title=FDA Approves Targeted Treatment for Rare Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Mutation |url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-targeted-treatment-rare-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-mutation |access-date=2022-07-22 |website=FDA |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Commissioner |first=Office of the |date=2020-03-24 |title=FDA grants accelerated approval to first drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy |url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-first-drug-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy |access-date=2022-07-22 |website=FDA |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Commissioner |first=Office of the |date=2021-02-25 |title=FDA Approves Targeted Treatment for Rare Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Mutation |url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-targeted-treatment-rare-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-mutation-0 |access-date=2022-07-22 |website=FDA |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cure Rare Disease is developing novel therapeutics using gene replacement, gene editing (CRISPR gene-editing) and antisense oligonucleotide technologies. To systemically deliver  a subset of therapeutics, including CRISPR, the therapeutic is inserted into the adeno-associated virus (AAV).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The drug developed for Horgan’s brother used a CRISPR transcriptional activator which functions to upregulate an alternative isoform of dystrophin. Because the CRISPR activation technology does not induce a double stranded cut, rather it acts to upregulate the target of interest, there is less risk of introducing an off-target genetic mutation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Custom CRISPR therapies could be closer than you think|url=https://cen.acs.org/business/Custom-CRISPR-therapies-closer-be-closer-than-you-think/97/web/2019/10|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the collaboration with Cure Rare Disease, researchers at [[Charles River Laboratories]], headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, have develop animal models with the same genetic mutation as the person to be treated with the drug so that therapeutic efficacy and safety can be shown.

After extensive efficacy and safety testing, Cure Rare Disease secured approval of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to dose Terry with the first-in-human CRISPR transcriptional activator in July 2022. 

Finding success in developing a novel framework to treat the first patient, Cure Rare Disease expanded the development of additional therapeutics. Currently, there are 18 mutations and conditions in the Cure Rare Disease pipeline, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, various subtypes of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), and ADSSL1 distal myopathy. As of 2022, none of these conditions have a viable treatment available for the population impacted. To better plan for future therapeutic endeavors, Cure Rare Disease established a patient registry where patients and patient families can input their mutation information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cure Rare Disease |url=https://www.cureraredisease.org/ |access-date=2022-07-22 |website=www.cureraredisease.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''custom-made medical device''', commonly referred to as a '''custom-made device''' ('''CMD''') ([[Canada]], [[European Union]], [[United Kingdom]]) or a '''custom device''' ([[United States]]), is a [[medical device]] designed and manufactured for the sole use of a particular patient. Examples of custom-made medical devices include [[auricular splint]]s, [[dentures]], [[Orthodontic technology|orthodontic appliances]], [[orthotics]] and [[Prosthesis|prostheses]].

==Definition==
There is no globally agreed definition, but a custom-made medical device can be broadly defined as a medical device that has been designed and manufactured in accordance with a prescription from an appropriately qualified person for the sole use of a particular patient to meet their specific needs. Mass-produced medical devices that have been adapted for specific patient requirements such as [[wheelchair|customised wheelchairs]], [[hearing aid]]s and [[Glasses|optical glasses/spectacle frames]] do not typically fall within the definition of a custom-made medical device.

==Legislative requirements==

=== Australia===
In Australia, manufacturers of custom-made medical devices are exempt from registering with the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Manufacturers of custom-made medical devices cannot advertise such devices directly to patients and are required to:
*Notify the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] that they are providing custom-made medical devices.
*Comply with the ARTG exemption conditions concerning inspection and review.
*Provide appropriate documentation with devices that they manufacture and/or supply.
*Maintain records relating to the devices that they have manufactured and/or supplied in Australia for at least five years.
*Submit an annual report with details of the custom-made medical devices that they have manufactured and/or supplied to the Therapeutic Goods Administration.&lt;ref name=AustraliaCMD/&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, custom-made medical devices are subject to Part 2 of the Medical Devices Regulations ([[Statutory Orders and Regulations|SOR]]/98-282) &lt;ref name=CanadaMDR/&gt; under the [[Food and Drugs Act]]. Serious adverse incidents with medical devices must be [[Medical device reporting|reported]] to [[Health Canada]] within 72 hours.

===European Union===
Custom-made devices manufactured in the [[European Union]] are subject to [[Regulation (EU) 2017/745|Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (Medical Device Regulation [EU MDR])]],&lt;ref name=EUMDR/&gt; which replaced and [[repeal]]ed [[Medical Devices Directive|Directive 93/42/EEC (Medical Devices Directive [MDD])]].&lt;ref name=MDD/&gt; Under the MDD, manufacturers of custom-made devices were required to follow the relevant Essential Requirements set out in Annex I and the procedure set out in Annex VIII.

The EU MDR was published on 5 April 2017, came into force on 25 May 2017 and, following a three-year transition period, was expected to replace and repeal the MDD on 26 May 2020. However, on 23 April 2020, Regulation (EU) 2020/561 was adopted which deferred the full implementation of the EU MDR for one year until 26 May 2021 so that efforts could be concentrated on the response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic]]. Under the EU MDR, manufacturers of custom-made devices are required to:

*Establish, document, implement and maintain, keep up to date and continually improve a [[quality management system]]. These requirements are provided in EU MDR Article 10(9) and are aligned with certain clauses of [[ISO 13485]], the [[International Organization for Standardization| International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]] quality management system requirements for the design and manufacture of medical devices.
*Comply with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements set out in Annex I. These obligations are comparable with the MDD Annex I Essential Requirements but are expanded and include the requirement to establish, implement, document and maintain a [[risk management|risk management system]], the requirements of which are in alignment with [[ISO 14971]], the ISO standard for the application of risk management to medical devices.
*The procedure set out in Annex XIII, which is comparable with MDD Annex VIII but with some enhanced requirements.
*Review and document experience gained in the post-production phase and report serious incidents and field safety corrective actions.
*Manufacturers outside the EU who are placing medical devices on the EU market are obligated to appoint a [[European Authorized Representative]].&lt;ref name=Green2021/&gt;

Custom-made devices are not required to carry the [[CE marking]].

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom (UK)]], manufacturers of custom-made devices are required to register with the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]]. Until the UK [[Brexit|left the European Union]] on 31 January 2020, custom-made devices were governed by the MDD, which was given effect in UK law by The Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (Statutory Instrument 2002/618 [UK MDR 2002]&lt;ref name=UKMDR2002/&gt;). Immediately after the UK's departure, the UK entered an 11-month [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|implementation period (IP)]], during which EU law continued to apply.

In preparation for the UK's departure from the EU, the EU MDR was essentially transposed into The Medical Devices (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, (Statutory Instrument 2019/791 [UK MDR 2019]), an amendment of the UK MDR 2002&lt;ref name=UKMDR2019/&gt;) and was expected to be fully implemented on exit day. The UK MDR 2002 was further amended by The Medical Devices (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (Statutory Instrument 2020/1478 [UK MDR 2020]&lt;ref name=UKMDR2020/&gt;), which removed the provisions of the EU MDR and substituted 'exit day' for 'IP completion day'.

In [[Great Britain]], medical devices can conform to either the UK MDR 2002 (as amended) or the EU MDR until 30 June 2023. [[Northern Ireland]] remains in line with EU law under the terms of the [[Northern Ireland Protocol|Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=POINI/&gt;

Custom-made devices are not required to carry the [[CE marking]] or the [[UKCA marking|UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) marking]].

===United States===
Custom Devices are subject to requirements including, but not limited to, labelling ([[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations|21 CFR]] Part 801), [[Medical device reporting|reporting]] (21 CFR Part 803), corrections and removals (21 CFR Part 806), registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807) and [[Quality management system|quality systems regulation]] (21 CFR 820). Manufacturers of custom devices are obligated to submit an annual report of custom devices to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] but are exempt from Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements and conformance to mandatory performance standards.&lt;ref name=USCD/&gt;

      <text bytes="16391" xml:space="preserve">The '''Cuvier–Geoffroy debate''' of 1830 was a scientific debate between the two French naturalists [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]].&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Valerie, "Essay: The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate". Embryo Project Encyclopedia (2013-10-07). http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/essay-cuvier-geoffroy-debate {{ISSN|1940-5030}} http://embryo.asu.edu/handle/10776/6276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For around two months the debate occurred in front of the French Academy of Sciences. The debate centered primarily on animal structure; Cuvier asserted that animal structure was determined by an organism's functional needs while Geoffroy suggested an alternative theory that all animal structures were modified forms of one unified plan. In terms of scientific significance, the discussion between the two naturalists showed stark differences in scientific methods as well as general philosophy. Cuvier is generally considered the winner of the debate, as he always came better prepared to the debate with overwhelming amounts of evidence and more logical arguments, as well as having more political and academic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite this, Geoffroy's philosophy is seen as early support of [[evolution]] theory and parts of the theory of the "unity of composition" are generally more accepted over Cuvier's fixed species philosophy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Early lives ==
Both naturalists had a love for classification and description but grew up with different influences. Geoffroy came to Paris to study medicine, law and philosophy in early 1789, but shifted to the study of zoology not long after. When a priest mentor of Geoffroy's became caught up in the political turmoil of the revolution of 1789, it was through Geoffroy's testimony that the priest was released from prison. Making friends in the church led to his eventual appointment as a zoology professor in the [[Jardin du Roi|Royal Garden]] (later became the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum of Natural History]]), when a post was vacated due to more political problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding Order in Nature|last=Farber|first=Paul Lawrence|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8018-6389-9|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=[https://archive.org/details/findingorderinna0000farb/page/37 37–45]|url=https://archive.org/details/findingorderinna0000farb/page/37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was only twenty-one years old at the time, this position gave Geoffroy access to resources and natural collections in which he built his future theories on nature. He was even able to accompany [[Napoleon]] on an expedition to Egypt in 1798 where he studied mummies and made hypotheses on change over time in humans and other organisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy agreed with Buffon that any classification system was arbitrary and thus somewhat empty, but he nonetheless attempted to find the general laws that applied to all organisms in nature.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before their well-known rivalry developed, the two scientists began as close colleagues and friends. Cuvier met a member of the Academy of Sciences, [[Henri-Alexandre Tessier]], in Normandy in 1794 while he was a young man tutoring the children of the wealthy. Tessier was impressed by Cuvier's talent and skill, and soon after wrote glowing letters to established scientists like Geoffroy and another, Jussier. Geoffroy was charmed by Cuvier's detailed descriptions of animals and his precise sketches and decided to invite him to "come to Paris. Come play among us the role of another legislator of natural history."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; When Cuvier joined him at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum]], other colleagues warned Geoffroy against mentoring him, suggesting that this brilliant young scientist would eventually surpass him.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Despite this premonition, both scientists worked side by side and wrote five papers together on the classification of mammals, the two-horned African rhinoceros, species of elephants, descriptions of the tarsier, and the biology of the orangutan. It was not long before Cuvier began to make a name for himself individually too, as he was highly skilled at reaching out to patrons, networking and acquiring funding for his research. By 1796 Cuvier was working on his papers on extinction, merely two years after joining the Museum, while Geoffroy had barely begun to publish. One of the most significant events that solidified the split between the two scientists was Cuvier's appointment to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] on December 17, 1795 as one of the six original members of anatomy and zoology. Cuvier was only twenty-six years old (three years Geoffroy's junior) and the youngest member at the time, while Geoffroy was not given admittance to the Academy for another twelve years.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Differing viewpoints ==
Prior to the debate, biological scientists were generally split into two major factions: whether animal structure was determined by functional needs of an animal or the "conditions of existence"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology|last=Russel|first=Edward Stewart|publisher=J. Murray|year=1916|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Cuvier), or a basic unified form that was modified across all animal forms (Geoffroy).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By determining the answer to this question, scientists could also shed light on the mechanisms of the evolution of species,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate: French Biology in the Decades before Darwin|last=Appel|first=Toby|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-19-504138-0|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as potentially finding a useful system to classify species to better understand the order of nature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cuvier was an influential scientist with significant political power and many prominent positions: permanent secretary at the French Academie of Science, a professorship at the Museum of Natural History and the College of France, as well as a Council member at the University of France. Cuvier stuck to "positive facts" of science and refused to flirt with hypotheses and unsupported ideas. This attitude sprang from worries that this kind of thinking would lead to unrest and disorder in France as the [[French Revolution]] had torn through only a few decades before.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Cuvier encouraged young scientists to stick with facts and often won them over easily due to his strong reputation as a good ally to have in science. His political ties and academic connections gave his ideas a broader audience and generally more historical recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy was heavily influenced by Buffon and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]. It was in his memoir ''[[Philosophie anatomique]]'', published in 1818, that he first put his ideas on animal form and structure into print.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead%2FMss.B.G287p-ead.xml%3Bquery%3D%3Bbrand%3Ddefault |title=Étienne Geoffroy Saint Hilaire Collection 1811-1844 |access-date=2019-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107145727/http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead%2FMss.B.G287p-ead.xml%3Bquery%3D%3Bbrand%3Ddefault |archive-date=2014-01-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Here he attempted to answer his own question, "Can the organization of vertebrated animals be referred to as one uniform type?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;!-- is this a literal quote?--&gt; Cuvier on the other hand was known as Lamarck's greatest critic, as Cuvier felt Lamarck was too speculative without enough facts to back up his theories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cuvier grew up reading the works of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and was mostly self-taught through dissection and measurements of organisms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy thought of facts as building blocks to science while new ideas would lead to real discovery, occasionally dipping more into philosophical hypotheses instead of testable or demonstrated research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy kept his unpopular ideas under wraps when advantageous to his career but found it increasingly difficult to stay passive as he got older and more well known.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;!--He may even have welcomed the debate between himself and Cuvier as a chance to liven up the discussions in the Academy and generate new ideas.--&gt;

== The debate (1830) ==
While the two biologists had disagreed on animal structure subtly through their publications, talks with other scientists at Academy meetings, and in private, a paper on mollusks written by two relatively unknown scientists drew Geoffroy and Cuvier at arms. The paper, written by Meyranx and Laurencet, was assigned to Geoffroy and [[Pierre André Latreille]] to review and report to the Academy. Meyranx and Laurencet's conclusions grabbed Geoffroy's attention by suggesting a link between vertebrate and mollusk internal anatomy. With thousands of drawings of mollusks and multiple essays, the authors argued that the organ arrangement of a mollusk resembled vertebrate organ arrangement, if the vertebrate bent backwards so that the neck was connected to the backside.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Geoffroy found support for his unity of composition which would unite the vertebrates and mollusks -two of Cuvier's published embranchments of animals&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;- on one common plan.

=== Geoffroy's initial report ===
On February 15, 1830, Geoffroy presented his report to the Academy. In an epilogue that was eventually removed from the final report at Cuvier's insistence, Geoffroy made a clear attack at Cuvier by quoting from a work of Cuvier's from 1817, "Memoir on the Cephalopods and on Their Anatomy", though the author and actual manuscript name were not mentioned. Geoffroy ridiculed the old-fashioned way of describing nature by focusing on differences instead of similarities, presenting his unity of composition theory as a better alternative. Cuvier disagreed vehemently with the report and paper's findings, promising to further explain his argument in future writings.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Cuvier's first response ===
At the next meeting of the Academy on February 22, Cuvier came fully prepared with detailed, labeled, colorful drawings, in particular one of an octopus and another of a duck bent backwards, and a new memoir called "Considerations on the Mollusks and in Particular on the Cephalopods".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He attacked Geoffroy's argument carefully and strategically. First, he argued for clear definitions in science and no ambiguity in language. Cuvier then proposed that composition was defined as the arrangement of parts. By this definition, to imagine that all organisms consisted of the same organs arranged in the same manner was illogical and false. Cuvier called Geoffroy's unity of composition more of a vague analogy for the composition of animals than true science. He emphasized how analogies did not belong in real science. Next Cuvier gave his own report on Meyranx and Laurencet's paper, showing example after example of how vertebrate and mollusk organ arrangement differed, whether by physical location or orientation in the body. By overwhelming the audience with his plethora of knowledge on cephalopod anatomy, he undercut Geoffroy's credibility and made a convincing argument of his own. After this point the debate became less about the mollusk data and more an argument between two differing scientific philosophies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Further discussion ===
On March 1, 1830, Geoffroy returned with his rebuttal, "On the Theory of Analogues, to Establish Its Novelty as a Doctrine, and Its Practical Utility as an Instrument". In response to Cuvier's comments about unity of composition being poorly defined, Geoffroy claimed that he was seeking more "philosophical resemblances" other than actual, observable similarities between animals. This vague explanation of unity of composition and the claim that others did not understand what unity of composition really meant did not satisfy Cuvier or his other critics. Geoffroy went on to defend his analogical theory, stressing the methodology of it all to align it to the scientific method. His theory looked at the connections between animals, and therefore was still applicable to making discoveries in science. To illustrate his points, Geoffroy used the example of the hyoid bone in vertebrates. He compared multiple animals with differing numbers of pieces making up the hyoid bone. In the cat with 9 hyoid pieces and humans with 5, Geoffroy made hypotheses for where the extra pieces had gone in humans,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; suggesting shifts to the ligaments and other bones of the jaw. Cuvier in response compared the hyoid bones across multiple species, where he saw different numbers of parts, different arrangements of the parts and in some, no hyoid at all. To Cuvier these differences suggested different functional needs and did not support unity of composition as Geoffroy said. To counter Cuvier's very analytical approach, Geoffroy said his rival was simply getting too bogged down in the details and forgetting the main issue of differences in philosophy. Cuvier continued to supply examples of differences amongst animal form, insisting Geoffroy explain why nature would be constrained to using the same parts similarly across all species.

=== End of the debate ===
By April 1830, the Academy was getting bored of the debate. At this point it had become far too personal and less about the ideas discussed but rather an continuous opportunity to bash each other publicly and academically. Geoffroy finally declined to provide further comment on April 5, 1830.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; His reasons for ending the debate are not entirely known, though it is generally believed that Cuvier won the debate with his commanding presence and overwhelming amounts of evidence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Results of the debate ==

After Geoffroy's initial inflammatory report, some other scientists in the Academy felt pressed to choose a side. In an effort to protect his reputation, the co-author on the report, Latreille, wrote to Cuvier to deny his participation in the report presented to the Academy, as well as to disassociate himself from Geoffroy's unity of composition theory.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Cuvier had just the year before helped Latreille, a rather old man of sixty-seven, replace Lamarck as a professor in the Museum. Both authors of the original cephalopod paper wrote to Cuvier as well to apologize for the trouble their paper had caused. However, the damage to Meyranx and Laurencet's careers may already have been done, as no future works by the authors have been recorded, nor is their cephalopod paper to be found.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

After the debate officially ended, both naturalists continued to throw in snide mentions to each other's works in Academy discussion, though neither Geoffroy nor Cuvier openly engaged each other again. The press and scientific journals followed their volatile disagreements up until Cuvier's death by cholera a mere two years after the debate. While the two naturalists were unable to reconcile their ideas in life, Geoffroy spoke at Cuvier's funeral quite fondly of his former friend, feeling pleased "to have been the first to recognize and reveal to the learned world the scope of genius who did not yet know it himself",&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; as well as saying anyone who studied the science of nature/natural history owed it to Cuvier for laying the foundation with his genius and massive knowledge of the natural world. While neither Geoffroy or Cuvier's ideas were fully adopted in future science theory, both unity of composition and functional morphology can be seen as influences to further works on the natural world. Geoffroy's ideas of unity of composition and development of more complex organisms from a common, less complex plan often recognize Geoffroy as one of the first to accept evolution theory.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''cyborg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|b|ɔːr|g}})—a [[portmanteau]] of [[cybernetics|'''''cyb'''ernetic'']] and [[organism|'''''org'''anism'']]—is a being with both [[Organic matter|organic]] and [[biomechatronic]] body parts. The term was coined in 1960 by [[Manfred Clynes]] and [[Nathan S. Kline]].&lt;ref name="andspace"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf Cyborgs and Space], in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E.

"Cyborg" is not the same thing as [[bionics]], [[biorobotics]], or [[android (robot)|androids]]; it applies to an organism that has restored function or, especially, [[Human enhancement|enhanced abilities]] due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of [[feedback]], for example [[Prosthesis|prostheses]], [[artificial organ]]s, [[Implant (medicine)|implants]] or, in some cases, [[wearable technology]].&lt;ref name="10.1080/14606925.2019.1594986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramoğlu |first1=Muhammet |title=Cyborg-Computer Interaction: Designing New Senses |journal=The Design Journal |date=1 April 2019 |volume=22 |issue=sup1 |pages=1215–1225 |doi=10.1080/14606925.2019.1594986 |issn=1460-6925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg technologies may enable or support [[collective intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ivana |first1=Greguric |title=Philosophical Issues of Human Cyborgization and the Necessity of Prolegomena on Cyborg Ethics |date=22 October 2021 |publisher=IGI Global |isbn=978-1-7998-9233-5 |url=https://www.google.ch/books/edition/Philosophical_Issues_of_Human_Cyborgizat/PqlQEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA97 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related, possibly broader, term is the "[[Human enhancement|augmented human]]".&lt;ref name="10.1080/14606925.2019.1594986"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Augmented humans will feature apps for the brain and embeddable devices |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-16/augmented-humans-are-just-around-the-corner/7515878 |access-date=14 November 2022 |work=ABC News |date=16 June 2016 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jahankhani |first1=Hamid |last2=Kendzierskyj |first2=Stefan |last3=Chelvachandran |first3=Nishan |last4=Ibarra |first4=Jaime |title=Cyber Defence in the Age of AI, Smart Societies and Augmented Humanity |date=6 April 2020 |publisher=Springer Nature |isbn=978-3-030-35746-7 |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=YKjbDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |access-date=14 November 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cyborgs are commonly thought of as [[mammal]]s, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of [[organism]].

===Placement and distinctions===
D. S. Halacy's ''Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman'' (1965) featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' – a bridge...between mind and matter."&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Halacy. 1965. ''Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman''. New York: Harper and Row Publishers. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Donna Haraway]], for as long as machines and technology have existed, a love-hate relationship has also existed between them and humanity. Haraway is at the forefront of this and dissects the interconnectedness of humans and technology.

She has written the [[A Cyborg Manifesto|Cyborg Manifesto]], which is a break-down of her views of cyborgs and the route that humanity is toward that concept. Haraway is a self-claimed cyborg, a product of science and technology, nothing special or different. In the modern-day and age, humanity has become so woven in with technology that it is hard to tell where the line that divides them is. This is especially apparent in medicine with the modifications we are now able to accomplish with modern science and technology.

As humans advance as a society, Haraway explains how all boundaries between humans, animals, and technology have been breached. This breach leads to hybrids and more complexities. Every place that meets the eye there is some form of technology that humans need and depend on. Science and technology have evolved so far that we rely on them for every little task in our life. There is somewhat of a cyborg age upon us. Just how Haraway’s world is filled with these tangled networks of humans and machines, our bodies are networks in themselves. It is not as natural as made out to be, it is fed food, kept alive on pharmaceuticals, and altered through medical procedures. Haraway believes that in order to survive we need to get behind the complex nature of technoculture.

This article can also be viewed from a feminist lens. Throughout history, women have always been told that they are “naturally” weak, submissive, and overemotional. But, if we are cyborgs as Haraway says, then all of us can be reconstructed and improved. There exists the ability to construct your identity, sexuality, and all just as you please to do so.

Since we have allowed and created machines and technology to be so advanced, there should be no reason to fear what we have created. Cyborgs should be embraced because they are now part of human identities. This being said, it is important to empathize with both sides because only having one perspective can cause more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Haraway|Haraway, D.]] 2006 (1984).

Weis et al., eds.Dordrecht: Springer, pp. 117-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosocial definition===
According to some definitions of the term, the physical attachments that [[human]]s have with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html ''A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by [[Donna Haraway]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical example, a human with an [[artificial pacemaker|artificial cardiac pacemaker]] or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], would be considered a cyborg, since these devices measure [[Electric potential|voltage potentials]] in the body, perform [[signal processing]], and can deliver [[Electrical stimulation|electrical stimuli]], using this synthetic [[feedback]] mechanism to keep that person alive. Implants, especially [[cochlear implant]]s, that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cyborg enhancements. Some theorists{{who|date=October 2014}} cite such modifications as [[contact lens]]es, [[hearing aid]]s, [[smartphone]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chong |first1=Benjamin Wittes and Jane |title=Our Cyborg Future: Law and Policy Implications |url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/our-cyborg-future-law-and-policy-implications/ |website=Brookings |access-date=10 November 2022 |date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[intraocular lens]]es as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities.

As cyborgs currently are on the rise, some theorists{{who|date=October 2014}} argue there is a need to develop new definitions of [[Ageing|aging]]. (For instance, a bio-techno-social definition of ''aging'' has been suggested.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wejbrandt | first1 = A | year = 2014 | title = Defining aging in cyborgs: A bio-techno-social definition of aging | journal = Journal of Aging Studies | volume = 31 | pages = 104–109 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaging.2014.09.003 | pmid = 25456627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used to address human-[[technology]] mixtures in the abstract. This includes not only commonly-used pieces of technology such as [[phones]], [[computer]]s, the [[Internet]], and so on, but also artifacts that may not popularly be considered technology; for example, [[pen]] and [[paper]], and [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[language]]. When augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places, a person becomes capable of much more than they were before. An example is a computer, which gains power by using [[Internet protocols]] to connect with other computers. Another example is a [[Social media#Bots|social-media bot]]—either a bot-assisted human or a human-assisted-bot—used to target [[social media]] with [[Like button|likes]] and [[Online sharing|shares]].&lt;ref name="cgwj"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1109/TDSC.2012.75|title = Detecting Automation of Twitter Accounts: Are You a Human, Bot, or Cyborg?|journal = IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing|volume = 9|issue = 6|pages = 811–824|year = 2012|last1 = Chu|first1 = Zi|last2 = Gianvecchio|first2 = Steven|last3 = Wang|first3 = Haining|last4 = Jajodia|first4 = Sushil|s2cid = 351844}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cybernetics|Cybernetic]] technologies include [[highway]]s, [[Plumbing|pipes]], [[electrical wiring]], [[building]]s, [[Power station|electrical plants]], [[libraries]], and other infrastructure that people hardly notice, but which are critical parts of the cybernetics that humans work within.

[[Bruce Sterling]], in his [[Shaper/Mechanist universe]], suggested an idea of an alternative cyborg called 'Lobster', which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (e.g. a [[powered exoskeleton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Bruce. 1985. ''[[Schismatrix]]''. Arbor House.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike human cyborgs, who appear human externally but are synthetic internally (e.g., the [[Bishop (Alien)|Bishop]] type in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'']] franchise),&lt;!-- This is more of a definition of an android. --&gt; Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally (such as in [[Elysium (film)|''Elysium'']] and ''[[RoboCop]]''). The computer game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' prominently features cyborgs called Omar, Russian for 'lobster'.

==Visual appearance of fictional cyborgs==

[[File:Serengeti Cyborg, by Fanuel Leul.jpg|thumb|right|An archetypal science-fiction cyborg with an [[Afrofuturist]] aesthetic]]
In [[science fiction]], the most stereotypical portrayal of a cyborg is a person (or, more rarely, an animal) with visible added mechanical parts. These include the superhero [[Cyborg (DC Comics)|Cyborg]] from [[DC Comics]] and the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] race from the ''[[Star Trek Universe|Star Trek]]'' [[Star Trek Universe|Universe]].

However, cyborgs can also be portrayed as looking more robotic or more organic. They may appear as [[humanoid robot]]s, such as [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]] from DC's ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' or most varieties of the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]''; they can appear as non-humanoid robots such as the [[Dalek]]s (again, from ''Doctor Who'') or like the majority of the motorball players in ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'' and its prequel ''[[Ashen Victor]]''.

More human-appearing cyborgs may cover up their mechanical parts with armor or clothing, such as [[Darth Vader]] (''[[Star Wars]]'') or [[Misty Knight]] ([[Marvel Comics]]). Cyborgs may have mechanical parts or bodies that appear human. For example, the eponymous [[The Six Million Dollar Man|Six Million Dollar Man]] and the [[The Bionic Woman|Bionic Woman]] (from their respective television series) have [[Prosthesis|prostheses]] externally identical to the body parts that they replaced; while [[Motoko Kusanagi|Major Motoko Kusanagi]] (''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'') is a full-body cyborg whose body appears human. In these examples, among others, it is common for cyborgs to have [[superhuman]] (physical or mental) abilities, including [[Superhuman strength|great strength]], [[Sensory substitution#Sensory augmentation|enhanced senses]], computer-assisted brains, or built-in weaponry.

== Origins ==
The concept of a man-machine mixture was widespread in [[science fiction]] before [[World War II]]. As early as 1843, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] described a man with extensive prostheses in the [[short story]] "[[The Man That Was Used Up]]". In 1911, [[Jean de La Hire]] introduced the [[Nyctalope]], a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first [[literary]] cyborg, in ''Le Mystère des XV'' (later translated as ''The Nyctalope on Mars'').&lt;ref name=Zehr&gt;{{cite book |last= Zehr |first= E.

He later featured the talking, living brain of an old scientist, Simon Wright, floating around in a transparent case, in all the adventures of his famous hero, [[Captain Future]]. In 1944, in the short story "[[No Woman Born]]", [[C. L. Moore]] wrote of Deirdre, a [[dance]]r, whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body.

In 1960, the term "cyborg" was coined by [[Manfred Clynes|Manfred E. Clynes]] and [[Nathan S. Kline]] to refer to their conception of an [[Enhanced human|enhanced human being]] who could survive in [[extrasolar planet|extraterrestrial]] environments:&lt;ref name="andspace"/&gt;

{{Cquote|For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] system unconsciously, we propose the term 'Cyborg'.
}}

Their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of space exploration was beginning to open up. A designer of [[physiology|physiological]] instrumentation and electronic data-processing systems, Clynes was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at [[Rockland State Hospital]] in New York.

The term first appears in print 5 months earlier when ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the "Psychophysiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium" where Clynes and Kline first presented their paper:

{{Cquote|A cyborg is essentially a man-machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/bbcwordhunt/cyborg.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824072139/http://www.oed.com/bbcwordhunt/cyborg.html|title=Entry from OED Online|archive-date=24 August 2010|work=oed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thereafter, Hamilton would first use the term "cyborg" explicitly in the 1962 short story, "After a Judgment Day", to describe the "mechanical analogs" called "Charlies," explaining that "[c]yborgs, they had been called from the first one in the 1960s...cybernetic organisms."

In 2001, a book titled ''Cyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the [[Wearable computer|Wearable Computer]]'' was published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyborg:Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable Computer|url=http://eyetap.org/cyborg.htm|publisher=By [[EyeTap (website)|EyeTap]]|access-date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the [[documentary film]] ''[[Cyberman (film)|Cyberman]]'' that same year.

== Cyborg tissues in engineering ==
Cyborg tissues structured with [[carbon nanotube]]s and [[Plant cell|plant]] or [[Fungal cell|fungal]] cells have been used in artificial [[tissue engineering]] to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses.

Such work was presented by [[Raffaele Di Giacomo]], [[Bruno Maresca]], and others, at the [[Materials Research Society]]'s spring conference on 3 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.mrs.org/Spring-2013/program-session/?code=SS Symposium SS: Bioelectronics—Materials, Interfaces, and Applications]." Materials Research Society. Talk number SS4.04: "Cyborgs Structured with Carbon Nanotubes and Plant and/or Fungal Cells: Artificial Tissue Engineering for Mechanical and Electronic Uses."&lt;/ref&gt; The cyborg obtained was inexpensive, light and had unique mechanical properties. It could also be shaped in the desired forms. [[Cell (biology)|Cells]] combined with [[MWCNT|multi-walled carbon nanotubes]] (MWCNTs) [[Coprecipitated|co-precipitated]] as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material. Likewise, dried cells still acted as a [[stable matrix]] for the MWCNT network. When observed by [[Optical microscope|optical microscopy]], the material resembled an artificial "[[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]" composed of highly packed cells. The effect of cell drying was manifested by their "[[ghost cell]]" appearance. A rather specific physical interaction between MWCNTs and cells was observed by [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]], suggesting that the [[cell wall]] (the outermost part of fungal and plant cells) may play a major active role in establishing a [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotube's]] network and its stabilization. This novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications, from heating to sensing. For instance, using ''[[Candida albicans]]'' cells, a species of [[yeast]] that often lives inside the human [[gastrointestinal tract]], cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TNANO.2013.2239308|title=Candida albicans/MWCNTS: A Stable Conductive Bio-Nanocomposite and Its Temperature-Sensing Properties|journal=IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=111–114|year=2013|last1=Di Giacomo|first1=Raffaele|last2=Maresca|first2=Bruno|last3=Porta|first3=Amalia|last4=Sabatino|first4=Paolo|last5=Carapella|first5=Giovanni|last6=Neitzert|first6=Heinz-Christoph|bibcode=2013ITNan..12..111D|s2cid=26949825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actual cyborgization attempts ==
[[File:Neil Harbisson cyborgist.jpg|thumb|Cyborg [[Neil Harbisson]] with his antenna implant|300x300px]]

In current [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] applications, the [[C-Leg]] system developed by [[Otto Bock HealthCare]] is used to replace a [[human leg]] that has been [[amputated]] because of injury or illness. The use of sensors in the artificial C-Leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user's natural [[gait]], as it would be prior to amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottobockus.com/PRODUCTS/LOWER_LIMB_PROSTHETICS/cleg_technology.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330002400/http://www.ottobockus.com/PRODUCTS/LOWER_LIMB_PROSTHETICS/cleg_technology.asp|title=Otto Bock HealthCare : a global leader in healthcare products – Otto Bock|archive-date=30 March 2008|work=ottobockus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostheses like the C-Leg and the more advanced [[iLimb]] are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real-world cyborg applications.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Additionally [[cochlear implants]] and [[magnetic implants]] which provide people with a sense that they would not otherwise have had can additionally be thought of as creating cyborgs.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In [[vision science]], direct [[brain implant]]s have been used to treat non-[[congenital]] (acquired) [[blindness]]. One of the first scientists to come up with a working [[brain interface]] to restore sight was a private researcher [[William H. Dobelle|William Dobelle]].
Dobelle's first prototype was implanted into "Jerry", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 [[electrode]]s was implanted onto Jerry's [[visual cortex]] and succeeded in producing [[phosphenes]], the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a two-ton [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/vision.html Vision quest], ''Wired Magazine'', September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Philip Kennedy, a scientist and physician, created the world's first human cyborg from [[Johnny Ray (veteran cyborg)|Johnny Ray]], a [[Vietnam veteran]] who suffered a [[stroke]]. Ray's body, as doctors called it, was "[[locked-in syndrome|locked in]]". Ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to Kennedy's experiment. Kennedy embedded an implant he designed (and named a "[[neurotrophic electrode]]") near the injured part of Ray's brain so that Ray would be able to have some movement back in his body. The surgery went successfully, but in 2002, Ray died.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Sherry. "Rise of the Cyborgs." Discover 29.10 (2008): 50. Science Reference Center. Web. 4 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Canadian [[Jens Naumann]], also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle's second-generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second-generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry-night effect. Immediately after his implant, Naumann was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, James [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/bmi-the-research-that-holds-the-key-to-hope-for-millions-835850.html BMI: the research that holds the key to hope for millions], [[The Independent]] 29 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to replacement technologies, in 2002, under the heading [[Project Cyborg]], a British scientist, [[Kevin Warwick]], had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his [[nervous system]] in order to link his nervous system into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities. With this in place, Warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a [[robotic hand]], also receiving feedback from the fingertips in order to control the hand's grip. This was a form of extended sensory input. Subsequently, he investigated [[ultrasonic]] input in order to [[Sonar|remotely detect the distance to objects]]. Finally, with electrodes also implanted into his wife's nervous system, they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: "Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy", [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185–189, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369| pmid = 14568806| title = The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems| journal = Archives of Neurology| volume = 60| issue = 10| pages = 1369–73| year = 2003| last1 = Warwick | first1 = K. | last2 = Gasson | first2 = M. | last3 = Hutt | first3 = B. | last4 = Goodhew | first4 = I. | last5 = Kyberd | first5 = P. | last6 = Andrews | first6 = B. | last7 = Teddy | first7 = P. | last8 = Shad | first8 = A. | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later, in 2005, he decided to have his ever-deteriorating and now technically blind eye surgically removed,&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{Cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/2008/12/eye-spy-filmmak/ | title=Eye Spy: Filmmaker Plans to Install Camera in His Eye Socket| magazine=Wired| date=2008-12-04| last1=Ganapati| first1=Priya}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereafter he wore an [[eyepatch]] for some time before he later, after having played for some time with the idea of installing a camera instead, contacted professor [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], an expert in wearable computing and cyborg technology.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt;

Under Mann's guidance, Spence, at age 36, created a prototype in the form of the miniature camera which could be fitted inside his [[Ocular prosthesis|prosthetic eye]]; an invention that would come to be named by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] as one of the best inventions of 2009. The bionic eye records everything he sees and contains a 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Low resolution|low-resolution]] video camera, a small round [[printed circuit board]], a wireless video transmitter, which allows him to transmit what he is seeing in real-time to a computer, and a 3-[[volt]] [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[VARTA]] [[Micro battery|microbattery]]. The eye is not connected to his brain and has not restored his sense of vision. Additionally, Spence has also installed a [[laser]]-like [[LED]] light in one version of the prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/biomedical/bionics/061110-eyeborg-bionic-eye | title=Eyeborg: Man Replaces False Eye with Bionic Camera| year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In medicine and biotechnology ===
{{section too long|date=November 2022}}
{{See also|Telemedicine}}
In [[medicine]], there are two important and different types of cyborgs: the restorative and the enhanced. Restorative technologies "restore lost function, organs, and limbs."&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Chris Hables, ed. ''The Cyborg Handbook''. New York: Routledge, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function. There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost.

On the contrary, the enhanced cyborg "follows a principle, and it is the principle of optimal performance: maximising output (the information or modifications obtained) and minimising input (the energy expended in the process)".&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean François: ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge''. Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present.

Although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice, bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely. [[Michael Chorost]] wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlear implants, or bionic ears, titled ''Rebuilt: How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chorost | first1 = Michael | year = 2008 | title = The Naked Ear | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/review/409244/the-naked-ear/ | journal = Technology Review | volume = 111 | issue = 1| pages = 72–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesse Sullivan]] became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a [[nerve]]-[[muscle]] graft, enabling him a complex [[range of motion]]s beyond that of previous prosthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = Chuck | year = 2005 | title = Re-wiring the Body | journal = Design News | volume = 60 | issue = 15| pages = 67–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, a fully functioning [[artificial heart]] was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haddad | first1 = Michel | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Improved Early Survival with the Total Artificial Heart | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 161–165 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2004.47335.x | pmid = 14961955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The continued technological development of bionic and ([[bionanotechnology|bio-]])[[nanotechnologies]] begins to raise the question of enhancement, and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model. The ethics and desirability of "enhancement prosthetics" have been debated; their proponents include the [[Transhumanism|transhumanist movement]], with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present, normative limitations such as [[Life extension|aging]] and disease, as well as other, more general inabilities, such as limitations on speed, [[Superhuman strength|strength]], endurance, and [[Intelligence#Improving|intelligence]]. Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies; namely, a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de-emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and [[personhood]], in favor of definition in terms of upgrades, versions, and utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marsen | first1 = Sky | year = 2008 | title = Becoming More Than Human: Technology and the Post-Human Condition Introduction | url = http://jetpress.org/v19/marsen.htm | journal = Journal of Evolution &amp; Technology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Horgan |first1=John |title=Who Wants to Be a Cyborg? |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/who-wants-to-be-a-cyborg/ |website=Scientific American |access-date=14 November 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[brain-computer interface]], or BCI, provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device, effectively creating a cyborg. Research into invasive BCIs, which utilize electrodes implanted directly into the [[grey matter]] of the brain, has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to [[Paralysis|paralyzed]] people, most notably those with severe cases, such as [[locked-in syndrome]]. This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a [[wheelchair]] the power to control the devices that aid them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices. It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Sherry. "RISE OF THE CYBORGS." ''Discover'' 2008; 29(10): 50–57. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep brain stimulation]] is a [[Neurosurgery|neurological surgical procedure]] used for therapeutic purposes. This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[epilepsy]], [[chronic headaches]], and [[mental disorder]]s. After the patient is [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], through [[anesthesia]], [[brain pacemaker]]s or electrodes, are implanted into the [[Brain regions|region of the brain]] where the cause of the disease is present. The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of [[electric current]] to disrupt the oncoming surge of [[seizure]]s. Like all [[Minimally-invasive procedures|invasive procedures]], deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk. However, there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available [[Neuropharmacology|drug treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Alzheimer's: Deep brain stimulation 'reverses' disease|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15890749 |work=BBC News|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Retinal implant]]s are another form of cyborgization in medicine. The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision to people suffering from [[retinitis pigmentosa]] and vision loss due to aging (conditions in which people have an abnormally low number of [[retinal ganglion cell]]s) is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells (cells which connect the eye to the brain).

While work to perfect this technology is still being done, there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light. A specialized camera is worn by the subject, such as on the frames of their glasses, which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation. A chip located in the user's eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user. If technological advances proceed as planned, this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them.

A similar process has been created to aid people who have lost their [[vocal cords]]. This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic-sounding [[Speech synthesis|voice simulators]]. The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck, where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its [[electrical signal]]s. The signals would then move to a [[Signal processor|processor]] which would control the timing and [[Pitch (sound)|pitch]] of a voice simulator. That simulator would then vibrate producing a multi-tonal sound that could be shaped into words by the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Bonnie. "Was blind, but now I see." 11. Christian Century Foundation, 2007. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''[[Nature Materials]]'' in 2012 reported research on "cyborg tissues" (engineered human tissues with embedded three-dimensional mesh of nanoscale wires), with possible medical implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/merging-the-biological-electronic/|title=Merging the biological, electronic|work=Harvard Gazette|date=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, researchers from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] had developed a device that could keep a [[Cardiac cycle|heart beating]] endlessly. By using [[3D printing]] and [[computer modeling]], these scientists developed an electronic [[membrane]] that could successfully replace pacemakers. The device utilizes a "spider-web like network of sensors and electrodes" to monitor and maintain a normal [[heart rate]] with electrical stimuli. Unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient, the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high-resolution imaging technology. The first prototype was created to fit a [[Rabbit|rabbit's]] heart, operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient-rich solution. The stretchable material and [[Electrical circuit|circuits]] of the apparatus were first constructed by Professor [[John A. Rogers]] in which the electrodes are arranged in an s-shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking. Although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate, in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard against [[heart attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/3dprinted-electronic-glove-could-help-keep-your-heart-beating-for-ever-9166004.html|title=3D-printed 'electronic glove' could help keep your heart beating for ever|work=The Independent|date=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Automated insulin delivery systems]], colloquially also known as the "artificial pancreas", are a substitute for the lack of natural [[insulin]] production by the body, most notably in [[Type 1 Diabetes|Type 1 diabetes]]. Currently available systems combine a [[continuous glucose monitor]] with an [[insulin pump]] that can be remote controlled, forming a control loop that automatically adjusts the [[Insulin (medication)|insulin]] dosage depending on the current [[blood glucose level]]. Examples of commercial systems that implement such a control loop are the [[Insulin pump#Developments|MiniMed 670G]] from [[Medtronic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/minimed-670g-insulin-pump-system|title=MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump System|date=2020-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the t:slim x2 from [[Tandem Diabetes Care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/products/t-slim-x2-insulin-pump|title=t:slim X2 Insulin Pump w/ Dexcom G6 CGM - Get Started!|date=2020-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Do-it-yourself artificial pancreas technologies also exist, though these are not verified or approved by any regulatory agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/diabetes-technology/diy-looping|title=DIY closed loop system (artificial pancreas)|date=2020-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upcoming next-generation artificial pancreas technologies include automatic [[Glucagon (medication)|glucagon]] infusion in addition to insulin, to help prevent [[hypoglycemia]] and improve efficiency. One example of such a bi-hormonal system is the [[Beta Bionics]] [[iLet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.betabionics.com/|title=Beta Bionics - Introducing the iLet|date=2020-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military organizations' research has recently focused on the utilization of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage. [[DARPA]] has announced its interest in developing "cyborg insects" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the [[pupa]] stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a [[Microelectromechanical systems|microelectromechanical system]] (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060313-120147-9229r.htm The military seeks to develop 'insect cyborgs']. ''Washington Times'' (13 March 2006). Retrieved 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, DARPA is developing a [[neural]] implant to remotely control the movement of [[sharks]].  The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/060307_shark_implant.html Military Plans Cyborg Sharks].

The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which was remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes.

In 2016, [[Cybathlon]] became the first cyborg 'Olympics'; celebrated in Zurich, Switzerland, it was the first worldwide and official celebration of cyborg sports. In this event, 16 teams of people with disabilities used technological developments to turn themselves into cyborg athletes. There were 6 different events and its competitors used and controlled advanced technologies such as powered [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] legs and arms, [[robotic exoskeleton]]s, bikes, and [[motorized wheelchair]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cybathlon|url=http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was already a remarkable improvement, as it allowed disabled people to compete and showed the several technological enhancements that are already making a difference; however, it showed that there is still a long way to go. For instance, the exoskeleton race still required its participants to stand up from a chair and sit down, navigate a [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] and other simple activities such as walking over stepping stones and climbing up and down stairs. Despite the simplicity of these activities, 8 of the 16 teams that participated in the event drop off before the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strickland|first=Eliza|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/bionics/at-the-worlds-first-cyborg-olympics-manmachine-hybrids-raced-for-the-gold|title=At the World's First Cybathlon, Proud Cyborg Athletes Raced for the Gold|work=IEEE Spectrum|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, one of the main goals of this event and such simple activities is to show how technological enhancements and advanced prosthetics can make a difference in people's lives. The next Cybathlon that was expected to occur in 2020, was cancelled due to the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports|coronavirus pandemic]].

The concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction. However, many artists have tried to create public awareness of cybernetic organisms; these can range from paintings to installations. Some artists who create such works are [[Neil Harbisson]], [[Moon Ribas]], [[Patricia Piccinini]], [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]], [[Orlan]], [[H. R. Giger]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Wafaa Bilal]], [[Tim Hawkinson]], and [[Stelarc]].

Stelarc is a [[performance artist]] who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body. He uses medical instruments, prosthetics, robotics, virtual reality systems, the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate, intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body. He has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm. Between 1976 and 1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin. For 'Third Ear', he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet-enabled, making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/stelarc/a29-extended_body.html Extended-Body: Interview with Stelarc].

==== Artists as cyborgs ====
Artists have explored the term ''cyborg'' from a perspective involving imagination. Some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human-bodily union apparent to reality in an art form utilizing varying mediums, from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings.
Artists who seek to make cyborg-based fantasies a reality often call themselves '''cyborg artists''', or may consider their artwork "cyborg". How an artist or their work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter's flexibility with the term.

Scholars that rely upon a strict, technical description of a cyborg, often going by [[Norbert Wiener]]'s cybernetic theory and [[Manfred Clynes|Manfred E. Clynes]] and [[Nathan S. Kline]]'s first use of the term, would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs.&lt;ref name="Tenney"&gt;Tenney, Tom; "[http://inc.ongruo.us/2010/12/29/cybernetics-in-art-and-the-myth-of-the-cyborg-artist/ Cybernetics in Art and the Myth of the Cyborg Artist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720034620/http://inc.ongruo.us/2010/12/29/cybernetics-in-art-and-the-myth-of-the-cyborg-artist/ |date=20 July 2012 }}"; inc.ongruo.us; 29 December 2010; 9 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more than cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;Volkart, Yvonne; "[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/cyborg_bodies/editorial/1/ Cyborg Bodies. The End of the Progressive Body: Editorial]"; medienkunstnetz.de; 9 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Others may speak of defining subcategories, or specialized cyborg types, that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual. This may range from technological instruments being external, temporary, and removable to being fully integrated and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyborganthropology.com/What_is_a_Cyborg?|title=What is a Cyborg - Cyborg Anthropology|website=cyborganthropology.com|access-date=2019-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, cyborg artists are artists. Being so, it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather than a strict, technical representation of the term,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Kate; "Cyborg The artist as cyborg"; theglobeandmail.com; 18 February 2011; Web; 5 March 2012. | https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-artist-as-cyborg/article1913032/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105051147/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-artist-as-cyborg/article1913032/ |date=5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborgism.&lt;ref name="Tenney" /&gt;

=== In body modification ===
As medical technology becomes more advanced, some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community. While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics,&lt;ref name="TechReviewMod"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/23847/page1/ |title=Implantable Silicon-Silk Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[augmented reality]]&lt;ref name="HeartChaos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartchaos.com/post/5134010603/nintendo-3ds-augmented-reality-tattoo-is-awesome-real|title=I Heart Chaos – Nintendo 3DS augmented reality tattoo is awesome,...|work=iheartchaos.com|access-date=23 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426074651/http://www.iheartchaos.com/post/5134010603/nintendo-3ds-augmented-reality-tattoo-is-awesome-real|archive-date=26 April 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and QR codes&lt;ref name="QRTatt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forevergeek.com/2011/07/qr-code-tattoo/|title=QR Code Tattoo for the Geek|author=Noemi Tasarra-Twigg|work=ForeverGeek|date=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body. Hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfaces&lt;ref name="WiredTatt"&gt;{{cite magazine| url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/11/the-illustrated-man-how-led-tattoos-could-change-the-face-of-humanity/ | magazine=Wired | first=Charlie | last=Sorrel | title=The Illustrated Man: How LED Tattoos Could Make Your Skin a Screen | date=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Core77Gadgets"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120301124121/http://www.core77.com/competitions/GreenerGadgets/projects/4673 Digital Tattoo Interface], Jim Mielke, United States&lt;/ref&gt; would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality, bringing a [[transhumanist]] way of life into present day reality.

In addition, it is quite plausible for anxiety expression to manifest. Individuals may experience pre-implantation feelings of fear and nervousness. To this end, individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness, particularly in a socialized setting, due to their post-operative, technologically augmented bodies, and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion. Anxieties may be linked to notions of otherness or a cyborged identity.&lt;ref name="Springer-509728"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aging: I don't want to be a cyborg! |date=1 September 2008 |issn=1568-7759 |doi=10.1007/s11097-008-9096-0 |issue=3 |volume=7 |pages=397–404 |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |first=Don |last=Ihde|s2cid=144175101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In space ===
Sending humans to space is a dangerous task in which the implementation of various cyborg technologies could be used in the future for risk mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyborg Astronauts Needed to Colonize Space|url=http://www.space.com/9128-cyborg-astronauts-needed-colonize-space.html|work=Space.com|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hawking, a renowned physicist, stated "Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming, nuclear war... I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space." The difficulties associated with space travel could mean it might be centuries before humans ever become a multi-planet species.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} There are many [[effect of spaceflight on the human body|effects of spaceflight on the human body]]. One major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen. If this necessity was taken out of the equation, space exploration would be revolutionized. A theory proposed by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline is aimed at tackling this problem. The two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is "capable of reducing CO2 to its components with the removal of the carbon and re-circulation of the oxygen..."&lt;ref name="cyborgspace"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/022697surf-cyborg.html Cyborgs and Space], The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; could make breathing unnecessary. Another prominent issue is [[radiation]] exposure. Yearly, the average human on earth is exposed to approximately 0.30 rem of radiation, while an astronaut aboard the International Space Station for 90 days is exposed to 9 rem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2017-04-16|title=Health|url=http://www.solarstorms.org/Sastronauts.html|work=solarstorms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the issue, Clynes and Kline theorized a cyborg containing a sensor that would detect radiation levels and a Rose osmotic pump "which would automatically inject protective pharmaceuticals in appropriate doses." Experiments injecting these protective pharmaceuticals into monkeys have shown positive results in increasing radiation resistance.&lt;ref name=cyborgspace /&gt;

Although the effects of spaceflight on our bodies are an important issue, the advancement of propulsion technology is just as important. With our current technology, it would take us about 260 days to get to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How long would a trip to Mars take?|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/venus/q2811.html|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study backed by NASA proposes an interesting way to tackle this issue through [[deep sleep]], or [[torpor]]. With this technique, it would "reduce astronauts' metabolic functions with existing medical procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2017-05-10|title=NASA Eyes Crew Deep Sleep Option for Mars Mission|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/nasa-eyes-crew-deep-sleep-option-for-mission-to-mars-141003.htm|work=DNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far experiments have only resulted in patients being in torpor state for one week. Advancements to allow for longer states of deep sleep would lower the cost of the trip to Mars as a result of reduced astronaut resource consumption.

=== In cognitive science ===
{{See also|Neuroenhancement}}
Theorists such as [[Andy Clark]] suggest that interactions between humans and technology result in the creation of a cyborg system. In this model, ''cyborg'' is defined as a part-biological, part-mechanical system that results in the augmentation of the biological component and the creation of a more complex whole. Clark argues that this broadened definition is necessary to an understanding of human cognition. He suggests that any tool which is used to offload part of a cognitive process may be considered the mechanical component of a cyborg system. Examples of this human and technology cyborg system can be very low tech and simplistic, such as using a calculator to perform basic mathematical operations or pen and paper to make notes, or as high tech as using a personal computer or phone. According to Clark, these interactions between a person and a form of technology integrate that technology into the cognitive process in a way that is analogous to the way that a technology that would fit the traditional concept of cyborg augmentation becomes integrated with its biological host. Because all humans in some way use technology to augment their cognitive processes, Clark comes to the conclusion that we are "natural-born cyborgs."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andy. 2004. ''Natural-Born Cyborgs''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Donna Haraway]] also theorizes that people, metaphorically or literally, have been cyborgs since the late [[20th century|twentieth century]]. If one considers the mind and body as one, much of humanity is aided with technology in almost every way, which hybridizes humans with technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Kotásek |first=Miroslav |date=2015 |title=Artificial intelligence in science fiction as a model of the posthuman situation of mankind |url=http://www.wls.sav.sk/wp-content/uploads/WLS4_2015_Kotasek.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future scope and regulation of implantable technologies ==
{{See also|Mobile security|Medical device#Regulation and oversight}}
Given the technical scope of current and future implantable [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory]]/[[Telemetry|telemetric]] devices, such devices will be greatly proliferated, and will have connections to commercial, medical, and governmental networks. For example, in the medical sector, patients will be able to log in to their home computer, and thus visit virtual doctor's offices, medical databases, and receive medical prognoses from the comfort of their own home from the data collected through their implanted telemetric devices.&lt;ref name="Carvalko2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carvalko|first1=J.R.|title=Law and policy in an era of cyborg-assisted-life: The implications of interfacing in-the-body technologies to the outer world|date=30 September 2013|journal=IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS)|isbn=978-1-4799-0929-2|page=206|chapter=Law and policy in an era of cyborg-assisted-life&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: The implications of interfacing in-the-body technologies to the outer world&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|doi=10.1109/ISTAS.2013.6613121|s2cid=17421383}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this online network presents large security concerns because it has been proven by several U.S. universities that hackers could get onto these networks and shut down peoples' electronic prosthetics.&lt;ref name="Carvalko2013" /&gt; [[Cyborg data mining]] refers to the collection of data produced by implantable devices.

More than 50 of the firm's 85 employees were chipped. It was confirmed that the [[Food and Drug Administration|American Food and Drug Administration]] approved of these implantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eastabrook|first1=Diane|date=2 August 2017|title=US: Wisconsin company offers optional microchips for employees|agency=Al-Jazeera|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/news/2017/08/us-wisconsin-company-offers-optional-microchips-employees-170802074308766.html|access-date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these devices are to be proliferated within society, then the question that begs to be answered is what regulatory agency will oversee the operations, monitoring, and security of these devices? According to this case study of Three Square Market, it seems that the FDA is assuming a role in regulating and monitoring these devices. It has been argued that a new regulatory framework needs to be developed so that the law keeps up with developments in implantable technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramanauskas|first=Ben|date=2020|title=BDSM, body modification, transhumanism, and the limits of liberalism|journal=Economic Affairs|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=85–92|doi=10.1111/ecaf.12394|issn=1468-0270|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyborg Foundation ==
In 2010, the [[Cyborg Foundation]] became the world's first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs.&lt;ref&gt;García, F.C.

In 2012, Spanish film director Rafel Duran Torrent, created a short film about the Cyborg Foundation. In 2013, the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]'s Focus Forward Filmmakers Competition and was awarded US$100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Pond, Steve [https://http "Cyborg Foundation" wins $100K Focus Forward prize]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114075411/https://http/|date=14 January 2016}}, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 22 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
{{See also|Cyberpunk|List of fictional cyborgs}}
[[File:Cyborg elf, science fantasy, Stable Diffusion AI art.png|thumb|Cultural portraying of a cyborg, a [[science fantasy]] cyborg elf]]
Cyborgs have become a well-known part of science fiction literature and other media. Although many of these characters may be technically [[android (robot)|androids]], they are often erroneously referred to as cyborgs.

Perhaps the best known examples of cyborgs in popular culture are the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the [[Dalek]]s and [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] from ''[[Doctor Who]].'' Other prominent cyborgs include [[RoboCop]], [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]], characters from ''[[Universal Soldier (film series)|Universal Soldier]]'', [[United States Air Force]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Steve Austin (character)|Steve Austin]] in both the novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'' and, as acted out by [[Lee Majors]], ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]],'' the [[Replicants]] from ''[[Blade Runner]]'', [[Darth Vader]], [[Lobot]], and [[General Grievous]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' and the [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]]s from the 2004 ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series.

From [[American comic book]]s are characters including [[Deathlok]] and [[Cyborg (DC Comics)|Victor "Cyborg" Stone]]; and [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters including [[8 Man]] (the inspiration for ''RoboCop''), [[Kamen Rider]], ''[[Battle Tendency]]''{{'}}s [[Rudol von Stroheim]], and ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]''{{'}}s [[Motoko Kusanagi]].

[[Player character]]s such as [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]], [[Cyrax]], and [[Sektor]] from the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' franchise,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Kano - Best Cyborgs Of All Time|url=http://best-cyborgs-of-all-time-kano.html/|access-date=2020-09-23|website=best-cyborgs-of-all-time-kano.html|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MKWarehouse: Mortal Kombat 3|url=http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mk3/#fighters|access-date=2020-09-23|website=mortalkombatwarehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Genji (Overwatch)|Genji]], an advanced cyborg ninja, who appears in ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' and ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Chalk|first=Andy|date=2017-04-17|title=Genji is coming to Heroes of the Storm|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/genji-is-coming-to-heroes-of-the-storm/|access-date=2020-09-23|magazine=PC Gamer|language=en-US|quote=The cyborg ninja Genji will soon be the latest member of the Overwatch squad to take up the fight in Heroes of the Storm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of cyborgs in [[video game]]s. The ''[[Deus Ex (series)|Deus Ex]]'' video game series deals extensively with the near-future rise of cyborgs and their corporate ownership, as does the ''[[Syndicate (series)|Syndicate]]'' series.

William Gibson's ''[[Neuromancer]]'' features one of the first female cyborgs, a "Razorgirl" named [[Molly Millions]], who has extensive cybernetic modifications and is one of the most prolific [[cyberpunk]] characters in the science fiction canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuromancer|last=William|first=Gibson|publisher=Penguin|year=2016|location=S.I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyborg was also a central part of singer [[Janelle Monáe]]'s 48-minute video corresponding with the release of her 2018 album "[[Dirty Computer]]." This ''emotion picture'' intertwined the relationship between human and technology, highlighting the power of the digital on a futuristic, dystopian society. Monáe has previously referred to herself as an android, depicting herself as a mechanical organism often conforming to idealistic standards, thus using the cyborg as a way to detach from these oppressive structures.

'''Cycle of quantification/qualification''' (C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;) is a parameter used in [[real-time polymerase chain reaction]] techniques, indicating the cycle number where a PCR amplification curve meets a predefined mathematical criterion. A C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; may be used for quantification of the target sequence or to determine whether the target sequence is present or not.

Two criteria to determine the  C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; are used by different thermocyclers:
threshold cycle (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) is the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a given value threshold. Usually, the threshold is set above the baseline, about 10 times the [[standard deviation]] of the noise of the baseline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gene-quantification.com/real-time-pcr-handbook-life-technologies-update-flr.pdf |title=Life Technologies : Real-time PCR handbook |publisher=Gene-quantification.com |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid random effects on the C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the threshold shouldn't be set much higher than that to avoid reduced reproducibility due to uncontrolled factors.

Crossing point (Cp) and Take off point (TOP) are the cycle value of the maximum second derivative of the amplification curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Standardized determination of real-time PCR effciency from a single reaction set-up |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=2003 |volume=31 |publisher=Gene-quantification.com |doi=10.1093/nar/gng122|last1=Tichopad |first1=A. |last2=Dilger |first2=M. |last3=Schwarz |first3=G. |last4=Pfaffl |first4=M.

It occurs in small aquatic invertebrates that reproduce by [[parthenogenesis]] and give rise to several generations annually.
