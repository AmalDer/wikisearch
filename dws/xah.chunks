In [[forestry]] and [[ecology]], '''understory''' ([[American English]]), or '''understorey''' ([[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]]), also known as '''underbrush''' or '''undergrowth''', includes [[plant]] life growing beneath the [[Canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] without penetrating it to any great extent, but above the [[forest floor]]. Only a small percentage of light penetrates the canopy so understory vegetation is generally [[Shade tolerance|shade-tolerant]]. The understory typically consists of trees stunted through lack of light, other small trees with low light requirements, saplings, shrubs, vines and undergrowth. Small trees such as [[holly]] and [[Cornus (genus)|dogwood]] are understory specialists.

In [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|temperate deciduous forests]], many understory plants start into growth earlier in the year than the canopy trees, to make use of the greater availability of light at that particular time of year. A gap in the canopy caused by the death of a tree stimulates the potential emergent trees into competitive growth as they grow upwards to fill the gap. These trees tend to have straight trunks and few lower branches. At the same time, the bushes, undergrowth, and plant life on the forest floor become denser. The understory experiences greater humidity than the canopy, and the shaded ground does not vary in temperature as much as open ground. This causes a proliferation of [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, and [[fungi]] and encourages [[biogeochemical cycle|nutrient recycling]], which provides favorable [[habitat]]s for many [[animal]]s and plants.

==Understory structure==
The understory is the underlying layer of vegetation in a forest or wooded area, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor. 
[[Plant]]s in the understory comprise an assortment of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees together with [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist]] understory [[shrub]]s and herbs. Young canopy [[tree]]s often persist in the understory for decades as suppressed juveniles until an opening in the forest overstory permits their growth into the canopy. In contrast understory [[shrub]]s complete their [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] in the shade of the forest canopy. Some smaller tree species, such as [[dogwood]] and [[holly]], rarely grow tall and generally are understory trees.

The canopy of a [[tropical forest]]s are typically about 10m thick, and intercepts around 95% of the sunlight.&lt;ref name=Garden.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Light in the Rain Forest|url=http://assoc.garden.org/courseweb/course1/week4/page5a.htm |website=garden.org |access-date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understory therefore receives less intense light than plants in the canopy and such light as does penetrate is impoverished in [[wavelength]]s of light that are most effective for photosynthesis. Understory plants therefore must be [[shade tolerant]]&amp;mdash;they must be able to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] adequately using such light as does reach their leaves.  They often are able to use wavelengths that canopy plants cannot. In [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate deciduous forests]] towards the end of the leafless season, understory plants take advantage of the shelter of the still leafless canopy plants to "leaf out" before the canopy trees do. This is important because it provides the understory plants with a window in which to photosynthesize without the canopy shading them. This brief period (usually 1&amp;ndash;2 weeks) is often a crucial period in which the plant can maintain a net positive [[carbon cycle|carbon balance]] over the course of the year.

As a rule forest understories also experience higher [[humidity]] than exposed areas. The forest canopy reduces solar radiation, so the ground does not heat up or cool down as rapidly as open ground. Consequently, the understory dries out more slowly than more exposed areas do. The greater humidity encourages [[epiphyte]]s such as ferns and mosses, and allows [[fungi]] and other decomposers to flourish. This drives [[biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]], and provides favorable [[microclimate]]s for many [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s, such as the [[pygmy marmoset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1-link=David M.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Exoprosopa nondescript.jpg|thumb|upright|According to the [[entomology|entomologist]] Andy Calderwood, this fly of the genus ''[[Exoprosopa]]'' belongs to an undescribed species (as of September, 2009).]]
In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], an '''undescribed taxon''' is a [[taxon]] (for example, a [[species]]) that has been discovered, but not yet formally described and named. The various [[Nomenclature Codes]] specify the requirements for a new taxon to be validly described and named. Until such a [[Diagnosis (taxonomy)|description]] has been published, the taxon has no formal or official name, although a temporary, informal name is often used. A [[Academic publishing|published]] [[scientific name]] may not fulfil the requirements of the Codes for various reasons. For example, if the taxon was not adequately [[Species description|described]], its name is called a ''[[nomen nudum]]''. It is possible for a taxon to be "undescribed" for an extensive period of time, even if unofficial descriptions are published.

An undescribed species may be referred to with the genus name, followed by "sp"., but this [[abbreviation]] is also used to label specimens or images that are too incomplete to be identified at the species [[Taxonomic rank|level]]. In some cases, there is more than one undescribed species in a genus. In this case, these are often referred to by a number or letter. In the shark genus ''[[Pristiophorus]]'', for example, there were, for some time, four undescribed species, informally named ''Pristiophorus'' sp. A, B, C and D. (In 2008, sp. A was described as ''[[Eastern_Australian_sawshark|Pristiophorus peroniensis]]'' and sp. B as ''[[Tropical_sawshark|P. delicatus]]''.) When a formal description for species C or D is published, its temporary name will be replaced with a proper [[binomial name]].

==Provisional names in bacteriology==
In [[bacteriology]], a valid publication of a name requires the deposition of the bacteria in a Bacteriology Culture Collection. Species for which this is impossible cannot receive a valid binomial name; these species are classified as [[Candidatus]].

==Provisional names in botany==
A provisional name for a species may consist of the number or of some other designation of a [[Biological specimen|specimen]] in a [[herbarium]] or other collection. It may also consist of the genus name followed by such a specimen identifier or by a provisional [[botanical name|specific epithet]] which is enclosed by quotation marks. In the latter case, the [[Author citation (botany)|author citation]] may be replaced by the [[Latin]] [[Jargon|term]] ''ineditus'' or ''ined.'', meaning "unpublished". As of 2013, many species of the [[flowering plant]] genus ''[[Polyscias]]'' can be found in the [[scientific literature]] under such a designation.&lt;ref name="tropicospolyscias"&gt;''Polyscias'' in [[Tropicos]]. (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; An enquoted name, however, is not necessarily unpublished. It may be an [[Nomen illegitimum|illegitimate name]] that has not yet been replaced by a [[Correct name (botany)|correct name]]. For example, the [[botanical name|name]] "Endressia" ([[sensu]] Whiffin) was published in 2007 for a genus in family Monimiaceae, but is an illegitimate homonym of ''Endressia'' J.Gay in family Apiaceae. In 2010, it was noted as illegitimate, but still used with quotation marks.&lt;ref name=renner2010&gt;Susanne S. Renner, Joeri S. Strijk, Dominique Strasberg, and Christophe Thébaud. 2010. "Biogeography of the Monimiaceae (Laurales): a role for East Gondwana and long-distance dispersal, but not West Gondwana". ''Journal of Biogeography'' '''37'''(7):1227-1238. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was replaced with ''Pendressia'' in 2018.&lt;ref name="ipnipendressia"&gt;[[International Plant Names Index]]. ''[https://www.ipni.org/n/77195328-1 Pendressia].'' Retrieved 2020-08-26. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2992" xml:space="preserve">The '''universality–diversity paradigm''' is the analysis of [[Biogenic substance|biological materials]] based on the universality and diversity of its fundamental structural elements and functional mechanisms. The analysis of biological systems based on this classification has been a cornerstone of modern [[biology]].

For example, [[protein]]s constitute the elementary building blocks of a vast variety of biological materials such as [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[spider silk]] or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by [[self-organization]] of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro. Some of the structural features are commonly found in many different tissues, that is, they are [[Conserved sequence|conservation|highly conserved]]. Examples of such universal building blocks include [[alpha-helices]], [[beta-sheet]]s or [[tropocollagen]] molecules. In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particular [[Protein filament|filament]] assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or [[tendon]] fascicles. This coexistence of universality and diversity—referred to as the universality–diversity paradigm (UDP)—is an overarching feature in biological materials and a crucial component of [[materiomics]]. It might provide guidelines for bioinspired and [[biomimetic]] material development, where this concept is translated into the use of inorganic or hybrid organic-inorganic building blocks.

{{Vaccination}}

'''Vaccination''' is the administration of a [[vaccine]] to help the [[immune system]] develop immunity from a disease. Vaccines contain a [[microorganism]] or [[virus]] in a weakened, live or killed state, or [[protein]]s or [[toxin]]s from the organism. In stimulating the body's [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]], they help prevent sickness from an [[infectious disease]]. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, [[herd immunity]] results. Herd immunity protects those who may be immunocompromised and cannot get a vaccine because even a weakened version would harm them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Herd immunity (Herd protection) {{!}} Vaccine Knowledge|url=https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/herd-immunity|access-date=12 November 2020|website=vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Fiore AE, Bridges CB, Cox J |title=Vaccines for Pandemic Influenza |chapter=Seasonal influenza vaccines |journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |volume=333 |pages=43–82 |year=2009 |pmid=19768400 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92165-3_3 |isbn=978-3-540-92164-6|s2cid=33549265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang Y, Brewer NT, Rinas AC, Schmitt K, Smith JS | title = Evaluating the impact of human papillomavirus vaccines | journal = Vaccine | volume = 27 | issue = 32 | pages = 4355–62 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19515467 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liesegang TJ | title = Varicella zoster virus vaccines: effective, but concerns linger | journal = Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 379–84 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19606157 | doi = 10.3129/i09-126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work | title = A CDC framework for preventing infectious diseases | url = https://www.cdc.gov/oid/docs/ID-Framework.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120914102409/https://www.cdc.gov/oid/docs/ID-Framework.pdf | archive-date = 14 September 2012 | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = October 2011 | quote = Vaccines are our most effective and cost-saving tools for disease prevention, preventing untold suffering and saving tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs each year }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Gellin B | title = Vaccines and Infectious Diseases: Putting Risk into Perspective | url = https://iaomt.org/TestFoundation/lifesaver.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101124130606/https://iaomt.org/TestFoundation/lifesaver.htm | archive-date = 24 November 2010 | work = American Medical Association Briefing on Microbial Threats | location = National Press Club Washington, DC  | date = 1 June 2000 | quote = Vaccines are the most effective public health tool ever created. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vaccine-preventable diseases | date = 7 October 2002 | url = http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/vpd-mev/index-eng.php | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120324030536/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/vpd-mev/index-eng.php | archive-date = 24 March 2012 | quote = Vaccines still provide the most effective, longest-lasting method of preventing infectious diseases in all age groups | publisher = Public Health Agency of Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) | url = http://virtualbiosecuritycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Library-NIAID-Biodefense-Research-Agenda-for-Category-B-and-C-Priority-Pathogens.pdf | title = NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda for Category B and C Priority Pathogens | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065419/http://virtualbiosecuritycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Library-NIAID-Biodefense-Research-Agenda-for-Category-B-and-C-Priority-Pathogens.pdf | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | quote = Vaccines are the most effective method of protecting the public against infectious diseases. }}&lt;/ref&gt; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the [[Eradication of infectious diseases|worldwide eradication]] of [[smallpox]] and the elimination of diseases such as [[polio]] and [[tetanus]] from much of the world. However, some diseases, such as [[2019 Pacific Northwest measles outbreak|measles outbreaks]] in America, have seen rising cases due to relatively low vaccination rates in the 2010s – attributed, in part, to [[vaccine hesitancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phadke VK, Bednarczyk RA, Salmon DA, Omer SB | title = Association Between Vaccine Refusal and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases in the United States: A Review of Measles and Pertussis | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 11 | pages = 1149–58 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26978210 | pmc = 5007135 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.1353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), vaccination prevents 3.5–5&amp;nbsp;million deaths per year.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Vaccines and immunization |url=https://www.who.int/health-topics/vaccines-and-immunization |access-date=2022-09-18 |website=[[World Health Organization]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first disease people tried to prevent by [[inoculation]] was most likely smallpox, with the first recorded use of [[variolation]] occurring in the 16th century in China.{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=60}} It was also the first disease for which a vaccine was produced.&lt;ref name="pmid17633292"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lombard M, Pastoret PP, Moulin AM | s2cid = 6688481 | title = A brief history of vaccines and vaccination | journal = Revue Scientifique et Technique | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–48 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17633292 | doi = 10.20506/rst.26.1.1724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6319980"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Behbehani AM | title = The smallpox story: life and death of an old disease | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 47 | issue = 4 | pages = 455–509 | date = December 1983 | pmid = 6319980 | pmc = 281588 | doi =  10.1128/MMBR.47.4.455-509.1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although at least six people had used the same principles years earlier, the [[smallpox vaccine]] was invented in 1796 by English physician [[Edward Jenner]].

''Vaccination'' and ''[[immunization]]'' have a similar meaning in everyday language. This is distinct from [[inoculation]], which uses unweakened live pathogens. Vaccination efforts have been met with [[Vaccine controversy|some reluctance]] on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, and religious grounds, although no major religions oppose vaccination, and some consider it an obligation due to the potential to save lives.&lt;ref name="nyt19"&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McNeil DG |title=Religious Objections to the Measles Vaccine?

Early success brought widespread acceptance, and mass vaccination campaigns have greatly reduced the incidence of many diseases in numerous geographic regions.

Vaccines are a way of [[artificial induction of immunity|artificially activating the immune system]] to protect against [[infectious disease]]. The activation occurs through priming the [[immune system]] with an [[immunogen]].  Stimulating immune responses with an infectious agent is known as ''[[immunization]]''. Vaccination includes various ways of administering immunogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kwong PD | title = What Are the Most Powerful Immunogen Design Vaccine Strategies?

Most vaccines are administered before a patient has contracted a disease to help increase future protection. However, some vaccines are administered after the patient already has contracted a disease. Vaccines given after exposure to smallpox are reported to offer some protection from disease or may reduce the severity of disease.&lt;ref name="CDCvac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |title=Vaccine Overview |access-date=2 January 2008 |website=Smallpox Fact Sheet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102234114/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[rabies]] immunization was given by [[Louis Pasteur]] to a child after he was bitten by a [[Rabies|rabid]] dog. Since its discovery, the rabies vaccine has been proven effective in preventing rabies in humans when administered several times over 14 days along with rabies [[immune globulin]] and wound care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rupprecht CE, Briggs D, Brown CM, Franka R, Katz SL, Kerr HD, Lett SM, Levis R, Meltzer MI, Schaffner W, Cieslak PR | display-authors = 6 | title = Use of a reduced (4-dose) vaccine schedule for postexposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices | journal = MMWR.

Most vaccines are given by injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the [[intestines]]. Live attenuated polio, rotavirus, some typhoid, and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel. While vaccination provides a lasting effect, it usually takes several weeks to develop. This differs from [[passive immunity]] (the transfer of [[antibodies]], such as in breastfeeding), which has immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/immunity-types.htm|title=Immunity Types|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]| access-date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vaccine failure is when an [[organism]] contracts a disease in spite of being vaccinated against it. Primary [[vaccine]] failure occurs when an organism's [[immune system]] does not produce [[antibody|antibodies]] when first vaccinated. Vaccines can fail when several series are given and fail to produce an immune response. The term "vaccine failure" does not necessarily imply that the vaccine is defective. Most vaccine failures are simply from individual variations in immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedermann U, Garner-Spitzer E, Wagner A | title = Primary vaccine failure to routine vaccines: Why and what to do? | journal = Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 239–43 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26836329 | pmc = 4962729 | doi = 10.1080/21645515.2015.1093263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccination versus inoculation===
The term "[[inoculation]]" is often used interchangeably with "vaccination." However, while related, the terms are not synonymous.  Vaccination is treatment of an individual with an attenuated (i.e. less virulent) [[pathogen]] or other [[immunogen]], whereas inoculation, also called [[variolation]] in the context of [[smallpox]] prophylaxis, is treatment with unattenuated variola virus taken from a pustule or scab of a smallpox patient into the superficial layers of the skin, commonly the upper arm. Variolation was often done 'arm-to-arm' or, less effectively, 'scab-to-arm', and often caused the patient to become infected with smallpox, which in some cases resulted in severe disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/doctors/diff.html|title=The Smallpox Epidemic of 1862 (Victoria BC)--Doctors and Diagnosis|website=web.uvic.ca|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/doctors/diff.html |title=Doctors and diagnosis ''The difference between Vaccination and Inoculation'' |publisher=Web.uvic.ca |access-date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaccinations began in the late 18th century with the work of [[Edward Jenner]] and the smallpox vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Edward Jenner – (1749–1823) |publisher=Sundaytimes.lk. |date=1 June 2008 |url=http://sundaytimes.lk/080601/FunDay/famous.html |access-date=28 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926095825/http://sundaytimes.lk/080601/FunDay/famous.html |archive-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jenner_edward.shtml |title=History – Edward Jenner (1749–1823) |publisher=BBC |access-date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinweb.org/dinweb/DINMuseum/Edward%20Jenner.asp|title=Edward Jenner – Smallpox and the Discovery of Vaccination|website=dinweb.org|access-date=22 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827080455/http://www.dinweb.org/dinweb/DINMuseum/Edward%20Jenner.asp|archive-date=27 August 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventing disease versus preventing infection===

Some vaccines, like the smallpox vaccine, prevent infection. Their use results in [[sterilizing immunity]] and can help eradicate a disease if there is no animal reserve. Other vaccines help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/coronavirus-few-vaccines-prevent-infection-heres-why-thats-not-problem|title = Coronavirus: Few vaccines prevent infection – here's why that's not a problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaccine development and approval ===
Just like any medication or procedure, no vaccine can be 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person's body can react differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/history/index.html|title=History of Vaccine Safety History {{!}} Ensuring Safety {{!}} Vaccine Safety {{!}} CDC|date=10 January 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen RT, Hibbs B | s2cid = 13364842 | title = Vaccine safety: current and future challenges | journal = Pediatric Annals | volume = 27 | issue = 7 | pages = 445–55 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9677616 | doi = 10.3928/0090-4481-19980701-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While minor [[side effect]]s, such as soreness or low grade fever, are relatively common, serious side effects are very rare and occur in about 1 out of every 100,000 vaccinations and typically involve [[Allergy|allergic reactions]] that can cause hives or difficulty breathing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/making-safe-vaccines|title=Making Safe Vaccines {{!}} NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|website=www.niaid.nih.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm|title=Vaccines: Vac-Gen/Side Effects|date=12 July 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, vaccines are the safest they ever have been in history and each vaccine undergoes rigorous clinical trials to ensure their safety and [[Vaccine efficacy|efficacy]] before approval by authorities such as the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/index.html|title=Ensuring Vaccine Safety Ensuring Safety {{!}} Vaccine Safety {{!}} CDC|date=12 December 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to human testing, vaccines are tested on [[cell culture]]s and the results modelled to assess how they will interact with the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; During the next round of testing, researchers study vaccines in animals, including [[Mouse|mice]], [[rabbit]]s, [[guinea pig]]s, and [[monkey]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Vaccines that pass each of these stages of testing are then approved by the public health safety authority (FDA in the United States) to start a three-phase series of human testing, advancing to higher phases only if they are deemed safe and effective at the previous phase. The people in these trials participate voluntarily and are required to prove they understand the purpose of the study and the potential risks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During phase I trials, a vaccine is tested in a group of about 20 people with the primary goal of assessing the vaccine's safety.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Phase II trials expand the testing to include 50 to several hundred people. During this stage, the vaccine's safety continues to be evaluated and researchers also gather data on the effectiveness and the ideal dose of the vaccine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Vaccines determined to be safe and efficacious then advance to phase III trials, which focuses on the efficacy of the vaccine in hundreds to thousands of volunteers. This phase can take several years to complete and researchers use this opportunity to compare the vaccinated volunteers to those who have not been vaccinated to highlight any true reactions to the vaccine that occur.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

If a vaccine passes all of the phases of testing, the manufacturer can then apply for license of the vaccine through the FDA. Before the FDA approves use in the general public, they extensively review the results to the clinical trials, safety tests, purity tests, and manufacturing methods and establish that the manufacturer itself is up to government standards in many other areas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, safety testing of the vaccines never ends.

After FDA approval, the FDA continues to monitor the manufacturing protocols, batch purity, and the manufacturing facility itself. Additionally, most vaccines also undergo phase IV trials, which monitors the safety and efficacy of vaccines in tens of thousands of people, or more, across many years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This allows for delayed or very rare reactions to be detected and evaluated.

=== Side effects ===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has compiled a list of vaccines and their possible side effects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The risk of side effects varies from one vaccine to the next, but below are examples of side effects and their approximate rate of occurrence with the [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)]] vaccine, a common childhood vaccine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Mild side effects (common)'''

* Mild fever (1 in 4)
* Redness, soreness, swelling at the injection site (1 in 4)
* Fatigue, poor appetite (1 in 10)
* Vomiting (1 in 50)

'''Moderate side effects (uncommon)'''

* Seizure (1 in 14,000)
* High fever (over 105&amp;nbsp;°F) (1 in 16,000)

'''Severe side effects (rare)'''

* Serious allergic reaction (1 in 1,000,000)
* Other severe problems including long-term seizure, coma, brain damage have been reported, but are so rare that it is not possible to tell if they are from the vaccine or not.

Certain vaccines have had adverse outcomes identified after being used in [[mass vaccination]] programs:
**In 1976 in the United States, a mass [[1976 swine flu outbreak|a swine flu vaccination programme]] was discontinued after 362 cases of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] among 45 million vaccinated people. [[William Foege]] of the CDC estimated that the incidence of Guillain-Barré was four times higher in vaccinated people than in those not receiving the swine flu vaccine.
**[[Dengvaxia]], the only approved vaccine for [[Dengue fever]], was found to increase the risk of hospitalization for Dengue fever by 1.58 times in children of 9 years or younger, resulting in the suspension of a mass vaccination program in the Philippines in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redoni M, Yacoub S, Rivino L, Giacobbe DR, Luzzati R, Di Bella S | title = Dengue: Status of current and under-development vaccines | journal = Reviews in Medical Virology | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = e2101 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32101634 | doi = 10.1002/rmv.2101 | hdl-access = free | s2cid = 211536962 | hdl = 1983/6d38d9b6-8e1b-4a84-85e3-edab4fc41957 | url = https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/6d38d9b6-8e1b-4a84-85e3-edab4fc41957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ingredients ===
The ingredients of vaccines can vary greatly from one to the next and no two vaccines are the same. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has compiled a list of vaccines and their ingredients that is readily accessible on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm|title=Vaccines: Vac-Gen/Additives in Vaccines Fact Sheet|date=12 July 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=15 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aluminium ====
[[Aluminium]] is an adjuvant ingredient in some vaccines. An adjuvant is a type of ingredient that is used to help the body's immune system create a stronger immune response after receiving the vaccination.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html|title=Adjuvants help vaccines work better. {{!}} Vaccine Safety {{!}} CDC|date=23 January 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=15 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium is in a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] form (the ionic version of an element) and is used in the following compounds: [[aluminium hydroxide]], [[aluminium phosphate]], and [[aluminium potassium sulfate]]. For a given element, the [[ion]] form has different properties from the elemental form. Although it is possible to have [[Aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis|aluminium toxicity]], aluminium salts have been used effectively and safely since the 1930s when they were first used with the [[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus]] vaccines.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although there is a small increase in the chance of having a local reaction to a vaccine with an aluminium salt (redness, soreness, and swelling), there is no increased risk of any serious reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jefferson T, Rudin M, Di Pietrantonj C | title = Adverse events after immunisation with aluminium-containing DTP vaccines: systematic review of the evidence | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 84–90 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14871632 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(04)00927-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitkus RJ, King DB, Hess MA, Forshee RA, Walderhaug MO | title = Updated aluminum pharmacokinetics following infant exposures through diet and vaccination | journal = Vaccine | volume = 29 | issue = 51 | pages = 9538–43 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22001122 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.09.124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mercury ====
Certain vaccines once contained a compound called [[thiomersal]] or thimerosal, which is an [[organic compound]] containing [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. [[Organomercury]] is commonly found in two forms. The [[methylmercury]] cation (with one carbon atom) is found in mercury-contaminated fish and is the form that people might ingest in mercury-polluted areas ([[Minamata disease]]), whereas the [[ethylmercury]] cation (with two carbon atoms) is present in thimerosal, linked to [[thiosalicylic acid|thiosalicylate]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html|title=Thimerosal in Vaccines Thimerosal {{!}} Concerns {{!}} Vaccine Safety {{!}} CDC|date=24 January 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both are organomercury compounds, they do not have the same chemical properties and interact with the human body differently.  Ethylmercury is cleared from the body faster than methylmercury and is less likely to cause toxic effects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Thimerosal was used as a [[preservative]] to prevent the growth of [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]] in vials that contain more than one dose of a vaccine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This helps reduce the risk of potential [[infection]]s or serious illness that could occur from [[contamination]] of a vaccine vial.  Although there was a small increase in risk of injection site redness and swelling with vaccines containing thimerosal, there was no increased risk of serious harm or [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ball LK, Ball R, Pratt RD | title = An assessment of thimerosal use in childhood vaccines | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 107 | issue = 5 | pages = 1147–54 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11331700 | doi = 10.1542/peds.107.5.1147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228#bib|title=Vaccine Safety &amp; Availability - Thimerosal and Vaccines | author = Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research |website=www.fda.gov|access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though evidence supports the safety and efficacy of thimerosal in vaccines, thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001 as a precaution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5&amp;nbsp;million deaths per year,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.&lt;ref name="WHO_vaccination_report"&gt;{{cite web | title= Global Immunization Data |url=https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/global_immunization_data.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; They estimate that 29% of deaths of children under five-years-old in 2013 were vaccine preventable. In other developing parts of the world, they are faced with the challenge of having a decreased availability of resources and vaccinations. Countries such as those in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] cannot afford to provide the full range of childhood vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehreth J | title = The global value of vaccination | journal = Vaccine | volume = 21 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 596–600 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12531324 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00623-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Vaccines have led to major decreases in the prevalence of infectious diseases in the United States. In 2007, studies regarding the effectiveness of vaccines on mortality or morbidity rates of those exposed to various diseases have shown almost 100% decreases in death rates, and about a 90% decrease in exposure rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roush SW, Murphy TV | title = Historical comparisons of morbidity and mortality for vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States | journal = JAMA | volume = 298 | issue = 18 | pages = 2155–63 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18000199 | doi = 10.1001/jama.298.18.2155 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed specific organizations and states to adopt standards for recommended early childhood vaccinations. Lower income families who are unable to otherwise afford vaccinations are supported by these organizations and specific government laws. The [[Vaccines for Children Program]] and the [[Social Security Act]] are two major players in supporting lower socioeconomic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html |publisher=CDC |access-date=8 December 2019|date=2 April 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Program for Distribution of Pediatric Vaccines |url=https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1928.htm |website=Social Security |publisher=U.S. Government |access-date=8 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the CDC declared that measles had been eliminated in the US (defined as no disease transmission for 12 continuous months).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html|title=Measles {{!}} History of Measles {{!}} CDC|date=25 February 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=28 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the growing [[Vaccine hesitancy|anti-vaccine movement]], the US has seen a resurgence of certain [[vaccine-preventable diseases]]. The measles virus has now lost its elimination status in the US as the number of measles cases continues to rise in recent years with a total of 17 outbreaks in 2018 and 465 outbreaks in 2019 (as of 4 April 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html|title=Measles {{!}} Cases and Outbreaks {{!}} CDC|date=24 March 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=28 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|Inoculation#Origins}}
[[File:Edward Jenner, testimonial to the efficacy of vaccination. Wellcome L0020705.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An 1802 testimonial to the efficacy of vaccination, presented to its pioneer, [[Edward Jenner]], and signed by 112 members of the [[Physical Society of London|Physical Society, London]].]]

Before the first vaccinations, in the sense of using [[cowpox]] to inoculate people against [[smallpox]], people have been inoculated in China and elsewhere, before being copied in [[Western world|the west]], by using smallpox, called [[variolation]]. The earliest hints of the practice of variolation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 6 154"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Needham J |title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology, Part 6, Medicine|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521632621|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, which comes from [[Wan Quan]]'s (1499–1582) Douzhen Xinfa (痘疹心法) of 1549. They implemented a method of "nasal [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]]" administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China.&lt;ref name="Williams2010"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Williams G |title=Angel of Death|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-27471-6|location=Basingstoke c}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} Two reports on the Chinese practice of [[inoculation]] were received by the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1700; one by [[Martin Lister]] who received a report by an employee of the [[East India Company]] stationed in China and another by [[Clopton Havers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Silverstein AM |title=A History of Immunology|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=9780080919461|edition=2nd|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Voltaire]] reports that the Chinese have practiced variolation "these hundred years".

In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]], a doctor in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]] in [[Gloucestershire]], England, tested a common theory that a person who had contracted cowpox would be immune from smallpox. To test the theory, he took cowpox [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicle]]s from a [[milkmaid]] named Sarah Nelmes with which he infected an eight-year-old boy named [[James Phipps]], and two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox, and smallpox did not develop. In 1798, Jenner published ''[[wikisource:An Inquiry Into the Causes and Effects of the Variolæ Vaccinæ|An Inquiry Into the Causes and Effects of the Variolæ Vaccinæ]]'' which created widespread interest. He distinguished 'true' and 'spurious' cowpox (which did not give the desired effect) and developed an "arm-to-arm" method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual's [[Skin condition|pustule]]. Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox, but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material, by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100,000 people were vaccinated.&lt;ref name="GrossSepkowitz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross CP, Sepkowitz KA | title = The myth of the medical breakthrough: smallpox, vaccination, and Jenner reconsidered | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–60 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9831677 | doi = 10.1016/s1201-9712(98)90096-0 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''vaccination'' was coined in 1800 by the surgeon Richard Dunning in his text ''Some observations on vaccination''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | vauthors = Dunning R | date = 1800 | publisher = March and Teape |url=https://curiosity.lib.harvard.edu/contagion/catalog/36-990061255320203941 |title=Some observations on vaccination, or, The inoculated cow-pox; Some observations on vaccination; Inoculated cow-pox; Observations, &amp; c; Observations, &amp;c|website=Contagion – CURIOSity Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vaccination campaign was started in the new British colony of [[Ceylon]] in 1803. By 1807 the British had vaccinated more than a million Indians and [[Sri Lankans]] against smallpox.&lt;ref name = "Bennett_2016" /&gt;{{rp|244}} Also in 1803 the Spanish [[Balmis Expedition]] launched the first transcontinental effort to vaccinate people against smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-07-27|title=Exhibition tells story of Spanish children used as vaccine fridges in 1803|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/27/spanish-museum-celebrates-pioneer-who-took-smallpox-vaccine-to-colonies|access-date=2021-07-31|website=the Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a smallpox epidemic in 1816 the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] ordered smallpox vaccine and requested the English veterinarian [[William Moorcroft (explorer)|William Moorcroft]] to help in launching a vaccination campaign.&lt;ref name = "Bennett_2016" /&gt;{{rp|265–266}} In the same year a law was passed in Sweden to require the vaccination of children against smallpox by the age of two. [[Prussia]] briefly introduced compulsory vaccination in 1810 and again in the 1920s, but decided against a compulsory vaccination law in 1829. A law on compulsory smallpox vaccination was introduced in the [[Province of Hanover]] in the 1820s. In 1826, in [[Kragujevac]], future prince Mihailo of [[Serbia]] was the first person to be vaccinated against smallpox in the principality of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kragujevacke.rs/DRUSTVO/ISTORIJA-VAKCINACIJA-U-SRBIJI/|title=Prvo vakcinisanje u Kragujevcu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a smallpox epidemic in 1837 that caused 40,000 deaths, the [[British government]] initiated a concentrated [[vaccination policy]], starting with the [[Vaccination Act]] of 1840, which provided for universal vaccination and prohibited [[variolation]].&lt;ref name = "Bennett_2016" /&gt;{{rp|365}} The Vaccination Act 1853 introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination in England and Wales.&lt;ref name = "Brunton_2008"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Vaccination: Practice and Policy in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, 1800-1874 | vauthors = Brunton D |publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2008|isbn=9781580460361}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}} The law followed a severe outbreak of smallpox in 1851 and 1852.

In the United States of America compulsory vaccination laws were upheld in the 1905 landmark case [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The Supreme Court ruled that laws could require vaccination to protect the public from dangerous communicable diseases. However, in practice the United States had the lowest rate of vaccination among industrialized nations in the early 20th century. Compulsory vaccination laws began to be enforced in the United States after [[World War II]]. In 1959 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) called for the [[Smallpox|eradication of smallpox]] worldwide, as smallpox was still endemic in 33 countries. In the 1960s six to eight children died each year in the United States from vaccination-related complications. According to the WHO there were in 1966 about 100&amp;nbsp;million cases of smallpox worldwide, causing an estimated two million deaths. In the 1970s there was such a small risk of contracting smallpox that the [[United States Public Health Service]] recommended for routine smallpox vaccination to be ended. By 1974 the WHO smallpox vaccination program had confined smallpox to parts of [[Pakistan]], India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. In 1977 the WHO recorded the last case of smallpox infection acquired outside a laboratory in Somalia. In 1980 the WHO officially declared the world free of smallpox.&lt;ref name = "Magner_2009" /&gt;{{rp|115–116}}

In 1974 the WHO adopted the goal of universal vaccination by 1990 to protect children against six preventable [[infectious diseases]]: [[measles]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[diphtheria]], [[whooping cough]], [[tetanus]], and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name = "Magner_2009" /&gt;{{rp|119}} In the 1980s only 20 to 40% of children in developing countries were vaccinated against these six diseases. In wealthy nations the number of measles cases had dropped dramatically after the introduction of the [[measles vaccine]] in 1963. WHO figures demonstrate that in many countries a decline in measles vaccination leads to a resurgence in measles cases.

In 2000, the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]] was established to strengthen routine vaccinations and introduce new and under-used vaccines in countries with a per capita GDP of under US$1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaupart P, Dipple L, Dercon S |date=3 December 2019 |title=Has Gavi lived up to its promise?

==Vaccination policy==
{{Main|Vaccination policy}}
[[File:DTP-Vaccination-rate-by-US-State-and-exemption-status-1.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Vaccination rate by US state, including exemptions allowed by state in 2017]]
To eliminate the risk of [[Disease outbreak|outbreaks]] of some diseases, at various times governments and other institutions have employed policies requiring vaccination for all people. For example, an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in England and Wales, with fines levied on people who did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Brunton D |title=The Politics of Vaccination: Practice and Policy in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, 1800–1874 |date=2008 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common contemporary U.S. vaccination policies require that children receive recommended vaccinations before entering public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State Vaccination Requirements |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/laws/state-reqs.html |publisher=CDC |access-date=7 December 2019|date=11 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with early vaccination in the nineteenth century, these policies were resisted by a variety of groups, collectively called [[antivaccinationist]]s, who object on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, [[vaccination and religion|religious]], and other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tolley K |title=School Vaccination Wars |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2019 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=161–194 |doi=10.1017/heq.2019.3|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common objections are that vaccinations do not work, that compulsory vaccination constitutes excessive government intervention in personal matters, or that the proposed vaccinations are not sufficiently safe.&lt;ref name="wolfesharp"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe RM, Sharp LK | title = Anti-vaccinationists past and present | journal = BMJ | volume = 325 | issue = 7361 | pages = 430–2 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12193361 | pmc = 1123944 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern vaccination policies allow exemptions for people who have compromised immune systems, allergies to the components used in vaccinations or strongly held objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmon DA, Teret SP, MacIntyre CR, Salisbury D, Burgess MA, Halsey NA | s2cid = 19344405 | title = Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions: past, present, and future | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9508 | pages = 436–42 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16458770 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68144-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries with limited financial resources, limited vaccination coverage results in greater morbidity and mortality due to infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mhatre SL, Schryer-Roy AM | title = The fallacy of coverage: uncovering disparities to improve immunization rates through evidence.

In Australia, for example, the Government subsidizes vaccinations for seniors and indigenous Australians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.org.au/consumers/publications/medicines_talk/medicinestalk_no._32_summer_2009/time_to_think_about_vaccinations_again "Time to think about vaccinations again"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727175547/http://www.nps.org.au/consumers/publications/medicines_talk/medicinestalk_no._32_summer_2009/time_to_think_about_vaccinations_again |date=27 July 2011 }}, ''Medicines Talk'', Sydney, 3 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public Health Law Research, an independent US based organization, reported in 2009 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of requiring vaccinations as a condition for specified jobs as a means of reducing incidence of specific diseases among particularly vulnerable populations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publichealthlawresearch.org/product/laws-and-policies-requiring-specified-vaccinations-among-high-risk-populations |title=Laws and Policies Requiring Specified Vaccinations among High Risk Populations |publisher=Public Health Law Research |date=7 December 2009 |access-date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is sufficient evidence supporting the effectiveness of requiring vaccinations as a condition for attending child care facilities and schools;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publichealthlawresearch.org/product/vaccination-requirements-child-care-school-and-college-attendance |title=Vaccination Requirements for Child Care, School and College Attendance |publisher=Public Health Law Research |date=12 July 2009 |access-date=19 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of standing orders, which allow healthcare workers without prescription authority to administer vaccine as a public health intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publichealthlawresearch.org/product/standing-orders-vaccination |title=Standing Orders for Vaccination |publisher=Public Health Law Research |date=12 July 2009 |access-date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fractional dose vaccination ===
[[Fractional dose vaccination]] reduces the dose of a vaccine to allow more individuals to be vaccinated with a given vaccine stock, trading societal benefit for individual protection.

=== Litigation ===
Allegations of vaccine injuries in recent decades have appeared in litigation in the U.S. Some families have won substantial awards from sympathetic juries, even though most [[public health]] officials have said that the claims of injuries were unfounded.&lt;ref name="Sugarman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sugarman SD | title = Cases in vaccine court—legal battles over vaccines and autism | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 13 | pages = 1275–7 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17898095 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp078168 | url = https://works.bepress.com/stephen_sugarman/77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, several vaccine makers stopped production, which the US government believed could be a threat to [[public health]], so laws were passed to shield manufacturers from [[Legal liability|liabilities]] stemming from vaccine injury claims.&lt;ref name="Sugarman" /&gt; The safety and side effects of multiple vaccines have been tested to uphold the viability of vaccines as a barrier against disease.

====Vaccination and autism====
{{Main|MMR vaccine and autism}}

The notion of a connection between vaccines and autism originated in a 1998 paper published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' whose lead author was the physician [[Andrew Wakefield]]. His study concluded that eight of the 12 patients (ages 3–10) developed behavioral symptoms consistent with autism following the [[MMR vaccine]] (an immunization against [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[rubella]]).&lt;ref name="Wakefield"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakefield AJ, Murch SH, Anthony A, Linnell J, Casson DM, Malik M, Berelowitz M, Dhillon AP, Thomson MA, Harvey P, Valentine A, Davies SE, Walker-Smith JA | s2cid = 439791 | title = Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children | journal = Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = 9103 | pages = 637–41 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9500320 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm | author-link1 = Andrew Wakefield }}{{Retracted|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was widely criticized for lack of scientific rigor and it was proven that Wakefield falsified data in the article.&lt;ref name="Wakefield" /&gt; In 2004, 10 of the original 12 co-authors (not including Wakefield) published a retraction of the article and stated the following: "We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH, Malik M, Berelowitz M, Dhillon AP, Thomson MA, Valentine A, Davies SE, Walker-Smith JA | s2cid = 5128036 | title = Retraction of an interpretation | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9411 | pages = 750 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15016483 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''The Lancet'' officially retracted the article stating that several elements of the article were incorrect, including falsified data and protocols. This ''Lancet'' article has sparked a much greater anti-vaccination movement, particularly in the United States. Even though the article was fraudulent and was retracted, 1 in 4 parents still believe vaccines can cause autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daley MF, Glanz JM | title = Straight talk about vaccination | journal = Scientific American | volume = 305 | issue = 3 | pages = 32–34 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21870438 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0911-32 | bibcode = 2011SciAm.305b..32D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, all validated and definitive studies have shown that there is no correlation between [[vaccines and autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html|title=Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism Concerns {{!}} Vaccine Safety {{!}} CDC|date=6 February 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the studies published in 2015 confirms there is no link between autism and the MMR vaccine. Infants were given a health plan, that included an MMR vaccine, and were continuously studied until they reached 5 years old. There was no link between the vaccine and children who had a normally developed sibling or a sibling that had autism making them a higher risk for developing autism themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain A, Marshall J, Buikema A, Bancroft T, Kelly JP, Newschaffer CJ | title = Autism occurrence by MMR vaccine status among US children with older siblings with and without autism | journal = JAMA | volume = 313 | issue = 15 | pages = 1534–40 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25898051 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2015.3077 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be difficult to correct the memory of humans when wrong information is received prior to correct information. Even though there is much evidence to go against the Wakefield study and most of the co-authors published retractions, many continue to believe and base decisions on it as it still lingers in their memory. Studies and research are being conducted to determine effective ways to correct misinformation in the [[public memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pluviano S, Watt C, Della Sala S | title = Misinformation lingers in memory: Failure of three pro-vaccination strategies | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = e0181640 | date = 27 July 2017 | pmid = 28749996 | pmc = 5547702 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0181640 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1281640P | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Wakefield study was released over 20 years ago, it may prove easier for newer generations to be properly educated on vaccinations. A very small percentage of people have adverse reactions to vaccines, and if there is a reaction it is often mild. These reactions do not include autism.

==Routes of administration==
{{see also|Vaccination schedule}}
A vaccine administration may be oral, by injection (intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous), by puncture, [[transdermal]] or intranasal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Plotkin SA | title = Mass Vaccination: Global Aspects – Progress and Obstacles (Current Topics in Microbiology &amp; Immunology) | publisher = Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co. K | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-3-540-29382-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent clinical trials have aimed to deliver the vaccines via mucosal surfaces to be up-taken by the [[Mucosal immunology|common mucosal immunity system]], thus avoiding the need for injections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujkuyama Y, Tokuhara D, Kataoka K, Gilbert RS, McGhee JR, Yuki Y, Kiyono H, Fujihashi K | title = Novel vaccine development strategies for inducing mucosal immunity | journal = Expert Review of Vaccines | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–79 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22380827 | pmc = 3315788 | doi = 10.1586/erv.11.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics of vaccination ==
Health is often used as one of the metrics for determining the economic prosperity of a country. This is because healthier individuals are generally better suited to contributing to the economic development of a country than the sick.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quilici S, Smith R, Signorelli C | title = Role of vaccination in economic growth | journal = Journal of Market Access &amp; Health Policy | volume = 3 | pages = 27044 | date = 12 August 2015 | pmid = 27123174 | pmc = 4802686 | doi = 10.3402/jmahp.v3.27044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many reasons for this. For instance, a person who is vaccinated for influenza not only protects themselves from the risk of [[influenza]], but simultaneously also prevents themselves from infecting those around them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|date=10 December 2003|title=Financing Vaccines in the 21st Century|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10782/chapter/2#10|doi=10.17226/10782|pmid=25057673|isbn=978-0-309-08979-1 |author1 =Institute of Medicine | author2 =Board on Health Care Services |author3 = Committee on the Evaluation of Vaccine Purchase Financing in the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a healthier society, which allows individuals to be more economically productive.

=== Costs and benefits ===

On the whole, vaccinations induce a net benefit to society. Vaccines are often noted for their high [[Return on investment]] (ROI) values, especially when considering the long-term effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll S, Rojas AJ, Glenngård AH, Marin C | title = Vaccination: short- to long-term benefits from investment | journal = Journal of Market Access &amp; Health Policy | volume = 3 | pages = 27279 | date = 12 August 2015 | pmid = 27123171 | pmc = 4802682 | doi = 10.3402/jmahp.v3.27279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vaccines have much higher ROI values than others. Studies have shown that the ratios of vaccination benefits to costs can differ substantially—from 27:1 for diphtheria/pertussis, to 13.5:1 for measles, 4.76:1 for varicella, and 0.68–1.1 : 1 for pneumococcal conjugate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some governments choose to subsidize the costs of vaccines, due to some of the high ROI values attributed to vaccinations. The United States subsidizes over half of all vaccines for children, which costs between $400 and $600 each. Although most children do get vaccinated, the adult population of the USA is still below the recommended immunization levels. Many factors can be attributed to this issue. Many adults who have other health conditions are unable to be safely immunized, whereas others opt not to be immunized for the sake of private financial benefits. Many Americans are underinsured, and, as such, are required to pay for vaccines out-of-pocket. Others are responsible for paying high deductibles and co-pays. Although vaccinations usually induce long-term economic benefits, many governments struggle to pay the high short-term costs associated with labor and production. Consequently, many countries neglect to provide such services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a 2021 paper, vaccinations against [[Haemophilus influenzae|haemophilus influenzae type b]], [[hepatitis B]], [[Human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]], [[Japanese encephalitis]], [[measles]], [[Neisseria meningitidis|neisseria meningitidis serogroup A]], [[rotavirus]], [[rubella]], [[streptococcus pneumoniae]], and [[yellow fever]] have prevented an estimated 50 million deaths from 2000 to 2019.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Toor|first1=Jaspreet|last2=Echeverria-Londono|first2=Susy|last3=Li|first3=Xiang|last4=Abbas|first4=Kaja|last5=Carter|first5=Emily D|last6=Clapham|first6=Hannah E|last7=Clark|first7=Andrew|last8=de Villiers|first8=Margaret J|last9=Eilertson|first9=Kirsten|last10=Ferrari|first10=Matthew|last11=Gamkrelidze|first11=Ivane|date=2021-07-13|editor-last=Stanley|editor-first=Margaret|editor2-last=Harper|editor2-first=Diane M|editor3-last=Soldan|editor3-first=Kate|title=Lives saved with vaccination for 10 pathogens across 112 countries in a pre-COVID-19 world|url=https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67635|journal=[[eLife]]|volume=10|pages=e67635|doi=10.7554/eLife.67635|pmid=34253291 |pmc=8277373 |issn=2050-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper "represents the largest assessment of vaccine impact before COVID-19-related disruptions".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to a June 2022 study, [[COVID-19 vaccine|COVID{{nbhyph}}19 vaccinations]] prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Watson OJ, Barnsley G, Toor J, Hogan AB, Winskill P, Ghani AC |date=June 2022 |title=Global impact of the first year of COVID-19 vaccination: a mathematical modelling study |journal=[[The Lancet Infectious Diseases]] |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1293–1302 |doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00320-6 |pmc=9225255 |pmid=35753318 |doi-access=free |title-link=doi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=24 June 2022 |title=COVID-19 vaccines saved nearly 20 million lives in a year, study says |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-saved-nearly-20-million-lives-in-a-year-study-says/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220629025146/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-saved-nearly-20-million-lives-in-a-year-study-says/ |archive-date=29 June 2022 |access-date=27 June 2022 |website=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]] published a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2018 which estimated the costs of developing vaccines for diseases that could escalate into global humanitarian crises.  They focused on 11 diseases which cause relatively few deaths at present and primarily strike the poor which have been highlighted as pandemic risks:
*[[Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever]]
*[[Chikungunya]]
*[[Ebola]]
*[[Lassa fever]]
*[[Marburg virus disease]]
*[[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus]]
*[[Nipah virus infection]]
*[[Rift Valley fever]]
*[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome]]
*[[Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome]]
*[[Zika]]

They estimated that it would cost between $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion and $3.7&amp;nbsp;billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak. The 2003 SARS outbreak in East Asia cost $54&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists have estimated the cost of stopping 11 diseases that could kill millions in a pandemic |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17999676/vaccine-ebola-pandemic-disease-zika-epidemic-sars |access-date=2 December 2018 |publisher=Vox |date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Game theory]] uses [[Utility|utility functions]] to model costs and benefits, which may include financial and non-financial costs and benefits.  In recent years, it has been argued that game theory can effectively be used to model vaccine uptake in societies. Researchers have used game theory for this purpose to analyse vaccination uptake in the context of diseases such as influenza and measles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang SL, Piraveenan M, Pattison P, Prokopenko M | title = Game theoretic modelling of infectious disease dynamics and intervention methods: a review | journal = Journal of Biological Dynamics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–89 | date = December 2020 | pmid = 31996099 | doi = 10.1080/17513758.2020.1720322 | s2cid = 58004680 | arxiv = 1901.04143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Game theoretic analysis can be especially beneficial when a large and complex range of factors and parameters need to be taken into account by individuals in making vaccination decisions, and several options for vaccination are available, such as in the context of COVID-19 vaccination. Piraveenan et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piraveenan M, Sawleshwarkar S, Walsh M, Zablotska I, Bhattacharyya S, Farooqui HH, Bhatnagar T, Karan A, Murhekar M, Zodpey S, Rao KS, Pattison P, Zomaya A, Perc M | display-authors = 6 | title = Optimal governance and implementation of vaccination programmes to contain the COVID-19 pandemic | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 210429 | date = June 2021 | pmid = 34113457 | pmc = 8188005 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.210429 | arxiv = 2011.06455 | bibcode = 2021RSOS....810429P }}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that game theory, particularly when used in conjunction with models of bounded rationality of people, can be an effective tool in modelling and predicting COVID-19 vaccination uptake, which can in turn guide government policy.

The [[Sympathetic nervous system]] and [[Parasympathetic nervous system]] can offset each other. One of the most classical example is called '''Vagal Escape'''. Vagal escape is characterized by a reduction in [[blood pressure]] due to [[muscarinic]] stimulation which is then compensated for stimulation from the sympathetic system to increase heart rate and thus blood pressure.
When the heart is continuously stimulated via the vagus nerve, initially there is stoppage of heart beat. With further continuous stimuli, heart beat resumes (namely the ventricles) as the parasympathetic nerves only have their influence on the [[Sinoatrial node|SA]] and [[Atrioventricular node|AV]] nodes of the heart and not on the musculature of the heart, which establishes its own rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guyton|first1=Arthur C.|title= Textbook of Medical Physiology|publisher=Saunders Book Company|date=1 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vagrancy''' is a phenomenon in [[biology]] whereby an individual animal (usually a [[bird]]) appears well outside its normal [[range (biology)|range]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=C.

The term '''accidental''' is sometimes also used. There are a number of poorly understood factors which might cause an animal to become a vagrant, including internal causes such as navigatory errors (endogenous vagrancy)  and external causes such as severe weather (exogenous vagrancy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/vagrancy-in-birds-9781472964793/|title = Vagrancy in Birds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vagrancy events may lead to colonisation and eventually to speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lees|first1=Alexander C.|last2=Gilroy|first2=James J. |date=2013-11-12|title= Vagrancy fails to predict colonization of oceanic islands |journal= Global Ecology and Biogeography |language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=405–413|doi=10.1111/geb.12129 |issn= 1466-8238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birds ==
{{See also|Bird migration#Vagrancy}}
[[File:Great Shearwater specimen (as discovered), Sleeping Bear Dunes NL, September 9, 2012 (7969969606).jpg|thumb|Vagrant birds in unfamiliar habitats may end up dying from stress or a lack of food, as happened to this [[great shearwater]] that was found at [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] on [[Lake Michigan]]]]
In the Northern Hemisphere, adult birds (possibly inexperienced younger adults) of many species are known to continue past their normal breeding range during their spring migration and end up in areas further north (such birds are termed '''spring overshoots''').

In autumn, some young birds, instead of heading to their usual wintering grounds, take "incorrect" courses and migrate through areas which are not on their normal migration path. For example, Siberian [[passerine]]s which normally winter in [[Southeast Asia]] are commonly found in [[Northwest Europe]], e.g. [[Arctic warbler]]s in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thorup|first=Kasper|date=May 1998|title=Vagrancy of Yellow‐browed Warbler Phylloscopus inornatus and Pallas's Warbler Ph. proregulus in north‐west Europe: Misorientation on great circles?|journal=Ringing &amp; Migration|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=7–12|doi=10.1080/03078698.1998.9674155|issn=0307-8698|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is [[Reverse migration (birds)|reverse migration]], where the birds migrate in the opposite direction to that expected (say, flying north-west instead of south-east). The causes of this are unknown, but genetic mutation or other anomalies relating to the bird's magnetic sensibilities is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Other birds are sent off course by storms, such as some North American birds blown across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Birds can also be blown out to sea, become physically exhausted, land on a ship and end up being carried to the ship's destination.

While many vagrant birds do not survive, if sufficient numbers wander to a new area they can establish new populations. Many isolated oceanic islands are home to species that are descended from landbirds blown out to sea, [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s and [[Darwin's finches]] being prominent examples.

== Insects ==
Vagrancy in insects is recorded from many groups—it is particularly well-studied in [[butterflies]] and [[moths]], and [[dragonflies]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== Mammals ==
In mammals, vagrancy has been recorded for bats, pinniped seals, whales, manatees, belugas, cougars, and more.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== Reptiles ==
Vagrancy has been recorded for [[sea turtle]]s, snakes (e.g. ''[[Pelamis platura]]''), crocodilians, and probably also occurs in lizards. It therefore seems to be a fairly widespread phenomenon in reptiles. Saltwater crocodiles are especially prone to vagrancy, with individuals occasionally being recorded in odd places including [[Fiji]], [[Iwo Jima]], and even the [[Sea of Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== Plants ==
The term vagrant is also used of plants (e.g. Gleason and Cronquist, 1991), to refer to a plant that is growing far away from its species' usual range (especially north of its range) with the connotation of being a temporary population. In the context of lichens, a vagrant form or species occurs unattached to a substrate ("loose"), not necessarily outside its range.&lt;ref&gt;Rosentreter, R. &amp; McCune, B. 1992. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3243779 "Vagrant ''Dermatocarpon'' in Western North America"]. ''The Bryologist''. 95:15–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition (de Lange &amp; Molloy, 1995) defined vagrant species in New Zealand flora - although could also be applied for any given region. Their definition was, "taxa whose presence within the New Zealand botanical region is naturally transitory... those which have failed to establish themselves significantly beyond their point of introduction through reproductive failure or for quite specific ecological reasons.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Lange |first1=P. J. |last2=Molloy |first2=B. P. J. |title=Vagrancy within New Zealand orchids: what are the conservation priorities? |journal=New Zealand Botanical Society Newsletter |date=1995 |volume=40 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example was the presence of ''[[Atriplex cinerea]]'' in New Zealand.

[[Gene therapy]] utilizes the delivery of DNA into cells, which can be accomplished by several methods, summarized below. The two major classes of methods are those that use recombinant viruses (sometimes called biological nanoparticles or viral vectors) and those that use naked DNA or DNA complexes (non-viral methods).

==Viruses==
{{Main|Viral vector}}
All [[virus]]es bind to their hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as part of their replication cycle. This genetic material contains basic 'instructions' of how to produce more copies of these viruses, hacking the body's normal production machinery to serve the needs of the virus. The host cell will carry out these instructions and produce additional copies of the virus, leading to more and more cells becoming infected. Some types of viruses insert their genome into the host's cytoplasm, but do not actually enter the cell. Others penetrate the cell membrane disguised as protein molecules and enter the cell.

There are two main types of virus infection: [[lytic cycle|lytic]] and [[lysogenic cycle|lysogenic]]. Shortly after inserting its DNA, viruses of the lytic cycle quickly produce more viruses, burst from the cell and infect more cells. Lysogenic viruses integrate their DNA into the DNA of the host cell and may live in the body for many years before responding to a trigger. The virus reproduces as the cell does and does not inflict bodily harm until it is triggered. The trigger releases the DNA from that of the host and employs it to create new viruses.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Retroviruses===
The genetic material in [[retrovirus]]es is in the form of [[RNA]] molecules, while the genetic material of their hosts is in the form of DNA. When a retrovirus infects a host cell, it will introduce its RNA together with some enzymes, namely reverse transcriptase and [[integrase]], into the cell. This RNA molecule from the retrovirus must produce a DNA copy from its RNA molecule before it can be integrated into the genetic material of the host cell. The process of producing a DNA copy from an RNA molecule is termed [[reverse transcription]]. It is carried out by one of the enzymes carried in the virus, called [[reverse transcriptase]]. After this DNA copy is produced and is free in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the host cell, it must be incorporated into the genome of the host cell. That is, it must be inserted into the large DNA molecules in the cell (the chromosomes). This process is done by another enzyme carried in the virus called [[integrase]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Now that the genetic material of the virus has been inserted, it can be said that the host cell has been modified to contain new genes. If this host cell divides later, its descendants will all contain the new genes. Sometimes the genes of the retrovirus do not express their information immediately.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

One of the problems of gene therapy using retroviruses is that the integrase enzyme can insert the genetic material of the virus into any arbitrary position in the genome of the host; it randomly inserts the genetic material into a chromosome. If genetic material happens to be inserted in the middle of one of the original genes of the host cell, this gene will be disrupted ([[insertional mutagenesis]]). If the gene happens to be one regulating cell division, uncontrolled cell division (i.e., [[cancer]]) can occur. This problem has recently begun to be addressed by utilizing [[zinc finger nucleases]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durai S, Mani M, Kandavelou K, Wu J, Porteus MH, Chandrasegaran S | title = Zinc finger nucleases: custom-designed molecular scissors for genome engineering of plant and mammalian cells | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = 18 | pages = 5978–90 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16251401 | pmc = 1270952 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gki912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by including certain sequences such as the [[beta-globin locus control region]] to direct the site of integration to specific chromosomal sites.

Gene therapy trials using retroviral vectors to treat X-linked [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (X-SCID) represent the most successful application of gene therapy to date. More than twenty patients have been treated in France and Britain, with a high rate of immune system reconstitution observed. Similar trials were restricted or halted in the US when [[leukemia]] was reported in patients treated in the French X-SCID gene therapy trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hacein-Bey-Abina|first=S|date=July 2010|title=Efficacy of gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=363|issue=4|pages=355–364|via=Pub Med|pmc=2957288|pmid=20660403|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1000164}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, four children in the French trial and one in the British trial have developed leukemia as a result of insertional mutagenesis by the retroviral vector. All but one of these children responded well to conventional anti-leukemia treatment. Gene therapy trials to treat SCID due to deficiency of the Adenosine Deaminase ([[Adenosine deaminase|ADA]]) enzyme (one form of SCID)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About SCID – Missing Body Defense Systems| url = http://www.scid.net/the-scid-homepage/about-scid/ | work = Severe Immune Deficiency Site }}&lt;/ref&gt; continue with relative success in the US, Britain, Ireland, Italy and Japan.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Adenoviruses===
[[Adenovirus]]es are viruses that carry their genetic material in the form of double-stranded DNA. They cause respiratory, intestinal, and eye infections in humans (especially the common cold). When these viruses infect a host cell, they introduce their DNA molecule into the host. The genetic material of the adenoviruses is not incorporated (transient) into the host cell's genetic material. The DNA molecule is left free in the nucleus of the host cell, and the instructions in this extra DNA molecule are [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] just like any other gene. The only difference is that these extra genes are not replicated when the cell is about to undergo cell division so the descendants of that cell will not have the extra gene.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

As a result, treatment with the adenovirus will require readministration in a growing cell population although the absence of integration into the host cell's genome should prevent the type of cancer seen in the SCID trials. This vector system has been promoted for treating cancer and indeed the first gene therapy product to be licensed to treat cancer, [[Gendicine]], is an adenovirus.  Gendicine, an adenoviral [[p53|p53-based]] gene therapy was approved by the Chinese food and drug regulators in 2003 for treatment of head and neck cancer. Advexin, a similar gene therapy approach from Introgen, was turned down by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2008.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Concerns about the safety of adenovirus vectors were raised after the 1999 death of [[Jesse Gelsinger]] while participating in a gene therapy trial. Since then, work using adenovirus vectors has focused on genetically limited versions of the virus.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Cytomegalovirus===

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is part of the β-herpesvirus subfamily that includes roseoloviruses. CMV coevolved with an assortment of mammalian hosts, including human CMV (HCMV), murine CMV (MCMV) and rhesus CMV (RhCMV). CMVs are characterized by large DNA genomes and typically asymptomatic infection in healthy hosts.

The first investigation into cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a gene therapy vector was published in 2000. CMV's tropism for hematopoietic progenitor cells and its large genome (230 kbp) initially attracted researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borst, E., and M. Messerle |title=Development of a cytomegalovirus vector for somatic gene therapy |journal=Bone Marrow Transplantation |date=2000 |volume=25 |issue=2|pages=S80-2 |doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1702361 |pmid=10933196 |s2cid=19751534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CMV-based vaccine vectors have since been used to induce T Cell response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Früh, Klaus, and Louis Picker |title=CD8+ T cell programming by cytomegalovirus vectors: applications in prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination |journal=Current Opinion in Immunology |date=2017 |volume=47|pages=52–56 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2017.06.010 |pmid=28734175 |pmc=5626601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, CMV containing telomerase and follistatin was intravenously and intranasally delivered in mouse studies with the intention of extending healthspan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jaijyan |first1=Dabbu |title=New intranasal and injectable gene therapy for healthy life extension |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2022 |volume=119 |issue=20 |pages=e2121499119 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2121499119 |pmid=35537048 |pmc=9171804 |bibcode=2022PNAS..11921499J |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Envelope protein pseudotyping of viral vectors===
The viral vectors described above have natural host cell populations that they infect most efficiently. [[Retroviruses]] have limited natural host cell ranges, and although [[adenovirus]] and [[adeno-associated virus]] are able to infect a relatively broader range of cells efficiently, some cell types are resistant to infection by these viruses as well. Attachment to and entry into a susceptible cell is mediated by the protein envelope on the surface of a virus. Retroviruses and adeno-associated viruses have a single protein coating their membrane, while adenoviruses are coated with both an envelope protein and fibers that extend away from the surface of the virus. The [[envelope proteins]] on each of these viruses bind to [[cell-surface molecules]] such as [[heparin sulfate]], which localizes them upon the surface of the potential host, as well as with the specific [[protein receptor]] that either induces entry-promoting structural changes in the viral protein, or localizes the virus in [[endosomes]] wherein acidification of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] induces this refolding of the [[viral coat]]. In either case, entry into potential host cells requires a favorable interaction between a protein on the surface of the virus and a protein on the surface of the cell.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For the purposes of gene therapy, one might either want to limit or expand the range of cells susceptible to transduction by a gene therapy vector. To this end, many vectors have been developed in which the endogenous viral envelope proteins have been replaced by either envelope proteins from other viruses, or by chimeric proteins. Such [[Chimera (virus)|chimera]] would consist of those parts of the viral protein necessary for incorporation into the virion as well as sequences meant to interact with specific host cell proteins. Viruses in which the envelope proteins have been replaced as described are referred to as [[pseudotyped viruses]]. For example, the most popular retroviral vector for use in gene therapy trials has been the [[lentivirus]] [[Simian immunodeficiency virus]] coated with the envelope proteins, [[G-protein]], from [[Vesicular stomatitis virus]]. This vector is referred to as [[VSV G-pseudotyped lentivirus]], and infects an almost universal set of cells. This tropism is characteristic of the VSV G-protein with which this vector is coated. Many attempts have been made to limit the tropism of viral vectors to one or a few host cell populations. This advance would allow for the systemic administration of a relatively small amount of vector. The potential for off-target cell modification would be limited, and many concerns from the medical community would be alleviated. Most attempts to limit tropism have used chimeric envelope proteins bearing [[antibody]] fragments. These vectors show great promise for the development of "magic bullet" gene therapies.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Replication-competent vectors===
A replication-competent vector called ONYX-015 is used in replicating tumor cells. It was found that in the absence of the E1B-55Kd viral protein, adenovirus caused very rapid apoptosis of infected, p53(+) cells, and this results in dramatically reduced virus progeny and no subsequent spread. Apoptosis was mainly the result of the ability of EIA to inactivate p300. In p53(-) cells, deletion of E1B 55kd has no consequence in terms of apoptosis, and viral replication is similar to that of wild-type virus, resulting in massive killing of cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A replication-defective vector deletes some essential genes. These deleted genes are still necessary in the body so they are replaced with either a helper virus or a DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;"The Process of Gene Therapy." Alternate Heals. 8 may 2006. Alternate Medicine, Web. 23 November 2009.{{MEDRS|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cis and trans-acting elements===
Replication-defective vectors always contain a "transfer construct". The transfer construct carries the gene to be transduced or "transgene". The transfer construct also carries the sequences which are necessary for the general functioning of the viral genome: packaging sequence, repeats for replication and, when needed, priming of reverse transcription. These are denominated cis-acting elements, because they need to be on the same piece of DNA as the viral genome and the gene of interest. Trans-acting elements are viral elements, which can be encoded on a different DNA molecule. For example, the viral structural proteins can be expressed from a different genetic element than the viral genome.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;

===Herpes simplex virus===
The [[herpes simplex virus]] is a human neurotropic virus.  This is mostly examined for gene transfer in the nervous system.  The wild type HSV-1 virus is able to infect neurons and evade the host immune response, but may still become reactivated and produce a lytic cycle of viral replication.  Therefore, it is typical to use mutant strains of HSV-1 that are deficient in their ability to replicate.  Though the latent virus is not transcriptionally apparent, it does possess neuron specific promoters that can continue to function normally.{{elucidate|date=December 2010}} Antibodies to HSV-1 are common in humans, however complications due to herpes infection are somewhat rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harwood | first = Adrian J. | name-list-style = vanc | title = Protocols for Gene Analysis. 1st. 31. | volume = 31 | location = Totowa, New Jersey | publisher = Humana Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-89603-258-3 | doi = 10.1385/0896032582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caution for rare cases of encephalitis must be taken and this provides some rationale to using HSV-2 as a viral vector as it generally has tropism for neuronal cells innervating the urogenital area of the body and could then spare the host of severe pathology in the brain.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Non-viral methods==
Non-viral methods present certain advantages over viral methods, with simple large scale production and low host immunogenicity being just two. Previously, low levels of [[transfection]] and [[gene expression|expression of the gene]] held non-viral methods at a disadvantage; however, recent advances in vector technology have yielded molecules and techniques with transfection efficiencies similar to those of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murakami T, Sunada Y | title = Plasmid DNA gene therapy by electroporation: principles and recent advances | journal = Current Gene Therapy | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 447–56 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22023474 | doi = 10.2174/156652311798192860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Injection of naked DNA===
This is the simplest method of non-viral transfection. Clinical trials carried out of intramuscular injection of a [[naked DNA]] plasmid have occurred with some success; however, the expression has been very low in comparison to other methods of transfection. In addition to trials with plasmids, there have been trials with naked [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] product, which have had similar or greater success. Cellular uptake of naked DNA is generally inefficient. Research efforts focusing on improving the efficiency of naked DNA uptake have yielded several novel methods, such as [[electroporation]], [[sonoporation]], and the use of a "[[gene gun]]", which shoots DNA coated gold particles into the cell using high pressure gas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/16368929/Genes-and-DNA-A-Beginners-Guide-to-Genetics-and-Its-Applications{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical methods to enhance delivery===

====Electroporation====
[[Electroporation]] is a method that uses short pulses of high voltage to carry DNA across the cell membrane. This shock is thought to cause temporary formation of pores in the cell membrane, allowing DNA molecules to pass through. Electroporation is generally efficient and works across a broad range of cell types. However, a high rate of cell death following electroporation has limited its use, including clinical applications.

More recently a newer method of electroporation, termed electron-avalanche transfection, has been used in gene therapy experiments. By using a high-voltage plasma discharge, DNA was efficiently delivered following very short (microsecond) pulses. Compared to electroporation, the technique resulted in greatly increased efficiency and less cellular damage.

====Gene gun====
The use of particle bombardment, or the [[gene gun]], is another physical method of DNA transfection. In this technique, DNA is coated onto gold particles and loaded into a device which generates a force to achieve penetration of the DNA into the cells, leaving the gold behind on a "stopping" disk.

====Sonoporation====
[[Sonoporation]] uses ultrasonic frequencies to deliver DNA into cells. The process of acoustic cavitation is thought to disrupt the cell membrane and allow DNA to move into cells.

====Magnetofection====
In a method termed [[magnetofection]], DNA is complexed to magnetic particles, and a magnet is placed underneath the tissue culture dish to bring DNA complexes into contact with a cell monolayer.

====Hydrodynamic delivery====
[[Hydrodynamic delivery]] involves rapid injection of a high volume of a solution into vasculature (such as into the [[inferior vena cava]], [[bile duct]], or [[tail vein]]). The solution contains molecules that are to be inserted into cells, such as [[Plasmid|DNA plasmids]] or [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]], and transfer of these molecules into cells is assisted by the elevated hydrostatic pressure caused by the high volume of injected solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonamassa B, Hai L, Liu D | title = Hydrodynamic gene delivery and its applications in pharmaceutical research | journal = Pharmaceutical Research | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 694–701 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21191634 | pmc = 3064722 | doi = 10.1007/s11095-010-0338-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suda T, Liu D | title = Hydrodynamic gene delivery: its principles and applications | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 2063–9 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17912237 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mt.6300314 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2660(05)54004-5 |pmid=16096008 |chapter=Hydrodynamic Delivery |title=Non-Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy |edition=Second Edition: Part 2 |volume=54 |pages=65–82 |series=Advances in Genetics |year=2005 |last1=Al-Dosari |first1=Mohammed S |last2=Knapp |first2=Joseph E |last3=Liu |first3=Dexi |name-list-style=vanc |isbn=978-0-12-017654-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/nonviralvectorsf0000unse/page/65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical methods to enhance delivery===

====Oligonucleotides====
The use of synthetic oligonucleotides in gene therapy is to deactivate the genes involved in the disease process. There are several methods by which this is achieved. One strategy uses [[antisense]] specific to the target gene to disrupt the transcription of the faulty gene. Another uses small molecules of RNA called [[siRNA]] to signal the cell to cleave specific unique sequences in the [[mRNA]] transcript of the faulty gene, disrupting translation of the faulty mRNA, and therefore expression of the gene. A further strategy uses double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides as a decoy for the transcription factors that are required to activate the transcription of the target gene. The transcription factors bind to the decoys instead of the promoter of the faulty gene, which reduces the transcription of the target gene, lowering expression. Additionally, single stranded DNA oligonucleotides have been used to direct a single base change within a mutant gene. The oligonucleotide is designed to anneal with complementarity to the target gene with the exception of a central base, the target base, which serves as the template base for repair. This technique is referred to as oligonucleotide mediated gene repair, targeted gene repair, or targeted nucleotide alteration.

====Lipoplexes====
{{Wiktionary|lipoplex}}
To improve the delivery of the new DNA into the cell, the DNA must be protected from damage and positively charged. Initially, anionic and neutral lipids were used for the construction of lipoplexes for synthetic vectors. However, in spite of the facts that there is little toxicity associated with them, that they are compatible with body fluids and that there was a possibility of adapting them to be tissue specific; they are complicated and time-consuming to produce so attention was turned to the cationic versions.

[[Cationic liposome|Cationic lipids]], due to their positive charge, were first used to condense negatively charged DNA molecules so as to facilitate the encapsulation of DNA into liposomes. Later it was found that the use of cationic lipids significantly enhanced the stability of lipoplexes. Also as a result of their charge, cationic liposomes interact with the cell membrane, [[endocytosis]] was widely believed as the major route by which cells uptake lipoplexes. Endosomes are formed as the results of endocytosis, however, if genes can not be released into cytoplasm by breaking the membrane of endosome, they will be sent to lysosomes where all DNA will be destroyed before they could achieve their functions. It was also found that although cationic lipids themselves could condense and encapsulate DNA into liposomes, the transfection efficiency is very low due to the lack of ability in terms of "endosomal escaping". However, when helper lipids (usually electroneutral lipids, such as DOPE) were added to form lipoplexes, much higher transfection efficiency was observed. Later on, it was discovered that certain lipids have the ability to destabilize endosomal membranes so as to facilitate the escape of DNA from endosome, therefore those lipids are called fusogenic lipids. Although cationic liposomes have been widely used as an alternative for gene delivery vectors, a dose dependent toxicity of cationic lipids were also observed which could limit their therapeutic usages.&lt;ref name="Cite Q|Q38565053"&gt;{{Cite Q|Q38565053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common use of lipoplexes has been in gene transfer into cancer cells, where the supplied genes have activated tumor suppressor control genes in the cell and decrease the activity of oncogenes. Recent studies have shown lipoplexes to be useful in transfecting respiratory [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]].

====Polymersomes====
[[Polymersome]]s are synthetic versions of [[liposomes]] ([[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] with a [[lipid bilayer]]), made of [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] [[Copolymer#Block copolymers|block copolymers]]. They can encapsulate either [[Hydrophile#Hydrophilic molecules|hydrophilic]] or [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] contents and can be used to deliver cargo such as DNA, proteins, or drugs to cells. Advantages of polymersomes over liposomes include greater stability, mechanical strength, blood circulation time, and storage capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krishnamoorthy B, Karanam V, Chellan VR, Siram K, Natarajan TS, Gregory M | title = Polymersomes as an effective drug delivery system for glioma--a review | journal = Journal of Drug Targeting | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 469–77 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24830300 | doi = 10.3109/1061186X.2014.916712 | s2cid = 35338595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrawati R, Caruso F | title = Biomimetic liposome- and polymersome-based multicompartmentalized assemblies | journal = Langmuir | volume = 28 | issue = 39 | pages = 13798–807 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22831559 | doi = 10.1021/la301958v | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yin H, Kanasty RL, Eltoukhy AA, Vegas AJ, Dorkin JR, Anderson DG | title = Non-viral vectors for gene-based therapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

====Polyplexes====
{{Wiktionary|polyplex}}
Complexes of polymers with DNA are called polyplexes.&lt;ref name="Cite Q|Q38565053"/&gt; Most polyplexes consist of cationic polymers and their fabrication is based on self-assembly by ionic interactions. One important difference between the methods of action of polyplexes and lipoplexes is that polyplexes cannot directly release their DNA load into the cytoplasm. As a result, co-transfection with endosome-lytic agents such as inactivated adenovirus was required to facilitate nanoparticle escape from the endocytic vesicle made during particle uptake. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which DNA can escape from endolysosomal pathway, i.e. proton sponge effect,&lt;ref name=pmid15543529&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akinc A, Thomas M, Klibanov AM, Langer R | title = Exploring polyethylenimine-mediated DNA transfection and the proton sponge hypothesis | journal = The Journal of Gene Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 657–63 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15543529 | doi = 10.1002/jgm.696 | s2cid = 25740208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has triggered new polymer synthesis strategies such as incorporation of protonable residues in polymer backbone and has revitalized research on polycation-based systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tiera MJ, Shi Q, Winnik FM, Fernandes JC | title = Polycation-based gene therapy: current knowledge and new perspectives | journal = Current Gene Therapy | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 288–306 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21453278 | doi = 10.2174/156652311796150408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their low toxicity, high loading capacity, and ease of fabrication, polycationic nanocarriers demonstrate great promise compared to their rivals such as viral vectors which show high immunogenicity and potential carcinogenicity, and lipid-based vectors which cause dose dependence toxicity. [[Polyethyleneimine]]&lt;ref name=pmid22432843&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nimesh S | title = Polyethylenimine as a promising vector for targeted siRNA delivery | journal = Current Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–30 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22432843 | doi = 10.2174/157488412800228857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chitosan]] are among the polymeric carriers that have been extensively studied for development of gene delivery therapeutics. Other polycationic carriers such as poly(beta-amino esters)&lt;ref name=pmid23646347&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kozielski KL, Tzeng SY, Green JJ | title = A bioreducible linear poly(β-amino ester) for siRNA delivery | journal = Chemical Communications | volume = 49 | issue = 46 | pages = 5319–21 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23646347 | pmc = 3894248 | doi = 10.1039/c3cc40718g }}&lt;/ref&gt; and polyphosphoramidate&lt;ref name=pmid23055399&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang X, Qu W, Pan D, Ren Y, Williford JM, Cui H, Luijten E, Mao HQ | title = Plasmid-templated shape control of condensed DNA-block copolymer nanoparticles | journal = Advanced Materials | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–32 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23055399 | pmc = 3918481 | doi = 10.1002/adma.201202932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are being added to the library of potential gene carriers. In addition to the variety of polymers and copolymers, the ease of controlling the size, shape, surface chemistry of these polymeric nano-carriers gives them an edge in targeting capability and taking advantage of enhanced permeability and retention effect.&lt;ref name="matsamura"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumura Y, Maeda H | title = A new concept for macromolecular therapeutics in cancer chemotherapy: mechanism of tumoritropic accumulation of proteins and the antitumor agent smancs | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 46 | issue = 12 Pt 1 | pages = 6387–92 | date = December 1986 | pmid = 2946403 | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=2946403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dendrimers====
A [[dendrimer]] is a highly branched [[macromolecule]] with a spherical shape. The surface of the particle may be functionalized in many ways and many of the properties of the resulting construct are determined by its surface.

In particular it is possible to construct a cationic dendrimer, i.e. one with a positive surface charge. When in the presence of genetic material such as DNA or RNA, charge complementarity leads to a temporary association of the nucleic acid with the cationic dendrimer. On reaching its destination the dendrimer-nucleic acid complex is then taken into the cell via endocytosis.

In recent years the benchmark for transfection agents has been cationic lipids. Limitations of these competing reagents have been reported to include: the lack of ability to transfect some cell types, the lack of robust active targeting capabilities, incompatibility with animal models, and toxicity. Dendrimers offer robust covalent construction and extreme control over molecule structure, and therefore size. Together these give compelling advantages compared to existing approaches.

Producing dendrimers has historically been a slow and expensive process consisting of numerous slow reactions, an obstacle that severely curtailed their commercial development. The Michigan-based company Dendritic Nanotechnologies discovered a method to produce dendrimers using kinetically driven chemistry, a process that not only reduced cost by a magnitude of three, but also cut reaction time from over a month to several days. These new "Priostar" dendrimers can be specifically constructed to carry a DNA or RNA payload that transfects cells at a high efficiency with little or no toxicity.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

====Inorganic nanoparticles====
Inorganic nanoparticles, such as [[gold]], [[silica]], iron oxide (ex. [[magnetofection]]) and [[calcium phosphates]] have been shown to be capable of gene delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner DE, Bhaduri SB | title = Progress and outlook of inorganic nanoparticles for delivery of nucleic acid sequences related to orthopedic pathologies: a review | journal = Tissue Engineering Part B: Reviews | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 21707439 | doi = 10.1089/ten.TEB.2011.0081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the benefits of inorganic vectors is in their storage stability, low manufacturing cost and often time, low immunogenicity, and resistance to microbial attack. Nanosized materials less than 100&amp;nbsp;nm have been shown to efficiently trap the [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] and allows its escape from the [[endosome]] without degradation. Inorganics have also been shown to exhibit improved in vitro [[transfection]] for attached cell lines due to their increased density and preferential location on the base of the culture dish. [[Quantum dots]] have also been used successfully and permits the coupling of gene therapy with a stable fluorescence marker. Engineered organic nanoparticles are also under development, which could be used for co-delivery of genes and therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh BN, Gupta VK, Chen J, Atanasov AG | title = Organic Nanoparticle-Based Combinatory Approaches for Gene Therapy | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 35 | issue = 12 | pages = 1121–1124 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28818304 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.07.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cell-penetrating peptides====
[[Cell-penetrating peptides]] (CPPs), also known as peptide transduction domains (PTDs), are short [[peptides]] (&lt; 40 amino acids) that efficiently pass through cell membranes while being covalently or non-covalently bound to various molecules, thus facilitating these molecules' entry into cells. Cell entry occurs primarily by [[endocytosis]] but other entry mechanisms also exist. Examples of cargo molecules of CPPs include [[nucleic acids]], [[liposomes]], and drugs of low molecular weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Copolovici DM, Langel K, Eriste E, Langel Ü | title = Cell-penetrating peptides: design, synthesis, and applications | journal = ACS Nano | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 1972–94 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24559246 | doi = 10.1021/nn4057269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palm-Apergi C, Lönn P, Dowdy SF | title = Do cell-penetrating peptides actually "penetrate" cellular membranes? | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 695–7 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22472979 | pmc = 3322330 | doi = 10.1038/mt.2012.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPP cargo can be directed into specific cell organelles by incorporating [[Signal peptide|localization sequences]] into CPP sequences.

==Hybrid methods==
Due to every method of [[gene transfer]] having shortcomings, there have been some hybrid methods developed that combine two or more techniques. [[Virosomes]] are one example; they combine [[liposomes]] with an inactivated [[HIV]] or [[influenza virus]]. This has been shown to have more efficient gene transfer in respiratory [[epithelial cells]] than either viral or liposomal methods alone. Other methods involve mixing other viral vectors with [[cationic lipids]] or [[hybridising viruses]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

{{short description|Term indicating occurrence in the evening}}
{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Ipomoea alba 1DS-II 1-7726.jpg|thumb|''[[Ipomoea alba]]'' is a vespertine plant in the morning glory family, [[Convolvulaceae]]. Like many night-blooming plants, it is moth pollinated.]]
[[File:Bat at dusk.jpg|thumb|A bat flying at dusk]]

'''Vespertine''' is a term used in the [[biology|life sciences]] to indicate something of, relating to, or occurring in the evening. In [[botany]], a vespertine [[flower]] is one that opens or blooms in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plant Systematics |first=Michael G. |last=Simpson |page=577 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |date=9 August 2011 |isbn=9780080514048 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[zoology]], the term is used for a creature that becomes active at [[dusk]], such as bats and owls. Strictly speaking, however, the term means that activity ceases during the hours of full darkness and does not resume until the next evening. Activity that continues throughout the night should be described as [[nocturnal]]. 

Vespertine behaviour is a special case of [[crepuscular]] behaviour; like crepuscular activity, vespertine activity is limited to dusk rather than full darkness. Unlike vespertine activity, crepuscular activity may resume in dim [[twilight]] before dawn. A related term is [[matutinal]], referring to activity limited to the dawn twilight.

The word ''vespertine'' is derived from the Latin word ''{{wikt-lang|la|vespertīnus}}'', meaning "evening".

      <text bytes="31958" xml:space="preserve">The '''vibration theory''' of [[olfaction|smell]] proposes that a molecule's smell character is due to its [[vibrational spectroscopy|vibrational frequency]] in the infrared range. This controversial theory is an alternative to the more widely accepted [[docking theory of olfaction]] (formerly termed the shape theory of olfaction), which proposes that a molecule's smell character is due to a range of weak [[non-covalent interactions]] between its [[protein]] [[odorant receptor]] (found in the [[Human nose|nasal]] [[epithelium]]), such as [[electrostatic]] and [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] interactions as well as [[H-bonding]], [[dipole]] attraction, [[pi-stacking]], metal ion, [[Cation–pi interaction]], and [[hydrophobic]] effects, in addition to the molecule's conformation.&lt;ref name=Vosshall&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vosshall LB|title=Laying a controversial smell theory to rest|journal=Proc.

==Introduction==
The current vibration theory has recently been called the "swipe card" model, in contrast with "lock and key" models based on shape theory.&lt;ref name="titleAccess : Rogue theory of smell gets a boost : Nature News"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061204/full/news061204-10.html |title=Access : Rogue theory of smell gets a boost : Nature News |journal=Nature |date=7 December 2006 |pages=news061204–10 |doi=10.1038/news061204-10 |access-date=2008-04-11 |last1=Ball |first1=Philip }}&lt;/ref&gt; As proposed by [[Luca Turin]], the odorant molecule must first fit in the receptor's binding site.{{citation_needed|date=January 2015}} Then it must have a vibrational energy mode compatible with the difference in energies between two energy levels on the receptor, so electrons can travel through the molecule via inelastic [[electron tunneling]], triggering the [[signal transduction]] pathway.&lt;ref name="pmid8985605"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turin L |title=A spectroscopic mechanism for primary olfactory reception |journal=Chem. Senses |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=773–91 |year=1996 |pmid=8985605 |url=http://www.flexitral.com/research/chemical_senses_complete.pdf |doi=10.1093/chemse/21.6.773|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vibration theory is discussed in a popular but controversial book by Chandler Burr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses. |isbn=978-0-375-50797-7 |author=Burr, C. |year=2003 |publisher=Random House |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/emperorofscentst00burr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, A.|title=The Emperor's new theory|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=6|issue=4|pages=335|year=2003|doi =10.1038/nn0403-335|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The odor character is encoded in the ratio of activities of receptors tuned to different vibration frequencies, in the same way that [[color]] is encoded in the ratio of activities of [[cone cell]] receptors tuned to different frequencies of light. An important difference, though, is that the odorant has to be able to become resident in the receptor for a response to be generated. The time an odorant resides in a receptor depends on how strongly it binds, which in turn determines the strength of the response; the odor intensity is thus governed by a similar mechanism to the "lock and key" model.&lt;ref name="pmid8985605" /&gt; For a pure vibrational theory, the differing odors of enantiomers, which possess identical vibrations, cannot be explained. However, once the link between receptor response and duration of the residence of the odorant in the receptor is recognised, differences in odor between enantiomers can be understood: molecules with different handedness may spend different amounts of time in a given receptor, and so initiate responses of different intensities.

Seeing as there are some aroma molecules of different shapes that smell the same (eg. benzaldehyde, that gives the same scent to both almonds and/or cyanide), the shape "lock and key" model is not quite sufficient to explain what is going on. Experiments with olfaction, taking quantum mechanics into consideration, suggest that ultimately both theories might work in harmony - first the scent molecules need to fit, as in the [[docking theory of olfaction]] model, but then the molecular vibrations of the chemical/atom bonds take over. So in essence your sense of smell could be much more like your sense of hearing, where your nose could be 'listening' to the acoustic/vibrational bonds of aroma molecules.

Some studies support vibration theory while others challenge its findings.

==Major proponents and history==
The theory was first proposed by Malcolm Dyson in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dyson GM|title=Some aspects of the vibration theory of odor|journal=Perfumery and Essential Oil Record |volume=19|pages=456–459|year=1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded by Robert H. Wright in 1954, after which it was largely abandoned in favor of the competing shape theory. A 1996 paper by [[Luca Turin]] revived the theory by proposing a mechanism, speculating that the [[G-protein-coupled receptors]] discovered by [[Linda Buck]] and [[Richard Axel]] were actually measuring molecular vibrations using inelastic electron tunneling as Turin claimed, rather than responding to molecular keys fitting molecular locks, working by shape alone.&lt;ref name="pmid8985605"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/luca_turin_on_the_science_of_scent.html|title=TED Talks: Luca Turin {{!}} The science of scent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' paper by [[Marshall Stoneham]] and colleagues at [[University College London]] and [[Imperial College London]] showed that Turin's proposed mechanism was consistent with known physics and coined the expression "swipe card model" to describe it.&lt;ref name="pmid17358733"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brookes JC, Hartoutsiou F, Horsfield AP, Stoneham AM |title=Could humans recognize odor by phonon assisted tunneling? |journal=Phys.

===Isotope effects===
A major prediction of Turin's theory is the [[isotope]] effect: that the normal and [[deuterium|deuterated]] versions of a compound should smell different, although they have the same shape. A 2001 study by Haffenden ''et al.'' showed humans able to distinguish [[benzaldehyde]] from its deuterated version.&lt;ref name="Haffenden"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haffenden LJ, Yaylayan VA, Fortin J |title=Investigation of vibrational theory of olfaction with variously labelled benzaldehydes |journal=Food Chem. |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=67–72 |year=2001|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(00)00287-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titleDavid MacKay: Smells: Summary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/smell/ |title=David MacKay: Smells: Summary |access-date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this study has been criticized for lacking [[double-blind]] controls to eliminate bias and because it used an anomalous version of the [[duo-trio test]].&lt;ref name=Vosshall2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keller A, Vosshall LB |title=A psychophysical test of the vibration theory of olfaction|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=7|issue=4|pages=337–338|year=2004|doi =10.1038/nn1215|pmid=15034588|s2cid=1073550}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, tests with animals have shown fish and insects able to distinguish isotopes by smell.&lt;ref name="Havens"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Havens BR, Melone CD |title=The application of deuterated sex pheromone mimics of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana, L.), to the study of wright's vibrational theory of olfaction |journal=Dev.

Deuteration changes the heats of adsorption and the boiling and freezing points of molecules (boiling points:  100.0&amp;nbsp;°C for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. 101.42&amp;nbsp;°C for D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; melting points: 0.0&amp;nbsp;°C for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 3.82&amp;nbsp;°C for D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., [[dissociation constant]]: 9.71×10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vs. 1.95×10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; for D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, cf. [[Heavy water]]) and the strength of hydrogen bonding.  Such [[Kinetic isotope effect|isotope effects]] are exceedingly common, and so it is well known that deuterium substitution will indeed change the binding constants of molecules to protein receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schramm | first1 = V. L. | year = 2007 | title = Binding isotope effects: boon and bane | journal = Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. | volume = 11 | issue = 5| pages = 529–536 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.07.013 | pmid=17869163 | pmc=2066183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any binding interaction of an odorant molecule with an olfactory receptor will therefore be likely to show some isotope effect upon deuteration, and the observation of an isotope effect in no way argues exclusively for a vibrational theory of olfaction.

A study published in 2011 by Franco, Turin, Mershin and Skoulakis shows both that flies can smell deuterium, and that to flies, a carbon-deuterium bond smells like a [[nitrile]], which has a similar vibration. The study reports that [[drosophila melanogaster]] (fruit fly), which is ordinarily attracted to [[acetophenone]], spontaneously dislikes deuterated acetophenone. This dislike increases with the number of deuteriums. (Flies genetically altered to lack smell receptors could not tell the difference.) Flies could also be trained by electric shocks either to avoid the deuterated molecule or to prefer it to the normal one. When these trained flies were then presented with a completely new and unrelated choice of normal vs. deuterated odorants, they avoided or preferred deuterium as with the previous pair. This suggested that flies were able to smell deuterium regardless of the rest of the molecule. To determine whether this deuterium smell was actually due to vibrations of the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond or to some unforeseen effect of isotopes, the researchers looked to nitriles, which have a similar vibration to the C-D bond. Flies trained to avoid deuterium and asked to choose between a nitrile and its non-nitrile counterpart did avoid the nitrile, lending support to the idea that the flies are smelling vibrations.&lt;ref name=Franco/&gt; Further isotope smell studies are under way in fruit flies and dogs.&lt;ref name=Courtland2011/&gt;

===Explaining differences in stereoisomer scents===
[[Carvone]] presented a perplexing situation to vibration theory. Carvone has two [[isomer]]s, which have identical vibrations, yet one smells like [[Mentha|mint]] and the other like [[caraway]] (for which the compound is named).

An experiment by Turin filmed by the 1995 [[BBC Horizon]] documentary "A Code in the Nose" consisted of mixing the mint isomer with [[butanone]], on the theory that the shape of the [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] prevented the [[carbonyl group]] in the mint isomer from being detected by the "biological spectroscope". The experiment succeeded with the trained perfumers used as subjects, who perceived that a mixture of 60% butanone and 40% mint carvone smelled like caraway.

===The sulfurous smell of boranes===
According to Turin's original paper in the journal ''Chemical Senses'', the well documented smell of [[borane]] compounds is sulfurous, though these molecules contain no [[sulfur]]. He proposes to explain this by the similarity in frequency between the vibration of the B-H bond and the S-H bond.&lt;ref name="pmid8985605"/&gt; However, it has been pointed out that for ''o''-carborane, which has a very strong B−H stretch at 2575&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the "onion-like odor of crude commercial ''o''-carborane is replaced by a pleasant camphoraceous odor on careful purification, reflecting the method for commercial preparation of ''o''-carborane from reactions promoted by onion-smelling diethyl sulfide, which is removed on purification."&lt;ref name="PMID 30453735"/&gt;

===Consistency with physics===
Biophysical simulations published in ''Physical Review Letters'' in 2006 suggest that Turin's proposal is viable from a physics standpoint.&lt;ref name="pmid17358733" /&gt;&lt;ref name="titleRogue Odour Theory Could Be Right"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070204162541.htm |title=Rogue Odour Theory Could Be Right |access-date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Block et al. in their 2015 paper in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' indicate that their theoretical analysis shows that "the proposed [[electron transfer]] mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants&lt;ref name="pmid17358733" /&gt; could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes".&lt;ref name=Block/&gt;

===Correlating odor to vibration===
A 2004 paper published in the journal ''Organic Biomolecular Chemistry'' by Takane and Mitchell shows that odor descriptions in the olfaction literature correlate with EVA descriptors, which loosely correspond to the vibrational spectrum, better than with descriptors based on the two dimensional connectivity of the molecule. The study did not consider molecular shape.&lt;ref name="pmid15534702"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Takane SY, Mitchell JB |title=A structure-odour relationship study using EVA descriptors and hierarchical clustering |journal=Org. Biomol. Chem. |volume=2 |issue=22 |pages=3250–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15534702 |doi=10.1039/B409802A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of antagonists===
Turin points out that traditional lock-and-key receptor interactions deal with [[agonist]]s, which increase the receptor's time spent in the active state, and [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]], which increase the time spent in the inactive state. In other words, some [[ligand]]s tend to turn the receptor on and some tend to turn it off. As an argument against the traditional lock-and-key theory of smell, very few olfactory antagonists have been found.

In 2004, a Japanese research group published that an oxidation product of [[isoeugenol]] is able to antagonize, or prevent, mice olfactory receptor response to isoeugenol.&lt;ref name="pmid15574817"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oka Y, Nakamura A, Watanabe H, Touhara K |title=An odorant derivative as an antagonist for an olfactory receptor |journal=Chem.

===Additional challenges to the [[docking theory of olfaction]]===
*Similarly shaped molecules with different molecular vibrations have different smells ([[metallocene]] experiment and [[deuterium]] replacement of molecular [[hydrogen]]). However this challenge is contrary to the results obtained with silicon analogues of bourgeonal and [[lilial]], which despite their differences in molecular vibrations have similar smells and similarly activate the most responsive human receptor, hOR17-4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Doszczak, L |author2=Kraft, P |author3=Weber, H-P |author4=Bertermann, R |author5=Triller, A |author6=Hatt, H |author7=Reinhold Tacke, R |title=Prediction of Perception: Probing the hOR17-4 Olfactory Receptor Model with Silicon Analogues of Bourgeonal and Lilial |journal=Angew.

He suggests that "because of the change in size and mass, different metal atoms give different frequencies for those vibrations that involve the metal atoms,"&lt;ref name="pmid8985605" /&gt; an observation which is compatible with the vibration theory. However it has been noted that, in contrast to ferrocene, nickelocene rapidly decomposes in air and the cycloalkene odor observed for nickelocene, but not for ferrocene, could simply reflect decomposition of nickelocene giving trace amounts of hydrocarbons such as cyclopentadiene.&lt;ref name="PMID 30453735"/&gt;
*Differently shaped molecules with similar molecular vibrations have similar smells (replacement of  [[carbon]] double bonds by [[sulfur]] atoms and the disparate shaped [[amber]] odorants)
*Hiding [[functional group]]s does not hide the group's characteristic odor. However this is not always the case, since ''ortho''-substituted arylisonitriles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pirrung|first1=MC|last2=Ghorai |first2=S|last3=Ibarra-Rivera |first3=TR|title=Multicomponent Reactions of Convertible Isonitriles|journal=J.

==Challenges==
Three predictions by Luca Turin on the nature of smell, using concepts of vibration theory, were addressed by experimental tests published in [[Nature Neuroscience]] in 2004 by [[Leslie B. Vosshall|Vosshall]] and Keller.&lt;ref name=Vosshall2004/&gt; The study failed to support the prediction that isotopes should smell different, with untrained human subjects unable to distinguish [[acetophenone]] from its deuterated counterpart.&lt;ref name="pmid17358733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="titleRogue Odour Theory Could Be Right"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15048113"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Testing a radical theory |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=315 |year=2004 |pmid=15048113 |doi=10.1038/nn0404-315|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also pointed to experimental design flaws in the earlier study by Haffenden.&lt;ref name="Haffenden"/&gt; In addition, Turin's description of the odor of long-chain aldehydes as  alternately (1) dominantly waxy and faintly citrus and (2) dominantly citrus and faintly waxy was not supported by tests on untrained subjects, despite anecdotal support from fragrance industry professionals who work regularly with these materials. Vosshall and Keller also presented a mixture of [[guaiacol]] and [[benzaldehyde]] to subjects, to test Turin's theory that the mixture should smell of [[vanillin]]. Vosshall and Keller's data did not support Turin's prediction. However, Vosshall says these tests do not disprove the vibration theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockefeller.edu/pubinfo/news_notes/rus_032604_b.php "Putting a smell theory to the sniff test"], Renee Twombly; Rockefeller Scientist, March 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the 2011 PNAS study on flies, Vosshall acknowledged that flies could smell isotopes but called the conclusion that smell was based on vibrations an "overinterpretation" and expressed skepticism about using flies to test a mechanism originally ascribed to human receptors.&lt;ref name=Courtland2011&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Courtland | first = Rachel | title = Fly sniffs molecule's quantum vibrations | magazine = New Scientist | date = 14 February 2011 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20130-fly-sniffs-molecules-quantum-vibrations.html | access-date = 16 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the theory to be confirmed, Vosshall stated there must be further studies on mammalian receptors.&lt;ref name=Rinaldi2011&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2013, Turin and coworkers confirmed [[Vosshall]] and Keller's experiments showing that even trained human subjects were unable to distinguish [[acetophenone]] from its deuterated counterpart.&lt;ref name=Gane&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gane | first1 = S | last2 = Georganakis | first2 = D | last3 = Maniati | first3 = K | last4 = Vamvakias | first4 = M | last5 = Ragoussis | first5 = N | last6 = Skoulakis | first6 = EMC | last7 = Turin | first7 = L | year = 2013 | title = Molecular vibration-sensing component in human olfaction | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = e55780 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0055780 | pmid=23372854 | pmc=3555824| bibcode = 2013PLoSO...855780G | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Turin and coworkers reported that human volunteers were able to distinguish cyclopentadecanone from its fully deuterated analog. To account for the different results seen with acetophenone and cyclopentadecanone, Turin and coworkers assert that "there must be many C-H bonds before they are detectable by smell. In contrast to acetophenone which contains only 8 hydrogens, cyclopentadecanone has 28. This results in more than 3 times the number of vibrational modes involving hydrogens than in acetophenone, and this is likely essential for detecting the difference between isotopomers."&lt;ref name=Gane /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-01-olfactory-vibration-sensing-theory.html  New study strengthens olfactory vibration-sensing theory] Bob Yirka, Physorg, January 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Turin and coworkers provide no quantum mechanical justification for this latter assertion.

[[Vosshall]], in commenting on Turin's work, notes that "the olfactory membranes are loaded with enzymes that can metabolise odorants, changing their chemical identity and perceived odour. Deuterated molecules would be poor substrates for such enzymes, leading to a chemical difference in what the subjects are testing. Ultimately, any attempt to prove the vibrational theory of olfaction should concentrate on actual mechanisms at the level of the receptor, not on indirect psychophysical testing."&lt;ref name=RSC /&gt;  [[Richard Axel]] co-recipient of the 2004 Nobel prize for physiology for his work on olfaction, expresses a similar sentiment, indicating that Turin's work "would not resolve the debate – only a microscopic look at the receptors in the nose would finally show what is at work. Until somebody really sits down and seriously addresses the mechanism and not inferences from the mechanism... it doesn't seem a useful endeavour to use behavioural responses as an argument".&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In response to the 2013 paper on cyclopentadecanone,&lt;ref name=Gane/&gt; Block et al.&lt;ref name=Block/&gt; report that the human [[musk]]-recognizing receptor, OR5AN1, identified using a heterologous [[olfactory receptor]] expression system and robustly responding to cyclopentadecanone and [[muscone]] (which has 30 hydrogens), fails to distinguish [[isotopomers]] of these compounds in vitro. Furthermore, the mouse (methylthio)methanethiol-recognizing receptor, MOR244-3, as well as other selected human and mouse [[olfactory receptor]]s, responded similarly to normal, deuterated, and carbon-13 isotopomers of their respective ligands, paralleling results found with the musk receptor OR5AN1. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the proposed vibration theory does not apply to the human musk receptor OR5AN1, mouse thiol receptor MOR244-3, or other [[olfactory receptor]]s examined. Additionally, theoretical analysis by the authors shows that the proposed [[electron transfer]] mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes. The authors conclude: "These and other concerns about [[electron transfer]] at [[olfactory receptor]]s, together with our extensive experimental data, argue against the plausibility of the vibration theory."

In commenting on this work, [[Vosshall]] writes "In PNAS, Block et al.... shift the "shape vs. vibration" debate from olfactory psychophysics to the biophysics of the ORs themselves. The authors mount a sophisticated multidisciplinary attack on the central tenets of the vibration theory using synthetic organic chemistry, heterologous expression of [[olfactory receptor]]s, and theoretical considerations to find no evidence to support the vibration theory of smell."&lt;ref name=Vosshall/&gt; While [[Turin]] comments that Block used "cells in a dish rather than within whole organisms" and that "expressing an [[olfactory receptor]] in [[human embryonic kidney cell]]s doesn't adequately reconstitute the complex nature of [[olfaction]]...", [[Vosshall]] responds "Embryonic kidney cells are not identical to the cells in the nose ... but if you are looking at receptors, it's the best system in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Everts S | title=Receptor Research Reignites A Smelly Debate|journal=Chem.

Recently, Saberi and Allaei have suggested that a functional relationship exists between molecular volume and the olfactory neural response. The molecular volume is an important factor, but it is not the only factor that determines the response of ONRs. The binding affinity of an odorant-receptor pair is affected by their relative sizes. The maximum affinity can be attained when the molecular volume of an odorant matches the volume of the binding pocket.&lt;ref name="10.1101/013516"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saberi M, Seyed-allaei | title = Odorant receptors of Drosophila are sensitive to the molecular volume of odorants | year = 2016 | doi = 10.1038/srep25103  | journal = Scientific Reports | volume=6 | pages=25103 | pmid=27112241 | pmc=4844992| bibcode=2016NatSR...625103S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Na|first1=Mihwa|last2=Liu|first2=Min Ting|last3=Nguyen|first3=Minh Q.|last4=Ryan|first4=Kevin|date=2019-01-16|title=Single-Neuron Comparison of the Olfactory Receptor Response to Deuterated and Nondeuterated Odorants|journal=ACS Chemical Neuroscience|volume=10|issue=1|pages=552–562|doi=10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00416|pmid=30343564|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the responses of primary olfactory neurons in tissue culture to isotopes and finds that a small fraction of the population (&lt;1%) clearly discriminates between isotopes, some even giving an all-or-or -none response to H or D isotopomers of octanal.

      <text bytes="14456" xml:space="preserve">'''Viral eukaryogenesis''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the [[cell nucleus]] of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] life forms [[Evolution|evolved]] from a large [[DNA virus]] in a form of [[Endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]] within a [[Methanogenesis|methanogenic]] [[archaea|archaeon]] or a [[Bacteria|bacterium]]. The virus later evolved into the eukaryotic nucleus by acquiring [[gene]]s from the [[Host (biology)|host]] [[genome]] and eventually usurping its role. The hypothesis was first proposed by Philip Bell in 2001&lt;ref name="bell2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=Philip J. L. | title=Viral eukaryogenesis: was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? | journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume=53 | issue=3 | pages=251–6 | date=September 2001 | pmid=11523012 | doi=10.1007/s002390010215 | bibcode=2001JMolE..53..251L | s2cid=20542871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was further popularized with the discovery of large, complex DNA viruses (such as ''[[Mimivirus]]'') that are capable of [[protein biosynthesis]].

Viral eukaryogenesis has been controversial for several reasons. For one, it is sometimes argued that the posited evidence for the viral origins of the nucleus can be conversely used to suggest the nuclear origins of some viruses.&lt;ref name="jean" /&gt; Secondly, this hypothesis has further inflamed the longstanding debate over whether viruses are [[Life|living]] [[organisms]].&lt;ref name="jean" /&gt;

== Hypothesis ==

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis posits that eukaryotes are composed of three ancestral elements: a viral component that became the modern nucleus; a prokaryotic cell (an [[Archaea|archaeon]] according to the [[eocyte hypothesis]]) which donated the [[cytoplasm]] and [[cell membrane]] of modern cells; and another prokaryotic cell (here [[Bacteria|bacterium]]) that, by [[endocytosis]], became the modern [[mitochondrion]] or [[chloroplast]].

In 2006, researchers suggested that the transition from [[RNA]] to [[DNA]] genomes first occurred in the viral world.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Forterre |first=Patrick | title=Three RNA cells for ribosomal lineages and three DNA viruses to replicate their genomes: a hypothesis for the origin of cellular domain | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=103 | issue=10 | pages=3669–74 | date=March 2006 | pmid=16505372 | pmc=1450140 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0510333103 | bibcode=2006PNAS..103.3669F | jstor=30048645 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA-based virus may have provided storage for an ancient host that had previously used RNA to store its genetic information (such host is called ribocell or ribocyte).&lt;ref name="jean" /&gt; Viruses may initially have adopted DNA as a way to resist [[degradosome|RNA-degrading]] [[enzyme]]s in the host cells. Hence, the contribution from such a new component may have been as significant as the contribution from [[chloroplast]]s or [[mitochondria]]. Following this hypothesis, archaea, [[bacteria]], and eukaryotes each obtained their DNA informational system from a different virus.&lt;ref name="pnas" /&gt; In the original paper it was also an [[RNA]] cell at the origin of eukaryotes, but eventually more complex, featuring [[Post-transcriptional modification|RNA processing]]. Although this is in contrast to nowadays's more probable eocyte hypothesis, viruses seem to have contributed to the origin of all three domains of life ('out of virus hypothesis'). It has also been suggested that [[telomerase]] and [[telomeres]], key aspects of eukaryotic [[cell replication]], have viral origins. Further, the viral origins of the modern eukaryotic nucleus may have relied on multiple [[infections]] of archaeal cells carrying bacterial [[Symbiogenesis|mitochondrial precursors]] with [[Lysogenic cycle|lysogenic viruses]].&lt;ref name="witzany2008"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The viral origins of telomeres and telomerases and their important role in eukaryogenesis and genome maintenance |year=2008 |last1=Witzany |first1=Guenther |journal=Biosemiotics |url=http://www.mitdenker.at/life/Telomeres.pdf |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=191–206 |doi=10.1007/s12304-008-9018-0 |s2cid=207415262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis depicts a model of eukaryotic evolution in which a virus, similar to a modern [[pox virus]], evolved into a nucleus via gene acquisition from existing bacterial and archaeal species.&lt;ref name="takemura2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Takemura |first=M. | title=Poxviruses and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus | journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume=52 | issue=5 | pages=419–25 | date=May 2001 | pmid=11443345 | doi=10.1007/s002390010171 | bibcode=2001JMolE..52..419T | s2cid=21200827 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lysogenic virus then became the information storage center for the cell, while the cell retained its capacities for [[gene translation]] and general function despite the viral genome's entry. Similarly, the bacterial species involved in this eukaryogenesis retained its capacity to produce energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] while also passing much of its genetic information into this new virus-nucleus [[organelle]]. It is hypothesized that the modern [[cell cycle]], whereby [[mitosis]], [[meiosis]], and [[sex]] occur in all eukaryotes, [[Evolution|evolved]] because of the balances struck by viruses, which characteristically follow a pattern of tradeoff between infecting as many hosts as possible and killing an individual host through viral proliferation. Hypothetically, [[viral replication]] cycles may mirror those of [[plasmids]] and viral [[lysogens]]. However, this theory is controversial, and additional experimentation involving archaeal viruses is necessary, as they are probably the most evolutionarily similar to modern eukaryotic nuclei.&lt;ref name="bell2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell 2020"/&gt;

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis points to the cell cycle of eukaryotes, particularly sex and meiosis, as evidence.&lt;ref name="bell2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bell |first=Philip J. L. | title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=243 | issue=1 | pages=54–63 | date=November 2006 | pmid=16846615 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.05.015 | bibcode=2006JThBi.243...54B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the origins of DNA or reproduction in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.

== Supporting evidence ==

Recent supporting evidence includes the discovery that upon the infection of a [[bacteria]]l [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the giant [[bacteriophage]] ''201 Φ2-1'' (of the genus ''[[Phikzlikevirus|Phikzvirus]]'') assembles a nucleus-like structure around the region of genome replication and uncouples transcription and translation, and synthesized mRNA is then transported into the cytoplasm where it undergoes translation.&lt;ref name="Chaikeeratisak Nguyen Khanna 2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Chaikeeratisak | first=Vorrapon | last2=Nguyen | first2=Katrina | last3=Khanna | first3=Kanika | last4=Brilot | first4=Axel F. | last5=Erb | first5=Marcella L. | last6=Coker | first6=Joanna K.

L. |date=2020-11-01 |title=Evidence supporting a viral origin of the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Virus Research |volume=289 |pages=198168 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198168 |pmid=32961211 |s2cid=221864135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many classes of [[Nucleocytoviricota|nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]] (NCLDVs) such as [[mimivirus]]es have the apparatus to produce m7G capped mRNA and contain homologues of the eukaryotic cap-binding protein eIF4E. Those supporting viral eukaryogenesis also point to the lack of these features in archaea, and so believe that a sizable gap separates the archaeal groups most related to the eukaryotes and the eukaryotes themselves in terms of the nucleus. In light of these and other discoveries, Bell modified his original thesis to suggest that the viral ancestor of the nucleus was an NCLDV-like archaeal virus rather than a pox-like virus.&lt;ref name="Bell 2020"/&gt;
Another piece of supporting evidence is that the [[m7G]] capping apparatus (involved in uncoupling of transcription from translation) is present in both [[Eukarya]] and [[Mimiviridae]] but not in [[Lokiarchaeota]] that are considered the nearest archaeal relatives of Eukarya according to the [[Eocyte hypothesis]] (also supported by the phylogenetic analysis of the m7G [[Capping enzyme|capping]] pathway).&lt;ref name="Bell 2020"/&gt;

Several precepts in the theory are possible. For instance, a helical virus with a [[Lipid bilayer|bilipid]] [[Viral envelope|envelope]] bears a distinct resemblance to a highly simplified [[Cell nucleus|cellular nucleus]] (i.e., a DNA chromosome encapsulated within a lipid membrane). In theory, a large DNA virus could take control of a bacterial or archaeal cell.&lt;ref&gt;Takemura, M. (2020) Medusavirus Ancestor in a Proto-Eukaryotic Cell: Updating the Hypothesis for the Viral Origin of the Nucleus. Front. Microbiol. 11:571831. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.571831&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of replicating and destroying the [[host cell]], it would remain within the cell, thus overcoming the tradeoff dilemma typically faced by viruses. With the virus in control of the host cell's molecular machinery, it would effectively become a functional nucleus. Through the processes of mitosis and [[cytokinesis]], the virus would thus recruit the entire cell as a symbiont—a new way to survive and proliferate.

Viral eukaryogenesis has been controversial for several reasons. For one, it is sometimes argued that the posited evidence for the viral origins of the nucleus can be conversely used to suggest the nuclear origins of some viruses, i.e. the evolutionary connection exists but is in the reverse direction.&lt;ref name="jean" /&gt; Secondly, the hypothesis has further inflamed the longstanding debate over whether viruses are [[Life|living]] [[organisms]].&lt;ref name="jean" /&gt;

'''ViroCap''' is a test announced in 2015 by researchers at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] which can detect most of the infectious [[Virus|viruses]] which affect both [[Human|humans]] and [[Animal|animals]]. It was demonstrated to be as sensitive as the various [[Polymerase chain reaction]] assays for the viruses. It will not be available for clinical use until validation studies are done, which may take years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/09/29/New-test-detects-all-the-viruses-that-infect-people-animals/7991443551878/] Feller, Stephen "New test detects all the viruses that infect people, animals," UPI, 29 September 2015.

'''Virotherapy''' is a treatment using [[biotechnology]] to convert [[virus]]es into therapeutic agents by reprogramming viruses to treat diseases. There are three main branches of virotherapy: anti-cancer [[oncolytic virus]]es, [[viral vector]]s for [[gene therapy]] and viral [[immunotherapy]]. These branches use three different types of treatment methods: gene overexpression, gene knockout, and suicide gene delivery. Gene overexpression adds genetic sequences that compensate for low to zero levels of needed gene expression. Gene knockout uses RNA methods to silence or reduce expression of disease-causing genes. Suicide gene delivery introduces genetic sequences that induce an apoptotic response in cells, usually to kill cancerous growths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stephen |first1=Sam |title=How Science Is Using Viruses To Make You Better - CPI |url=https://www.uk-cpi.com/blog/how-science-is-using-viruses-to-make-you-better |website=CPI |access-date=31 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a slightly different context, virotherapy can also refer more broadly to the use of viruses to treat certain medical conditions by killing pathogens.

==History==
[[Chester M. Southam]], a researcher at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]], pioneered the study of viruses as potential agents to treat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sepkowitz |first1=Kent |date=24 August 2009 |title=West Nile Made Its U.S. Debut in the 1950s, in a Doctor's Syringe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/health/25nile.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oncolytic virotherapy==

{{Main|Oncolytic virus}}

Oncolytic virotherapy is not a new idea – as early as the mid 1950s doctors were noticing that cancer patients who suffered a non-related viral infection, or who had been vaccinated recently, showed signs of improvement;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=E|author2=Russell, SJ |title=History of oncolytic viruses: genesis to genetic engineering|journal=Molecular Therapy|date=April 2007|volume=15|issue=4|pages=651–9|pmid=17299401|doi=10.1038/sj.mt.6300108|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has been largely attributed to the production of [[interferon]] and tumour [[necrosis]] factors in response to viral infection, but [[oncolytic virus]]es are being designed that selectively target and [[lysis|lyse]] only cancerous cells.

In the 1940s and 1950s, studies were conducted in animal models to evaluate the use of viruses in the treatment of [[tumour]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=AE |title=The destructive effect of the virus of Russian Far East encephalitis on the transplantable mouse sarcoma 180|journal=Cancer|date=May 1949 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=525–34 |pmid=18131412|doi=10.1002/1097-0142(194905)2:3&lt;525::AID-CNCR2820020317&gt;3.0.CO;2-O|s2cid=8181568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1940s–1950s some of the earliest human [[clinical trial]]s with oncolytic viruses were started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical virotherapy: four historically significant clinical trials|url=http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v15/n4/fig_tab/6300108t1.html#figure-title}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huebner|first=RJ|author2=Rowe, WP |author3=Schatten, WE |author4=Smith, RR |author5= Thomas, LB |title=Studies on the use of viruses in the treatment of carcinoma of the cervix|journal=Cancer|date=Nov–Dec 1956 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=1211–8 |pmid=13383455 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(195611/12)9:6&lt;1211::AID-CNCR2820090624&gt;3.0.CO;2-7|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism===
It is believed that oncolytic virus achieve their goals by two mechanisms: selective killing of [[tumor]] cells as well as recruitment of host [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Engeland2020&gt;{{cite book|last=Engeland|first=Christine|author2=Bell, John|title=Oncolytic Viruses|chapter=Introduction to Oncolytic Virotherapy|series=Methods Mol Biol|year=2020|volume=2058|pages=1–6|pmid=31486028 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-9794-7_1|isbn=978-1-4939-9793-0|s2cid=201836470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawler2017&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawler|first=Sean|author2=Speranza, Maria-Carmela|author3=  Cho, Choi-Fong |title=Oncolytic Viruses in Cancer Treatment A Review|journal=JAMA Oncol|year=2017|volume=3|issue=6|pages=841–849|pmid=27441411 |doi=10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.2064|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major challenges in cancer treatment is finding treatments that target tumor cells while ignoring non-cancerous host cells. Viruses are chosen because they can target specific receptors expressed by cancer cells that allow for virus entry. One example of this is the targeting of CD46 on [[multiple myeloma]] cells by [[measles]] virus.&lt;ref name=Ong2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ong|first=Hooi Hooi Tin|author2=Timm, Michael M |author3=Greipp, Philip R |author4=Greipp, Philip R.|author5= Dispenzieri, Angela|author6= Russell, Stephen J. |author7=Peng, Kah-Whye |title=Oncolytic measles virus targets high CD46 expression on multiple myeloma cells |journal=Experimental Hematology|year=2006|volume=34|issue=6|pages=713–720|pmid=16728275 |doi=10.1016/j.exphem.2006.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of these receptors are often increased in tumor cells.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt; Viruses can also be engineered to target specific receptors on tumor cells as well.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt;  Once viruses have entered the tumor cell, the rapid growth and division of tumor cells as well as decreased ability of tumor cells to fight off viruses make them advantageous for viral replication compared to non-tumorous cells.&lt;ref name=Engeland2020/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt; The replication of viruses in tumor cells causes tumor cells to lyse killing them and also release signal to activate the host's own immune system, overcoming [[immunosuppression]]. This is done through the disruption of the [[Cancer immunology|microenvironment]] of the tumor cells that prevents recognition by host immune cells.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt; Tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular patterns are also released during the lysis process which helps recruit host immune cells.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt; Currently, there are many viruses being used and tested, all differing in their ability to lyse cells, activate the immune system, and transfer genes.

===Clinical development===
As of 2019, there are over 100 clinical trials looking at different viruses, cancers, doses, routes and administrations. Most of the work has been done on herpesvirus, adenovirus, and vaccinia virus, but other viruses include measles virus, coxsackievirus, polio virus, newcastle disease virus, and more.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zheng2019&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Meijun|author2=Huang, Jianhan | author3=Tong, Aiping| author4=Yang, Hui|title=Oncolytic viruses for cancer therapy: barriers and recent advances |journal=Mol Ther Oncolytics |year=2019|volume=15|pages=234–247|pmid=31872046 |doi=10.1016/j.omto.2019.10.007 |pmc=6911943|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of delivery tested include intratumoral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and more.&lt;ref name=Harrington2019&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Kevin|author2=Freeman, Daniel J. | author3= Kelly, Beth| author4= Harper, James | author5= Soria, Jean- Charles |title=Optimizing oncolytic virotherapy in cancer treatment |journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov |year=2019|volume=18|issue=9|pages=689–706|pmid= 31292532 |doi=10.1038/s41573-019-0029-0|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of tumor that are currently being study with oncolytic viruses include CNS tumors, renal cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, and more.&lt;ref name=Zheng2019/&gt; Oncolytic virotherapy as a monotherapy has also been tested in combination with other therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and immunotherapy.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zheng2019/&gt;

====Approved for clinical use====
In 2015 the FDA approved the marketing of [[talimogene laherparepvec]], a genetically engineered herpes virus, to treat [[melanoma]] lesions that cannot be operated on; as of 2019, it is the only oncolytic virus approved for clinical use. It is injected directly into the lesion.&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev/&gt;  As of 2016 there was no evidence that it extends the life of people with melanoma, or that it prevents metastasis.&lt;ref name=USlabel&gt;{{cite web|title=Imlygic label|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ApprovedProducts/UCM469575.pdf|publisher=FDA|access-date=16 October 2016|date=October 2015}} For label updates see [https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/cellulargenetherapyproducts/approvedproducts/ucm469411.htm FDA index page for BLA 125518]&lt;/ref&gt;  Two genes were removed from the virus – one that shuts down an individual cell's defenses, and another that helps the virus evade the immune system – and a gene for human [[GM-CSF]] was added.  The drug works by replicating in cancer cells, causing them to burst; it was also designed to stimulate an immune response but as of 2016, there was no evidence of this.&lt;ref name=Evans2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fukuhara2016rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fukuhara|first1=H|last2=Ino|first2=Y|last3=Todo|first3=T|title=Oncolytic virus therapy: A new era of cancer treatment at dawn.|journal=Cancer Science|date=3 August 2016|pmid=27486853|pmc=5084676|volume=107|issue=10|pages=1373–1379|doi=10.1111/cas.13027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drug was created and initially developed by BioVex, Inc. and was continued by [[Amgen]], which acquired BioVex in 2011.&lt;ref name=Acquisition&gt;{{cite news|title=Amgen to Buy BioVex, Maker of Cancer Drugs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/25amgen.html?_r=0|work=Bloomberg News via The New York Times|date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[oncolytic virus]] approved in the West.&lt;ref name=Evans2016rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bilsland|first1=AE|last2=Spiliopoulou|first2=P|last3=Evans|first3=TR|title=Virotherapy: cancer gene therapy at last?|journal=F1000Research|date=2016 |volume=5|pmid=27635234 |doi=10.12688/f1000research.8211.1|pmc=5007754|pages=2105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2019, the distribution of ECHO-7 in Latvia has been stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/health/rigvir-cancer-treatment-at-center-of-fresh-controversy.a313826/|title=Rigvir cancer treatment at center of fresh controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges and future prospective===
Although oncolytic viruses are engineered to specifically target tumor cells, there is always the potential for off-target effects leading to symptoms that are usually associated with that virus.&lt;ref name=Engeland2020/&gt; The most common symptom that has been reported has been [[Influenza|flu-like]] symptoms. The HSV virus used as an oncolytic virus has retained their native thymidine kinase gene which allows it to be targeted with antiretroviral therapy in the event of unwarranted side effects.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt;

Other challenges include developing an optimal method of delivery either directly to the tumor site or intravenously and allowing for target of multiple sites.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt; Clinical trials include the tracking of viral replication and spread using various laboratory techniques in order to find the optimal treatment.

Another major challenge with using oncolytic viruses as therapy is avoiding the host's natural immune system which will prevent the virus from infecting the tumor cells.&lt;ref name=Engeland2020/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt; Once the oncolytic virus is introduced to the host system, a healthy host's immune system will naturally try to fight off the virus. Because of this, if less virus is able to reach the target site, it can reduce the efficacy of the oncolytic virus. This leads to the idea that inhibiting the host's immune response may be necessary early in the treatment, but this is brought with safety concerns. Due to these safety concerns of [[immunosuppression]], clinical trials have excluded patients who are immunocompromised and have active viral infections.

==Viral gene therapy==
[[File:AAV Gene Therapy.jpg|thumb|218x218px|Viral gene therapy uses genetically engineered viral vectors to deliver a gene of interest to target cells.  An AAV-based vector is shown in this example.]]
Viral gene therapy uses genetically engineered viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes to cells with genetic malfunctions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/therapy/procedures|title=How does gene therapy work?|website=U.S. National Library of Medicine: Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism===
The use of viral material to deliver a gene starts with the engineering of the viral vector. Though the molecular mechanism of the viral vector differ from vector to vector, there are some general principles that are considered.

In diseases that are secondary to a genetic mutation that causes the lack of a gene, the gene is added back in.&lt;ref name=Dunbar2018&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=Cynthia|author2=High, Katherine | author3= Joung, J.

Jude| title=Engineering adeno-associated virus vectors for gene therapy |journal=Nat Rev Genet |year=2020|volume=21|issue=4|pages=255–272|pmid= 32042148 |doi=10.1038/s41576-019-0205-4|s2cid=211067853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the former, the viral vector is delivered directly to the organ or the tissue of the patient. In the later, the desired tissue is first retrieved, genetically modified, and then transferred back to the patient. The molecular mechanisms of gene delivery and/or integration into cells vary based on the viral vector that is used.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;
Rather than delivery of drugs that require multiple and continuous treatments. Delivery of a gene has the potential to create a long lasting cell that can continuously produce gene product.&lt;ref name=Dunbar2018/&gt;

===Clinical development===
There has been a few successful clinical use of viral gene therapy since the 2000s, specifically with adeno-associated virus vectors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.

====Approved for clinical use====

=====Adeno-associated virus=====
Vectors made from [[Adeno-associated virus]] are one of most established products used in clinical trials today. It was initially attractive for the use of gene therapy due to it not being known to cause any disease along with several other features.&lt;ref name=Li2020/&gt; It has also been engineered so that it does not replicate after the delivery of the gene.&lt;ref name=Li2020/&gt;

* In 2017, the [[FDA]] approved [[Spark Therapeutics]]' [[Voretigene neparvovec|Luxturna]], an AAV vector-based gene therapy product for the treatment of ''[[RPE65]]'' mutation-associated [[Cone dystrophy|retinal dystrophy]] in adults.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-gene-therapy-treat-patients-rare-form-inherited-vision-loss|title=FDA approves novel gene therapy to treat patients with a rare form of inherited vision loss|date=2017-12-18|website=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/media/109906/download|title=Package Insert - LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl)|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|format=PDF|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxturna is the first gene therapy approved in the US for the treatment of a monogenetic disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/19/571962226/first-gene-therapy-for-inherited-disease-gets-fda-approval|title=First Gene Therapy For Inherited Disease Gets FDA Approval|last=Stein|first=Rob|date=2017-12-19|newspaper=NPR|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been authorized for use in the EU since 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/overview/luxturna-epar-medicine-overview_en.pdf|title=Luxturna : EPAR - Medicine overview|publisher=European Medicines Agency|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2019, the FDA approved [[Zolgensma]], an AAV vector-based gene therapy product for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in children under the age of two.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/media/126109/download|title=Package Insert - ZOLGENSMA|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|format=PDF|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of August 2019, it is the world's most expensive treatment, at a cost of over two million [[USD]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fda-novartis-idUSKCN1UX1KA|title=Novartis says it knew of Zolgensma data problems before U.S. approval|last=Erman|first=Michael|date=2019-08-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novartis is still seeking marketing approval for the drug in the EU as of 2019.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In additional, other clinical trials involving AAV-gene therapy looks to treat diseases such as [[Haemophilia]] along with various neurological, cardiovascular, and muscular diseases.&lt;ref name=Li2020/&gt;

=====Chimeric antigen receptor T cells=====
[[Chimeric antigen receptor T cell]] (CAR T cell) are a type of immunotherapy that makes use of viral gene editing. CAR T cell use an ex vivo method in which T lymphocytes are extracted and engineered with a virus typically gammaretrovirus or [[lentivirus]] to recognize specific proteins on cell surfaces.&lt;ref name=Dunbar2018/&gt;&lt;ref name= Feins2019&gt;{{cite journal|last= Feins|first=Steven |author2=Kong, Weimin | author3= Williams, Erik F.| author4=  Milone, Michael C. |author5= Fraietta, Joseph A.|title=An introduction to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell immunotherapy for human cancer |journal=Am J Hematol |year=2019 |volume=94 |issue=S1 |pages=S3–S9 |pmid= 30680780 |doi=10.1002/ajh.25418|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes the T-lymphocytes to attack the cells that express the undesired protein. Currently two therapies, [[Tisagenlecleucel]] and [[Axicabtagene ciloleucel]] are FDA-approved to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma respectively.&lt;ref name=Dunbar2018/&gt; Clinical trials are underway to explore its potential benefits in solid malignancies.&lt;ref name=Dunbar2018/&gt;

====Others====
In 2012 the [[European Commission]] approved [[Alipogene tiparvovec|Glybera]], an AAV vector-based gene therapy product for the treatment of [[lipoprotein lipase deficiency]] in adults.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/overview/glybera-epar-summary-public_en.pdf|title=Glybera: EPAR - Summary for the public|publisher=European Medicines Agency|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first gene therapy approved in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-20179561|title=Gene therapy: Glybera approved by European Commission|last=Gallagher|first=James|date=2012-11-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2019-11-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug never received FDA approval in the US, and was discontinued by its manufacturer {{Proper name|uniQure}} in 2017 due to profitability concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniqure.com/GL_PR_Glybera%20withdrawal_FINAL_PDF.pdf|title=uniQure Announces It Will Not Seek Marketing Authorization Renewal for Glybera in Europe|publisher=uniQure|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2019}} it is no longer authorized for use in the EU.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Challenges and future prospective===
Currently, there are still many challenges of viral gene therapy. [[Immune response]]s to viral gene therapies pose a challenge to successful  treatment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bessis|first1=N.|last2=GarciaCozar|first2=F. J.|last3=Boissier|first3=M.-C.|date=2004|title=Immune responses to gene therapy vectors: influence on vector function and effector mechanisms|journal=Gene Therapy|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=S10–S17|doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3302364|pmid=15454952|issn=1476-5462|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, responses to viral vectors at [[immune privilege]]d sites such as the eye may be reduced compared to other sites of the body.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Ru|last2=Caspi|first2=Rachel R|date=2010-01-18|title=Ocular immune privilege|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=2|doi=10.3410/B2-3|issn=1757-594X|pmc=2948372|pmid=20948803}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other forms of virotherapy, prevention of off-target genome editing is a concern. In addition to viral gene editing, other genome editing technologies such as [[CRISPR gene editing]] have been shown to be more precise with more control over the delivery of genes.&lt;ref name=Dunbar2018/&gt; As genome editing become a reality, it is also necessary to consider the [[Genetic engineering|ethical implications]] of the technology.

==Viral immunotherapy==
Viral immunotherapy is the use of virus to stimulate the body's immune system. Unlike traditional [[vaccine]]s, in which attenuated or killed virus/bacteria is used to generate an immune response, viral immunotherapy uses genetically engineered viruses to present a specific antigen to the immune system. That antigen could be from any species of virus/bacteria or even human disease antigens, for example cancer antigens.

Vaccines are another method of virotherapy that use attenuated or inactivated viruses to develop immunity to disease. An attenuated virus is a weakened virus that incites a natural immune response in the host that is often undetectable. The host also develops potentially life-long immunity due to the attenuated virus's similarity to the actual virus. Inactivated viruses are killed viruses that present a form of the antigen to the host. However, long-term immune response is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Services |first1=U.S. Department of Health and Human |title=Vaccines.gov |url=https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/types/index.html |website=www.vaccines.gov |date=26 April 2021 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer treatment===
Viral immunotherapy in the context of cancer stimulates the body's immune system to better fight against cancer cells. Rather than preventing causes of cancer, as one would traditionally think in the context of vaccines, vaccines against cancer are used to treat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy/cancer-vaccines.html|title=Cancer Vaccines and Their Side Effects|website=cancer.org|access-date=2021-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism is dependent upon the virus and treatment. Oncolytic viruses, as discussed in previous section, is stimulate host immune system through the release of tumor-associated antigens upon lysis as well as through the disruption of the cancer's microenvironment which helps them avoid the host immune system.&lt;ref name=Lawler2017/&gt; CAR T Cells, also mentioned in previous section, is another form of viral immunotherapy that uses viruses to genetically engineer immune cells to kill cancer cells.&lt;ref name=Dunbar2018/&gt;

==Other projects and products==

===Protozoal virotherapy===

Viruses have been explored as a means to treat infections caused by [[protozoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keen | first1 = E. C. | title = Beyond phage therapy: Virotherapy of protozoal diseases | doi = 10.2217/FMB.13.48 | journal = Future Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 821–823 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23841627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hyman | first1 = P. | last2 = Atterbury | first2 = R. | last3 = Barrow | first3 = P. | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2013.02.006 | title = Fleas and smaller fleas: Virotherapy for parasite infections | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 215–220 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23540830}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such protozoa that potential virotherapy treatments have explored is ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'', which causes [[primary amebic meningoencephalitis]] (PAM). With a mortality rate of 95%, this disease-causing eukaryote has one of the highest pathogenic fatality rates known. Chemotherapeutic agents that target this amoeba for treating PAM have difficulty crossing blood-brain barriers. However, the driven{{what|date=May 2022}} evolution of virulent viruses of protozoal pathogens (VVPPs) may be able to develop viral therapies that can more easily access this eukaryotic disease organism by crossing the blood-brain barrier in a process analogous to [[bacteriophage]]s. These VVPPs would also be self-replicating and therefore require infrequent administration, with lower doses, thus potentially reducing toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keen |first1=Eric C |title=Beyond phage therapy: virotherapy of protozoal diseases |journal=Future Microbiology |date=July 2013 |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=821–823 |doi=10.2217/fmb.13.48 |pmid=23841627}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these treatment methods for protozoal disease may show great promise in a manner similar to bacteriophage viral therapy, a notable hazard is the evolutionary consequence of using viruses capable of eukaryotic pathogenicity. VVPPs will have evolved mechanisms of DNA insertion and replication that manipulate eukaryotic surface proteins and [[DNA editing]] proteins. VVPP engineering must therefore control for viruses that may be able to mutate and thereby bind to surface proteins and manipulate the DNA of the infected host.

The '''Virtual Microscope''' project is an initiative to make [[micromorphology]] and [[behavior]] of some small organisms available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UD Virtual Compound Microscope|url=https://www.udel.edu/biology/ketcham/microscope/scope.html|publisher=[[University of Delaware]]|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images are from [[Antarctica]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] are available at no cost. Images are offered in higher [[magnification]] or lower resolution. Varieties of images offer can include [[scanning electron microscopy]], [[transmission electron microscopy]], and are accompanied by related publications for research. The site interface is deliberately kept simple with tutorials offered in several areas. The editorial board consists of professors from several universities worldwide{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. Its global scope was added after its foundation, and it supervised by [[Rutgers University]].

== Functioning ==
Different substances have interactions between microbicides and viruses such as:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Alteration of the viral envelope
* Structural alteration
* Alteration of viral markers or
* Alteration of the viral genome
The exact mechanisms, for example of Iodine (PVP-I) are still not clear, but it is targeting the bacterial protein synthesis due to disruption of electron transport, DNA denaturation or disruptive effects on the virus membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iodine: An Elemental Force Against Infection|url=https://www.reviewofophthalmology.com/article/iodine-an-elemental-force-against-infection|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.reviewofophthalmology.com|vauthors=Abelson MB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2021, a Press Briefing by ''White House COVID-19 Response Team and Public Health Officials'' mentions that "Cleaning with household cleaners containing soap or detergent will physically remove germs from surfaces.  This process does not necessarily kill germs, but reduces the risk of infection by removing them. Disinfecting uses a chemical product, which is a process that kills the germs on the surfaces. In most situations, regular cleaning of surfaces with soap and detergent, not necessarily disinfecting those surfaces, is enough to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread. Disinfection is only recommended in indoor settings — schools and homes — where there has been a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 within the last 24 hours.

'''Virus classification''' is the process of naming [[virus]]es and placing them into a [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] system similar to the classification systems used for [[cell (biology)|cellular organisms]].

Viruses are classified by [[phenotypic]] characteristics, such as [[Virus#Structure|morphology]], [[nucleic acid]] type, mode of replication, [[Host (biology)|host organism]]s, and the type of [[disease]] they cause. The formal taxonomic classification of viruses is the responsibility of the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) system, although the [[Baltimore classification]] system can be used to place viruses into one of seven groups based on their manner of mRNA synthesis. Specific naming conventions and further classification guidelines are set out by the ICTV.

A catalogue of all the world's known viruses has been proposed and, in 2013, some preliminary efforts were underway.&lt;ref name="NYT-20130905"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl | name-list-style = vanc |author-link=Carl Zimmer |title=A Catalog for All the World's Viruses? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/science/a-catalog-for-all-the-worlds-viruses.html |date=5 September 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=6 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{see also|Viral quasispecies}}

=== Species definition ===
Species form the basis for any biological classification system. Before 1982, it was thought that viruses could not be made to fit [[Ernst Mayr]]'s reproductive concept of species, and so were not amenable to such treatment. In 1982, the ICTV started to define a species as "a cluster of strains" with unique identifying qualities. In 1991, the more specific principle that a virus species is a [[wikt:polythetic|polythetic]] class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche was adopted.&lt;ref name=alimpiev&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alimpiev |first1=Egor |title=Rethinking the Virus Species Concept |date=March 15, 2019 |url=https://stanford.edu/~alimpiev/thnk_ppr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the ICTV definition of species changed to state: "A species is a [[monophyletic]] group of viruses whose properties can be distinguished from those of other species by multiple criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams MJ, Lefkowitz EJ, King AM, Carstens EB | title = Recently agreed changes to the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2633–9 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23836393 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1749-9 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria include the structure of the [[capsid]], the existence of an envelope, the gene expression program for its proteins, host range, [[pathogen]]icity, and most importantly genetic sequence similarity and phylogenetic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/w/ictv-taxonomy|title=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)|website=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)|language=en|access-date=2021-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual criteria used vary by the taxon, and can be inconsistent (arbitrary similarity thresholds) or unrelated to lineage (geography) at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=A Townsend |title=Defining viral species: making taxonomy useful |journal=Virology Journal |date=23 July 2014 |volume=11 |issue=1 |page=131 |doi=10.1186/1743-422X-11-131 |pmid=25055940 |pmc=4222810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter is, for many, not yet settled.&lt;ref name=alimpiev/&gt;

=== Virus definition ===
The currently accepted and formal definition of a 'virus' was accepted by the ICTV Executive Committee in November 2020 and ratified in March 2021, and is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koonin|first1=Eugene V.|last2=Dolja|first2=Valerian V.|last3=Krupovic|first3=Mart|last4=Kuhn|first4=Jens H.|date=2021-09-01|title=Viruses Defined by the Position of the Virosphere within the Replicator Space|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=85|issue=4|pages=e0019320|language=EN|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00193-20|pmc=8483706|pmid=34468181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Viruses ''sensu stricto'' are defined operationally by the ICTV as a type of MGE ([[mobile genetic element]]) that encodes at least one protein that is a major component of the virion encasing the nucleic acid of the respective MGE and therefore the gene encoding the major virion protein itself or MGEs that are clearly demonstrable to be members of a line of evolutionary descent of such major virion protein-encoding entities. Any monophyletic group of MGEs that originates from a virion protein-encoding ancestor should be classified as a group of viruses.}}

[[File:Comparison 1991 and 2019 virus taxonomy ICTV.webp|thumb|Comparison 1991 and 2018b virus taxonomy by ICTV|upright=1.4]]

The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] began to devise and implement rules for the naming and classification of viruses early in the 1970s, an effort that continues to the present. The ICTV is the only body charged by the [[International Union of Microbiological Societies]] with the task of developing, refining, and maintaining a universal virus taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lefkowitz EJ, Dempsey DM, Hendrickson RC, Orton RJ, Siddell SG, Smith DB | title = Virus taxonomy: the database of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 46 | issue = D1 | pages = D708–D717 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29040670 | pmc = 5753373 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system shares many features with the classification system of cellular [[organism]]s, such as [[taxon]] structure. However, some differences exist, such as the universal use of italics for all taxonomic names, unlike in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] and [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]].&lt;ref name=ictvcode &gt;{{cite web|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/information/w/ictv-information/383/ictv-code|title=ICTV Code|website=talk.ictvonline.org|publisher=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|access-date=26 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viral classification starts at the level of realm and continues as follows, with the taxonomic suffixes in parentheses:&lt;ref name=ictvcode /&gt;

:[[Realm (virology)|Realm]] (''-viria'')
::Subrealm (''-vira'')
:::[[Kingdom (biology)#Viruses|Kingdom]] (''-virae'')
::::Subkingdom (''-virites'')
:::::[[Phylum]] (''-viricota'')
::::::Subphylum (''-viricotina'')
:::::::[[Class (biology)|Class]] (''-viricetes'')
::::::::Subclass (''-viricetidae'')
:::::::::[[Order (biology)|Order]] (''-virales'')
::::::::::Suborder (''-virineae'')
:::::::::::[[Family (biology)|Family]] (''-viridae'')
::::::::::::Subfamily (''-virinae'')
:::::::::::::[[Genus]] (''-virus'')
::::::::::::::Subgenus (''-virus'')
:::::::::::::::[[Species]]

Unlike the system of [[binomial nomenclature]] adopted in cellular species, there is currently no standardized form for virus species names. At present, the ICTV mandates that a species name must contain as few words as possible while remaining distinct, and must not only contain the word virus and the host name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature |url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/information/w/ictv-information/383/ictv-code |website=ICTV |publisher=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses |access-date=2 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species names often take the form of ''[Disease] virus'', particularly for higher plants and animals. In 2019, the ICTV published a proposal to adopt a more formalized system of binomial nomenclature for virus species names, to be voted on in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siddell |first1=Stuart |last2=Walker |first2=Peter |last3=Lefkowitz |first3=Elliot |last4=Mushegian |first4=Arcady |last5=Dutilh |first5=Bas |last6=Harrach |first6=Balázs |last7=Harrison |first7=Robert |last8=Junglen |first8=Sandra |last9=Knowles |first9=Nick |last10=Kropinski |first10=Andrew |last11=Krupovic |first11=Mart |last12=Kuhn |first12=Jens |last13=Nibert |first13=Max |last14=Rubino |first14=Luisa |last15=Sabanadzovic |first15=Sead |last16=Simmonds |first16=Peter |last17=Varsani |first17=Arvind |last18=Zerbini |first18=Francisco |last19=Davison |first19=Andrew |title=Binomial nomenclature for virus species: a consultation |journal=Arch Virol |date=3 December 2019 |volume=165 |issue=2 |pages=519–525 |doi=10.1007/s00705-019-04477-6|pmid=31797129 |pmc=7026202 |ref=Archvir|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some virologists later objected to the potential naming system change, arguing that the debate came while many in the field were preoccupied due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallapaty |first1=Smriti |title=Should virus-naming rules change during a pandemic? The question divides virologists |journal=Nature |date=30 July 2020 |volume=584 |issue=7819 |pages=19–20 |doi=10.1038/d41586-020-02243-2|pmid=32733098 |bibcode=2020Natur.584...19M |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2019, all levels of taxa except subrealm, subkingdom, and subclass are used. Four realms, one ''[[incertae sedis]]'' order, 24 ''incertae sedis'' families, and three ''incertae sedis'' genera are recognized:&lt;ref name="Virus Taxonomy 2019"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/|title=Virus Taxonomy: 2019 Release|website=talk.ictvonline.org|publisher=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|access-date=26 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure-based virus classification===
{{see also|List of higher virus taxa}}
It has been suggested that similarity in virion assembly and structure observed for certain viral groups infecting hosts from different domains of life (e.g., bacterial tectiviruses and eukaryotic adenoviruses or prokaryotic Caudovirales and eukaryotic herpesviruses) reflects an evolutionary relationship between these viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bamford DH | title = Do viruses form lineages across different domains of life? | journal = Research in Microbiology | volume = 154 | issue = 4 | pages = 231–6 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12798226 | doi = 10.1016/S0923-2508(03)00065-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, structural relationship between viruses has been suggested to be used as a basis for defining higher-level taxa – structure-based viral lineages – that could complement the ICTV classification scheme of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krupovič M, Bamford DH | title = Order to the viral universe | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 84 | issue = 24 | pages = 12476–9 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20926569 | pmc = 3004316 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01489-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICTV has gradually added many higher-level taxa using relationships in protein folds. All four realms defined in the 2019 release are defined by the presence of a protein of a certain structural family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/|title=Virus Taxonomy: 2019 Release|last=|first=|date=|website=talk.ictvonline.org|publisher=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|access-date=26 April 2020|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Baltimore classification}}
[[File:Baltimore Classification.svg|right|thumb|300px|The Baltimore Classification of viruses is based on the method of viral [[mRNA]] synthesis]]
Baltimore classification (first defined in 1971) is a classification system that places viruses into one of seven groups depending on a combination of their [[nucleic acid]] ([[DNA]] or [[RNA]]), strandedness (single-stranded or double-stranded), [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]], and method of [[Viral replication|replication]]. Named after [[David Baltimore]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning biologist, these groups are designated by [[Roman numerals]]. Other classifications are determined by the disease caused by the virus or its morphology, neither of which are satisfactory due to different viruses either causing the same disease or looking very similar. In addition, viral structures are often difficult to determine under the microscope. Classifying viruses according to their [[genome]] means that those in a given category will all behave in a similar fashion, offering some indication of how to proceed with further research. Viruses can be placed in one of the seven following groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.web-books.com/MoBio/Free/Ch1E2.htm "Baltimore Classification of Viruses"] (Website.) ''Molecular Biology Web Book - http://web-books.com/''. Retrieved on 2008-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA viruses===
{{details|DNA virus}}

Viruses with a DNA [[genome]], except for the DNA [[Virus classification#Reverse transcribing viruses|reverse transcribing viruses]], are members of three of the four recognized [[Realm (virology)|viral realms]]: ''[[Duplodnaviria]]'', ''[[Monodnaviria]]'', and ''[[Varidnaviria]]''. But the ''[[incertae sedis]]'' order ''[[Ligamenvirales]]'', and many other ''incertae sedis'' families and genera, are also used to classify DNA viruses. The domains ''Duplodnaviria'' and ''Varidnaviria'' consist of double-stranded DNA viruses; other double-stranded DNA viruses are ''incertae sedis''. The domain ''Monodnaviria'' consists of single-stranded DNA viruses that generally encode a [[HUH-tag|HUH]] [[endonuclease]]; other single-stranded DNA viruses are ''incertae sedis''.&lt;ref name="Virus Taxonomy 2019"/&gt;
* '''Group I''': viruses possess double-stranded DNA. Viruses that cause [[chickenpox]] and [[herpes]] are found here.
* '''Group II''': viruses possess single-stranded DNA.

===Reverse transcribing viruses===
All viruses that encode a [[reverse transcriptase]] (also known as RT or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) are members of the class ''[[Revtraviricetes]]'', within the phylum ''Arterviricota'', kingdom ''Pararnavirae'', and realm ''[[Riboviria]]''. The class ''Blubervirales'' contains the single family ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'' of DNA RT (reverse transcribing) viruses; all other RT viruses are members of the class [[Ortervirales]].&lt;ref name="Riboviria"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Proposal: Create a megataxonomic framework, filling all principal taxonomic ranks, for realm Riboviria|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/p/taxonomy-history?taxnode_id=201907238|last=Koonin EV, Dolja VV, Krupovic M, Varsani A, Wolf YI, Yutin N, Zerbini M, Kuhn JH|website=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)|language=en|access-date=2020-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Group VI''': viruses possess single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate. The [[retrovirus]]es are included in this group, of which [[HIV]] is a member.

== Historical systems ==

=== Holmes classification ===
[[Francis O. Holmes|Holmes]] (1948) used a [[Linnaean taxonomy]] with [[binomial nomenclature]] to classify viruses into 3 groups under one order, [[Virales]]. They are placed as follows:
* '''Group I:''' ''[[Bacteriophage|Phaginae]]'' (attacks bacteria)
* '''Group II:''' ''[[Plant virus|Phytophaginae]] ''(attacks plants)
* '''Group III:''' ''[[Animal virus|Zoophaginae]]'' (attacks animals)

The system was not accepted by others due to its neglect of morphological similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kuhn |first1=Jens H. |chapter=Virus Taxonomy |title=Reference Module in Life Sciences |journal=Encyclopedia of Virology |date=2020 |pages=28–37 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-809633-8.21231-4 |isbn=978-0-12-809633-8 |pmc=7157452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subviral agents==

The following [[infectious agent]]s are smaller than viruses and have only some of their properties.&lt;ref name="subviral"&gt;{{Cite web |title=ICTV 9th Report (2011) Subviral Agents |url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/sub-viral-agents-2011/ |access-date=2020-06-15 |website=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses}} ([https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/subviral-agents/ updated version in sync with current release])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STRAUSS STRAUSS 2008 pp. 345–368"&gt;{{cite book | last1=STRAUSS | first1=JAMES H. | last2=STRAUSS | first2=ELLEN G. | title=Viruses and Human Disease | chapter=Subviral Agents | publisher=Elsevier | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-12-373741-0 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-373741-0.50012-x | pages=345–368| s2cid=80872659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, the ICTV has allowed them to be classified in a similar way as viruses are.&lt;ref&gt;TaxoProp 2015.002aG&lt;/ref&gt;

====Satellites====
{{main|Satellite (biology)}}
Satellites depend on co-infection of a host cell with a [[helper virus]] for productive multiplication. Their nucleic acids have substantially distinct nucleotide sequences from either their helper virus or host. When a satellite subviral agent encodes the coat protein in which it is encapsulated, it is then called a satellite virus.

Satellite-like nucleic acids resemble satellite nucleic acids, in that they replicate with the aid of helper viruses. However they differ in that they can encode functions that can contribute to the success of their helper viruses; while they are sometimes considered to be genomic elements of their helper viruses, they are not always found within their helper viruses.&lt;ref name="subviral"/&gt;

The '''Visible Embryo Project''' ('''VEP''') is a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary research project originally created in the early 1990s as a collaboration between the Developmental Anatomy Center at the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]] and the Biomedical Visualization Laboratory (BVL) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], "to develop software strategies for the development of distributed biostructural databases using cutting-edge technologies for high-performance computing and communications (HPCC), and to implement these tools in the creation of a large-scale digital archive of multidimensional data on normal and abnormal human development."&lt;ref name="processing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Doyle | first1=Michael D. | last2=Ang | first2=Cheong | last3=Raju | first3=Rakesh | last4=Klein | first4=Gary | last5=Williams | first5=Betsey S. | last6=DeFanti | first6=Thomas | last7=Goshtasby | first7=Ardeshir | last8=Grzesczuk | first8=Robert | last9=Noe | first9=Adrianne | title=Processing of cross-sectional image data for reconstruction of human developmental anatomy from museum specimens | journal=ACM SIGBIO Newsletter | publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) | volume=13 | issue=1 | year=1993 | issn=0163-5697 | doi=10.1145/163424.163426 | pages=9–15| s2cid=1901140 }} &lt;/ref&gt; This project related to BVL's other research in the areas of health informatics, educational multimedia, and biomedical imaging science.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite conference | last=Doyle | first=M. | title=Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Volume 13: 1991 | chapter=The Metamap Process: A New Approach To The Creation Of Object Oriented Image Databases For Medical Education | year=1991 | pages=1046–1047 | publisher=IEEE | doi=10.1109/iembs.1991.684333| isbn=0-7803-0216-8 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="modeling"&gt; {{cite journal | last1=Carlbom | first1=Ingrid | last2=Hsu | first2=William M. | last3=Klinker | first3=Gudrun | last4=Szeliski | first4=Richard | last5=Waters | first5=Keith | last6=Doyle | first6=Michael | last7=Gettys | first7=Jim | last8=Harris | first8=Kristen M. | last9=Levergood | first9=Thomas M. | last10=Palmer | first10=Ricky | last11=Palmer | first11=Larry | last12=Picart | first12=Marc | last13=Terzopoulos | first13=Demetri | last14=Tonnesen | first14=David | last15=Vannier | first15=Michael | last16=Wallace | first16=Greg | title=Modeling and analysis of empirical data in collaborative environments | journal=Communications of the ACM | publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) | volume=35 | issue=6 | year=1992 | issn=0001-0782 | doi=10.1145/129888.129893 | pages=74–84| s2cid=27152196 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1=Doyle | first1=M. | last2=Majumbar | first2=S. | title=Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Volume 13: 1991 | chapter=The Use Of Fractal Analysis In The Screening Of Medical/dental X- Ray And Tomographic Images For Early Signs Of Osteoporosis | year=1991 | pages=2234–2235 | publisher=IEEE | doi=10.1109/iembs.1991.684978| isbn=0-7803-0216-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the following decades, the list of VEP collaborators grew to include over a dozen universities, national laboratories, and companies around the world.

An early (1993) goal of the project was to enable what it called "Spatial Genomics," to create tools and systems for three-dimensional morphological mapping of [[gene expression]], to correlate data from the [[Human Genome Project]] with the multidimensional location of [[Genomics | genomic]] expression activity within the morphological context of organisms.  This led to the invention in the late 1990s by VEP collaborators of the first system for [[Spatial transcriptomics]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doyle MD, Noe A, Michaels GS | title = The Visible Embryo Project: A Platform for Spatial Genomics | journal = Proceedings of SPIE | volume = 3905 | date = 2000 | page = 248 | doi = 10.1117/12.384880 | bibcode = 2000SPIE.3905..248D | s2cid = 85027703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="patent7613571"&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=7613571|title=Method and system for the multidimensional morphological reconstruction of genome expression activity|pubdate=2009-11-03|inventor1-last=Doyle|inventor1-first=Michael D.|inventor2-last=Pescitelli, Jr.|inventor2-first=Maurice J.|inventor3-last=Williams|inventor3-first=Betsey S.|inventor4-last=Michaels|inventor4-first=George S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other areas that VEP researchers pioneered include early web technologies, cloud computing, blockchain, and virtual assistant technology.

==Early history==

The VEP was created in 1992 as a collaboration between the UIC Biomedical Visualization Laboratory, directed by Michael Doyle, and the  Human Developmental Anatomy Center at the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM), directed by Adrianne Noe.  Doyle had been appointed to the oversight committee of the [[Visible Human Project]] at the [[National Library of Medicine]], but it would be several years before that data would become available.  Looking for other sources of high-resolution volume data of human anatomical structure, he came across the Carnegie Collection of Human Embryology,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last=Cohen | first=Jon | title=Embryo Development at the Click of a Mouse | journal=Science | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) | volume=297 | issue=5587 | date=September 6, 2002 | issn=0036-8075 | doi=10.1126/science.297.5587.1629 | pages=1629| pmid=12215620 | s2cid=32502255 }} &lt;/ref&gt; housed at the NMHM.  During a sabbatical working on methods for magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) in the laboratory of [[Paul Lauterbur]], 2003 [[Nobel Laureate]], Dr. Doyle created a plan for the VEP and worked with Dr. Noe to recruit a large group of prominent researchers to join as initial collaborators. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1=Doyle | first1=Michael D. | last2=Ang | first2=Cheong S. | last3=Martin | first3=David C. | last4=Noe | first4=Adrianne | title=The Visible Embryo Project: Embedded program objects for knowledge access, creation and management through the World Wide Web | journal=Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=20 | issue=6 | year=1996 | issn=0895-6111 | doi=10.1016/s0895-6111(96)00040-7 | pages=423–431| pmid=9007210 }} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://netlab.gmu.edu/visembryo/VEFinalReport.pdf Final Report Contract N01-LM-0-3508 Human Embryology Digital Library and Collaboratory Support Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==

Much of the early work involved creating serial section reconstructions from microscope slides, extracting volumetric data from the NMHM specimens, rather than just surface data. Sets of serial microscopic cross-sections through human embryos (prepared by Carnegie Collection contributors between the 1890s and 1970s) were used as sample image data around which to design and implement various components of the system. These images were digitized and processed to create 3D voxel datasets representing embryonic anatomy. Standard techniques for 3D volume visualization could then be applied to these data. &lt;ref name="processing" /&gt; &lt;ref name="modeling" /&gt;  Image processing of these data was required to correct for certain artifacts that were found in the original microscope sections from routine histological techniques of tissue preparation.

Later activities of the project would make use of MRM datasets acquired from the NMHM collection, ultra-high resolution histology images,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1=Doyle | first1=Michael D. | last2=Harrod | first2=Kimberly R. | title=Netlab: A platform for crowdsourcing virtual microscopy knowledge | journal=The FASEB Journal | publisher=Wiley | volume=32 | issue=S1 | year=2018 | issn=0892-6638 | doi=10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.635.20| s2cid=249782566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and three-dimensional adult image data acquired via the [[Visible Human Project]], in addition to embryo data.

==Collaborations==

The VEP became a far-reaching collaborative research program involving a large number of eminent scientists across the nation and around the world, including, among many others, Michael Doyle, of UIC, then UCSF, and project founder, Adrianne Noe, Director of the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]], [[George Washington University]]'s [[Robert Ledley]], inventor of the [[Full-body CT scan|Full-Body CT scanner]], [[UIUC]]'s [[Paul Lauterbur]], [[MRI]] pioneer and [[Nobel laureate]], [[LSU]]'s Ray Gasser, eminent embryologist, [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]]'s Kent Thornburg, internationally renown developmental biologist, Regan Moore, Director of the DICE group at the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]], William Lennon of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], Ingrid Carlbom of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s Cambridge Research Lab, and [[Demetri Terzopoulos]] of the [[University of Toronto]].

Some notable Visible Embryo Project collaborations include:

* Muritech

In the mid-1990s, Michael Doyle collaborated with [[Harvard]]'s Betsey Williams to create an internet atlas of mouse development, in a project named "Muritech."  A prototype two- and three-dimensional color atlas of mouse development was developed, using two embryos, a 13.5 d normal mouse embryo and a PATCH mutant embryo of the same age. Serial sections of the embryos, with an external registration marker system, introduced into the paraffin embedding process, were prepared by standard histological methods. For the 2D atlas, color images were digitized from 100 consecutive sections of the normal embryo. For the 3D atlas, 300 gray scale images digitized from the mutant embryo were conformally warped and reconstructed into a 3D volume dataset. The external fiducial system facilitated the three-dimensional reconstruction by providing accurate registration of consecutive images and also allowed for precise spatial calibration and the correction for warping artifacts. The atlases, with their associated anatomical knowledge base, were then integrated into a multimedia on-line information resource via the VEP's Web technology to provide research biologists with a set of advanced tools to analyze normal and abnormal murine embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1=Williams | first1=Betsey S. | last2=Doyle | first2=Michael D. | title=An internet atlas of mouse development | journal=Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=20 | issue=6 | year=1996 | issn=0895-6111 | doi=10.1016/s0895-6111(96)00041-9 | pages=433–447| pmid=9007211 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

* Next Generation Internet Contract

The Human Embryology Digital Library and Collaboratory Support Tools project was begun in 1999 as a demonstration of the biomedical application potential of the Next Generation Internet (NGI). The collaborators included eight organizations at sites around the continental USA, a mix of medical and information technology organizations, including [[George Mason University]], [[Eolas]], the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]],the  [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]], the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]], and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. The project undertook three major applications, based on the Carnegie Collection of Embryos at the AFIP's [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]] Human Development Anatomy Center (HDAC), a collection of cellular-level tissue slides that is one of the world's largest repositories of human embryos.  

These applications included:

1. Digitization, curation and annotation of embryo data: The VEP team created a production digitization capability, using automated digital microscopy, with data automatically registered for tiling and transmitted to the repository at the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]], and annotated by teams of biomedical volunteers with expert-level quality control.  

2. Distributed embryology education using materials derived from the Carnegie Collection to create animations of embryo development and recorded master classes that can be streamed over the Internet or downloaded to create a portable electronic classroom.  

3. Clinical management planning where medical professionals and expectant parent patients can review normal and abnormal development patterns with collaborative consultation from distant experts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://netlab.gmu.edu/visembryo/VEFinalReport.pdf Final Report Contract N01-LM-0-3508 Human Embryology Digital Library and Collaboratory Support Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;

* AnatLab
  
In order to enable new ways to interactively explore the VEP's massive volume datasets, Michael Doyle created the zMap system, using the [[Visible Human Project]] image data for the first prototype.  In 2011, Doyle collaborated with Steven Landers, Maurice Pescitelli, and others to use zMap to create an interactive tool that allows the user to select desired sets of anatomical structures for automated generation of 3D [[Quicktime VR]] visualizations. The system used the resources available in the Eolas AnatLab knowledgebase, which has over 2200 structures identified involving a total of over 4600 sections and 700,000 annotations overall, to access the anatomical structure surface information for individual structures. This surface information was then used to automatically extract the contained volumetric image data and convert the data into a format compatible with the Osirix volume imaging system. Automated scripts then controlled Osirix in the creation of a 3D visualization of the group of selected anatomical structures. Photorealistic results were obtained by using the original color voxel information from the original [[Visible Human Project | Visible Human]] cryosection images to color the surface of the 3D reconstruction. The system then automatically progressed through a pre-defined set of rotations to generate the set of image frames required to create a [[Quicktime VR]] (QTVR) interactive movie. This system thereby allowed an anatomy instructor to quickly and easily generate customized interactive 3D reconstructions for use in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  url=https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.495.2 | title= Automated system for on-demand generation of photorealistic structure-specific interactive anatomical reconstructions | journal=The FASEB Journal | publisher=Wiley | volume=25 | issue=S1 | year=2011 | last1=Pescitelli | first1=MJ | last2=Huntley | first2=S | last3=Theiss | first3=E | last4=Lilagan | first4=C | last5=Doyle | first5=MD | doi= 10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.495.2 | doi-broken-date= August 3, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==

Over the decades since it was begun, the work done in the Visible Embryo Project has led to the development of several important technology breakthroughs that have had worldwide impact:

* [[Spatial transcriptomics|Spatial Transcriptomics]]

Even though spatial mapping of Omics data had been described as an initial goal of the VEP, it wasn't until 1999 that four VEP collaborators, Michael Doyle, George Michaels, Maurice Pescitelli and Betsey Williams worked together to create a system for what they called "spatial genomics."&lt;ref name="patent7613571"/&gt; Today, this technology is known as [[Spatial transcriptomics]]. As their 2001 U.S. patent application states,&lt;ref name="patent7613571"/&gt; their system solved the need "to gather [[gene expression]] data in a manner that supports the type of exploratory research that can take advantage of the broad-spectrum types of biologic activity analysis enabled by today's [[microarray]] tools," as well as the need for "technology to allow the collection of large volumes of these types of data, to enable exploratory investigations into patterns of biologic activity ... to correlate gene expression data with morphological structure in a useful and easy to understand manner, such as in a [[Scientific visualization | volume visualization]] environment ... to allow the collection of larger volumes of [[gene expression]] data across a wider spectrum of [[gene]] types than ever before."

They named their system SAGA, short for Spatial Analysis of Genomic Activity.  As described in the related U.S. patents, 7,613,571,&lt;ref name="patent7613571"/&gt; 7,894,997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=7894997|pubdate=2011-02-22|inventor1-last=Doyle|inventor1-first=Michael D.|inventor2-last=Pescitelli, Jr.|inventor2-first=Maurice J.|inventor3-last=Williams|inventor3-first=Betsey S.|inventor4-last=Michaels|inventor4-first=George S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10,011,864,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=10011864|pubdate=2018-07-03|assign=Eolas Technologies Inc.|inventor1-last=Doyle|inventor1-first=Michael D.|inventor2-last=Pescitelli, Jr.|inventor2-first=Maurice J.|inventor3-last=Williams|inventor3-first=Betsey S.|inventor4-last=Michaels|inventor4-first=George S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SAGA system enabled the multidimensional morphological reconstruction of tissue biologic activity and "makes it possible for biological tissue specimens to be imaged in multiple dimensions to allow morphological reconstruction. The same tissue specimen is physically sampled in a regular raster array, so that tissue samples are taken in a regular multidimensional matrix pattern across each of the dimensions of the tissue specimen. Each sample is isolated and coded so it can be later correlated to the specific multidimensional raster array coordinates, thereby providing a correlation with the sample's original pre-sampling morphological location in the tissue specimen. Each tissue sample is then analyzed with broad-spectrum biological activity methods, providing information on a multitude of biologic functional characteristics [mRNA, etc.] for that sample. The resultant raster-based biological characteristic data may then be spatially mapped into the original multidimensional morphological matrix of image data. ... various types of analysis may then be performed on the resultant correlated multidimensional spatial datasets."  

[[Spatial transcriptomics]] was named the "Method of the Year for 2020" by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', in January 2021.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last=Marx | first=Vivien | title=Method of the Year: spatially resolved transcriptomics | journal=Nature Methods | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=18 | issue=1 | year=2021 | issn=1548-7091 | doi=10.1038/s41592-020-01033-y | pages=9–14| pmid=33408395 | s2cid=230817551 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Cloud computing|The cloud]]

In 1993, Dr. Doyle became the Director of the [[UCSF Medical Center|UCSF]] Center for Knowledge Management (CKM).  To create the underlying software and hardware that would provide the needed computational power for the VEP,  Doyle's CKM group designed a new paradigm for performing remote client-server volume visualization over the Internet.&lt;ref name="embedding"/&gt; This involved creating a system for remotely computing visualizations through a networked cluster, or cloud, of distributed heterogeneous computational engines, and coordinating the computations to pass user interface control messages to those engines, causing the cloud computers to generate new rendered visualizations and stream the resulting views to the users' desktops, while delta-encoding and compressing the streamed data to optimize performance over low-bandwidth connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/951087.951095 | title= Integrated control of distributed volume visualization through the World-Wide-Web | journal=VIS '94: Proceedings of the Conference on Visualization | publisher=IEEE | year=1994 | pages=13–20 | last1=Ang | first1=Cheong | last2=Martin | first2=David | last3=Doyle | first3=Michael| doi= 10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346342 | isbn= 9780780325210 | s2cid= 2598102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To hide the complexity of the system from the user, they modified one of the earliest versions of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic Web browser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What's New With NCSA Mosaic | website=Index of / | date=October 20, 1994 | url=http://www.kitchencloset.com/realstuff/ncsa/whats_new-archive/1994/whats-new-9410.html | ref={{sfnref | Index of / | 1994}} | access-date=March 6, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow their interactive cloud-computing applications to be automatically launched and run embedded within Web pages, so any user would need only to load a Web document from the VEP, and would be able to immediately interactively explore the project's multidimensional datasets, rather than static representations of those datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0895-6111(96)00040-7 | title= The Visible Embryo Project: Embedded program objects for knowledge access, creation and management through the World Wide Web| year= 1996| last1= Doyle| first1= Michael D.| last2= Ang| first2= Cheong S.| last3= Martin| first3= David C.| last4= Noe| first4= Adrianne| journal= Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics| volume= 20| issue= 6| pages= 423–431| pmid= 9007210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1993, the CKM's VEP research group demonstrated this system, the first [[Cloud computing|Web-based Cloud application platform]], on-stage to a meeting of approximately 300 Bay Area SIGWEB members at Xerox PARC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eolas.com/img/6-1-SIG-Web11-93.pdf Announcement: Second SIG-Web meeting (Palo Alto, CA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, this capability is called "[[Cloud computing|the Cloud]]." The VEP team's work opened the door on the potential of the Web to provide rich information resources to users, regardless of where they were located, and spawned a multi-trillion dollar industry as a result.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent |country=US |number=9195507 |title=Distributed hypermedia method and system for automatically invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a hypermedia document |gdate=2015-11-24 |invent1=MD Doyle |invent2=DC Martin |invent3=CS Ang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Image map|zMap]]

Dr. Doyle then began to focus more directly on the problem of how to navigate within these complex biomedical volume datasets, and developed a system for mapping the semantic identity of morphological structures within the datasets and integrating those mappings with the hypermedia linking mechanism of the Web. This led to the creation of the first three-dimensional Web [[image map]] system, and was used to create a variety of online interactive reference systems for biomedical education and research throughout the 90s and beyond.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite conference | last1=Doyle | first1=Mike | last2=Klein | first2=G. | last3=Hussaini | first3=F. | last4=Pescitelli | first4=M. | editor-last=Oliver | editor-first=William R. | title=MultiVIS: a web-based interactive remote visualization environment and navigable volume imagemap system  | publisher=SPIE | date=May 5, 2000 | issn=0277-786X | doi=10.1117/12.384871}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7792862 |title=Method and apparatus for identifying features of multidimensional image data in hypermedia systems |gdate=2010-09-07 |inventor=MD Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Blockchain]]

One of the challenges for large collaborative knowledge bases is how to assure the integrity of data over a long period of time.  Standard cryptographic methods that depend upon trusting a central validation authority are vulnerable to a variety of factors that can lead to data corruption, including hacking, data breaches, insider fraud, and the possible disappearance of the validating authority itself.  In order to solve this problem for the VEP data collections, Dr. Doyle created a novel type of cryptographic system, called [[Transient-key cryptography]].  This system allows the validation of data integrity without requiring users of the system to trust any central authority, and also represented the first [[Blockchain|forward-signature-blockchain]] system, enabling the later creation of the [[Bitcoin]] system.  In the mid-2000s, this technology was adopted as a national standard in the [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]] for [[Trusted timestamping|trusted timestamps]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent |country=US |number=6381696 |title=Method and system for transient key digital time stamps |gdate=2002-04-30 |inventor=MD Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7047415 |title=System and method for widely witnessed proof of time |gdate=2006-05-16 |invent1=MD Doyle |invent2=PF Doyle |invent3=GW Bernsohn |invent4=JD Roberts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Virtual assistant]]s

Since the mid 2000s, the VEP team has made great use of digital voice and text communications systems, to facilitate communications among the geographically-distributed team members.  In order to increase the efficiency of these communications, Michael Doyle and Steve Landers collaborated to create the Skybot system, the first AI-based mobile [[virtual assistant]] system.  Skybot used the power and flexibility of AI to dramatically expand the usefulness of messaging systems. Using Skybot, one could create a variety of programmable responses to incoming calls and chat messages. The system incorporated a state machine which could be configured to automatically trigger automated responses to various communication and user-context events. This provided the user with a surprisingly-broad and powerful set of capabilities for automating mobile communication operations, and pioneered the mobile [[Virtual assistant|intelligent-assistant]] product category that is now ubiquitous worldwide.

==Current status==

Plans are underway to secure the funding necessary to expand the Visible Embryo Project to create a national resource that combines a large-scale knowledgebase with advanced analytical tools in an innovative online collaborative environment to support and continue to advance the art and science of Spatial Omics.

      <text bytes="7379" xml:space="preserve">'''Vital heat''', also called '''innate''' or '''natural heat''', or '''''calidum innatum''''', is a term in [[Ancient Greek medicine]] and [[philosophy]] that has generally referred to the heat produced within the body, usually the heat produced by the [[heart]] and the [[circulatory system]].  Vital heat was a somewhat controversial subject because it was formerly believed that heat was acquired by an outside source such as the element of fire.
[[File:Gray491.png|thumb|right|The human heart, thought to be the source of vital heat]]

==Origin of concept==

It was a previously accepted concept that heat was absorbed through external sources, however the concept of vital heat was more or less stumbled upon by a physiological observation that associates cold with the dead and heat with the living.  "For the concept of vital heat we may--somewhat arbitrarily-- take our starting point in Parmenides.  His correlation of dead with cold, alive with warm, may not have been primarily intended as a contribution to physiology, yet the physiological significance of this thought was perceived by his successors; witness Empedocles, who taught 'sleep comes about when the heat of the blood is cooled to the proper degree, death when it becomes altogether cold'".&lt;ref name=Solsmen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solsmen|first=Friedrich|title=The Vital Heat, The Inborn Pneuma, and the Aether|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|year=1957|volume=77|issue=Part 1|pages=119–123|jstor=628643 |doi=10.2307/628643}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle would eventually modify this doctrine stating that "sleep is a temporary overpowering of the inner heat by other factors in the body, death its final extinction."&lt;ref name="Solsmen"/&gt;

==Vital heat and ancient medicine==
[[File:Ancientgreek surgical.jpg|thumb|Tools of Ancient Greek medicine]]
According to [[Ancient Greek]] physicians, vital heat was produced by the [[heart]], maintained by the ''[[pneuma]]'' (air, breath, spirit or [[soul]]), and circulated throughout the body by blood vessels, which were thought to be intact tubes using blood to transmit heat. [[Aristotle]] supported this argument by showing that when the heart is made cold compared to other organs, the individual dies. He believed that the heat produced in the heart caused blood to react in a similar way to boiling, expanding out through the blood vessels with every beat. This extreme heat, according to him, can lead to a [[spontaneous human combustion|self-consuming flame]] if it is not cooled by air from the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, Peter. ''The Rise of Experimental Biology''. Humana Press. 2002. {{ISBN|0-89603-835-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galen]] wrote in ''On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body'' (170): "The heart is, as it were, the hearthstone and source of the innate heat by which the animal is governed." In the 11th century, [[Avicenna]] agreed with this notion, stating that the heart produced [[breath]], the "vital power or innate heat" within the body, in his ''Canon of Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;Findlen, Paula.

Later, the term ''innate heat'' was attributed to friction caused by the motion of blood through arteries, as evidenced by the ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728):

:"For 'tis hence we know, that this ''innate Heat'' is no more than the Attrition of the Parts of the Blood; occasion'd by its circulatory Motion, especially in the Arteries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1728 |author=Chambers, Ephraim |url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0293&amp;q1=Attrition%20of%20the%20Parts%20of%20the%20Blood |title=Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences  |access-date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle's views==
Aristotle believed that the source of vital heat lies in the heart and is intimately connected to the soul. "This link is not for Aristotle simply an accidental connection, but rather the existence of vital heat is necessitated by the most basic living activity: [[nutrition]]. In De anima ii 4.416b28-29, Aristotle says: 'All food must be capable of being digested, and that whose activity causes [[digestion]] is heat. For this reason, every animate thing has heat.'".&lt;ref name=Studtmann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Studtmann|first=Paul|title=Living Capacities and Vital Heat in Aristotle|journal=Ancient Philosophy|year=2004|volume=24|issue=2|pages=365–379|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/authorizedshow?id=ancientphil_2004_0024_0002_0365_0380&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;page=1|access-date=23 March 2014|doi=10.5840/ancientphil200424247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although prominent scholars like Aristotle accepted this concept of innate heat and its role in digestion, there were others who were skeptical and retained a different point of view.  "However, if we look for antecedents of Aristotle's theories, the most important are probably to found in the ''Timaeus''.  Here Plato shows in some detail how in respiration the 'Hot' in us is cooled by the air which enters from outside, and he relies on the cutting power of the fire, which here is identical to the 'Hot', to explain the process of digestion &lt;ref name="Solsmen"/&gt;

[[File:52-aspetti di vita quotidiana, amore,Taccuino Sanitatis, Cas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]] believed that vital heat played a vital role in reproduction.]]
Along with his theory of the role of vital heat in nutrition and digestion, Aristotle believed that vital heat played a role in reproduction which includes several physical parts of the body different from the parts that participate in nutrition. Aristotle believed that blood was created through the process of digestion via vital heat and then pushed to the extremities of the body. However, blood is not in its final form but is transformed to a final substance to be used for the nourishment of the body. "Aristotle holds that semen is nutriment in its final stage of concoction before it becomes part of the body. Hence, blood, before it turns into flesh, bones, etc., first turns into semen."&lt;ref name=Studtmann /&gt;  Although blood is not in its final form, it can still be used to nourish the body and create flesh and bone. "Young males do not have semen because the conversion into flesh and bone must be done quickly owing to their rapid growth. And women do not have semen because they are not as hot as men and so lack the power of concocting blood into semen."&lt;ref name=Studtmann /&gt;  Blood in women is then naturally used to explain the [[menses]].  Therefore, when a male and female copulate and semen is emitted in the woman, the menses and the semen mix and begin a process that creates a new organism. "That it is the heat of the semen that gives it the power to concoct the menses is shown, according to Aristotle by the fact that in some insects which do not produce semen the female inserts a part of her body into the male which then is acted upon by the heat of the male".&lt;ref name=Studtmann /&gt;

'''Vitalism''' is a belief that starts from the premise that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things."&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Williamson, Robert C. |year=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=E.

In the 18th and 19th centuries vitalism was [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|discussed among biologists]], between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Vitalist biologists such as [[Johannes Reinke]] proposed [[testable]] [[hypotheses]] meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but their experiments failed to provide support for vitalism.

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jidenu, Paulin (1996) ''African Philosophy, 2nd Ed.'' Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-21096-8}}, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek philosophy]], the [[Milesian school]] proposed natural explanations [[deductive argument|deduced]] from [[materialism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. However, by the time of [[Lucretius]], this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable ''[[clinamen]]'' of [[Epicurus]]), and in [[Stoic physics]], the ''[[pneuma]]'' assumed the role of ''[[logos]]''. [[Galen]] believed the lungs draw ''pneuma'' from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birch|Cobb|1985|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of ''pneuma'', helping to shape later [[aether theories]].

===Early modern===
Vitalists included English anatomist [[Francis Glisson]] (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"&gt;{{harvnb|Birch|Cobb|1985|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in [[embryology]], that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his ''[[Theoria Generationis]]'' (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a ''vis essentialis'' (an organizing, formative force), stating "All believers in epigenesis are vitalists." [[Carl Reichenbach]] (1788–1869) later developed the theory of [[Odic force]], a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

In the 17th century, modern science responded to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[action at a distance]] and the mechanism of [[Cartesian dualism]] with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called "organic" matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking).&lt;ref name=Ede/&gt;

As worded by [[Charles Birch]] and [[John B. Cobb]], "the claims of the vitalists came to the fore again" in the 18th century:&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"/&gt; "[[Georg Ernst Stahl]]'s followers were active as were others, such as the physician genius [[Xavier Bichat|Francis Xavier Bichat]] of the Hotel Dieu."&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"/&gt; However, "Bichat moved from the tendency typical of the French vitalistic tradition to progressively free himself from [[metaphysics]] in order to combine with hypotheses and theories which accorded to the scientific criteria of physics and chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|''History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences''|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] recognised "a 'living principle' in addition to mechanics."&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"/&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of ''Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte''. Blumenbach cut up freshwater ''[[Hydra (zoology)|Hydra]]'' and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a "formative drive" (''Bildungstrieb'') in living matter. But he pointed out that this name,
{{blockquote|like names applied to every other kind of vital power, of itself, explains nothing: it serves merely to designate a peculiar power formed by the combination of the mechanical principle with that which is susceptible of modification.}}

===19th century===

[[File:Sample of Urea.jpg|thumb|right|The synthesis of [[urea]] in the early 19th century from [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic compounds]] was [[counterevidence]] for the vitalist hypothesis that only organisms could make the components of living things.]]

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], one of the early 19th century founders of modern [[chemistry]], argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.&lt;ref name=Ede&gt;Ede, Andrew. (2007) ''The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900–1935: The Neglected Dimension'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Berzelius contended that compounds could be distinguished by whether they required any organisms in their [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] ([[organic compounds]]) or whether they did not ([[inorganic compounds]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Ian|date=10 June 2002|title=History of Clinical Chemistry|journal=EJIFCC|volume=13|issue=4|pages=114–118|issn=1650-3414|pmc=6208063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but [[Friedrich Wöhler]] synthesised [[urea]] from inorganic components in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/13463|title=Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea|first1=E.|last1=Kinne-Saffran|first2=R.

This ''Wöhler Myth'', as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, "ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioethicsjournal.com/|title=Penn Bioethics Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf|title=Joachim Schummer, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1845, [[Adolph Kolbe]] succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, Wöhler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1833 and 1844, [[Johannes Peter Müller]] wrote a book on [[physiology]] called ''Handbuch der Physiologie'', which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a [[soul]] makes each organism an indivisible whole. He claimed that the behaviour of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Louis Pasteur]] argued that only life could catalyse [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) after his famous rebuttal of [[spontaneous generation]], performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur "fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena." Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, [[Liebig]], [[Moritz Traube|Traube]] and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a "vital action".&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;

===20th century===

[[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.&lt;ref name="DevBio"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031180529/http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110|url-status=dead|title=Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction|archivedate=October 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult.

Other vitalists included [[Johannes Reinke]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]]. Reinke used the word ''neovitalism'' to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6789277|title=Jung's concept of die Dominanten (the Dominants) (1997)|first=Richard|last=Noll|via=www.academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Scott Haldane]] adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an [[idealist]] philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that [[teleology]] was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book ''Mechanism, life and personality'' in 1913.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: "we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity", "every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience".&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168" /&gt; The work of Haldane was an influence on [[organicism]]. Haldane stated that a purely mechanist interpretation could not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref name="Mark A.

But so far as I know, there are no vitalists among the philosophers of biology who started publishing after 1965.

Portmann) are no longer alive. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3ycvNfa320C&amp;pg=PA93 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9781139488655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary science and engineering sometimes describe [[emergence|emergent processes]], in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schultz |first=S.G. |title=A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |volume=274 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=C13–23 |year=1998 |pmid=9458708 |doi=10.1152/ajpcell.1998.274.1.C13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert |first1=S.F. |last2=Sarkar |first2=S. |title=Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century |journal=Developmental Dynamics |volume=219 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10974666 |doi=10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are important for the behavior of the system.

Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism.

{{quote|On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status.

== Mesmerism ==
{{main|Animal magnetism}}
[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Mesmer]] proposed the vitalist force of ''[[animal magnetism|magnétisme animal]]'' in animals with breath.]]

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was "[[animal magnetism]]", in the theories of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magnétisme animal''' can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to, at that time, as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word "''animal''," for its root meaning (from Latin ''animus''="breath") specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans '''and''' animals.

Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King [[Louis XVI]] of France appointed two commissions to investigate [[mesmerism]]; one was led by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the other, led by [[Benjamin Franklin]], included [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]] and [[Lavoisier]]. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and [[trance]]s. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been "mesmerized"; he hugged each in turn to receive the "vital fluid," but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a "sensitive" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that "the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Best |first1=M. |last2=Neuhauser |first2=D. |last3=Slavin |first3=L. |title=Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped |url= http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/12/3/232 |journal=Quality &amp; Safety in Health Care |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=232–3 |year=2003 |pmid=12792017 |pmc=1743715 |doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical philosophies ==

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by [[Hippocrates]], these vital forces were associated with the [[four temperaments]] and [[The four humours|humours]]; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of [[qi]] or [[prana]]. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] concept of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Today forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as tenets in some religious traditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Complementary and alternative medicine]] therapies include [[energy therapy|energy therapies]],&lt;ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |access-date=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as [[therapeutic touch]], [[Reiki]], external [[qi]], [[chakra]] healing and SHEN therapy.&lt;ref name="Rubik"&gt;Rubik, ''Bioenergetic Medicines'', American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, {{cite web |url= http://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060214125248/https://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |archive-date=2006-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these therapies, the "[[subtle energy]]" field of a patient is manipulated by a practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a "complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...."&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt;

The founder of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Criticism ==
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The 17th century French playwright [[Molière]] mocked vitalism in his 1673 play ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]''.]]

Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as [[begging the question]] by inventing a name. [[Molière]] had famously parodied this fallacy in ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its '''dormitive virtue''' (i.e., [[soporific]] power)."&lt;ref name="fr.wikisource.org"&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its "aquosity".&lt;ref name="The Physical Basis of Life"&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/PMG/PBofL.html The Physical Basis of Life], ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 1869&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Julian Huxley]] in 1926 compared "vital force" or ''élan vital'' to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive force").

Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for [[organic chemistry]] and [[developmental biology]], but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, [[Jacques Loeb]] published ''The Mechanistic Conception of Life'', in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as [[Bertrand Russell]] put it (''Religion and Science''). He offered this challenge:

: "... we must either succeed in producing living matter artificially, or we must find the reasons why this is impossible." (pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6)

Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly:

: "It is, therefore, unwarranted to continue the statement that in addition to the acceleration of oxidations the beginning of individual life is determined by the entrance of a metaphysical "life principle" into the egg; and that death is determined, aside from the cessation of oxidations, by the departure of this "principle" from the body. In the case of the evaporation of water we are satisfied with the explanation given by the kinetic theory of gases and do not demand that to repeat a well-known jest of Huxley the disappearance of the "aquosity" be also taken into consideration." (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15)

Bechtel states that vitalism "is often viewed as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; For many scientists, "vitalist" theories were unsatisfactory "holding positions" on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]], stated "And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only [[Crank (person)|cranks]] will believe tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;Crick, Francis (1967) ''Of Molecules and Men''; Great Minds Series Prometheus Books 2004, reviewed [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/reviews/crickandkurtz.htm here]. Crick's remark is cited and discussed in: Hein H (2004) [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00413789 Molecular biology vs. organicism: The enduring dispute between mechanism and vitalism.] ''Synthese'' 20:238–253, who describes Crick's remark as "raising spectral red herrings".&lt;/ref&gt;

While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] retention of untested and [[Testability|untestable]] theories continues to this day. [[Alan Sokal]] published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of "scientific theories" of spiritual healing. (Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?).&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/pseudoscience_rev.pdf Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a technique called [[therapeutic touch]] was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, "nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism" and added that "Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time."&lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt;

Joseph C. Keating, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525203939/http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm|url-status=dead|title=Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD: Biographical sketch|archivedate=May 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses vitalism's past and present roles in [[chiropractic]] and calls vitalism "a form of [[bio-theology]]." He further explains that:

: "Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place. This circular reasoning offers pseudo-explanation, and may deceive us into believing we have explained some aspect of biology when in fact we have only labeled our ignorance. 'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests chiropractor Joseph Donahue, 'is absurd'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate"&gt;{{citation |title=The Meanings of Innate |author=Keating, Joseph C. |volume=46 |issue=1 |pmc=2505097 |journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |year=2002 |pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:

: "Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self-repair and auto-regulation of human physiology. But we surely stick out like a sore thumb among professions which claim to be scientifically based by our unrelenting commitment to vitalism. So long as we propound the 'One cause, one cure' rhetoric of Innate, we should expect to be met by ridicule from the wider health science community. Chiropractors can't have it both ways. Our theories cannot be both dogmatically held vitalistic constructs and be scientific at the same time. The purposiveness, consciousness and rigidity of the Palmers' Innate should be rejected."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

Keating also mentions Skinner's viewpoint:

: "Vitalism has many faces and has sprung up in many areas of scientific inquiry. Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]], for example, pointed out the irrationality of attributing behavior to mental states and traits. Such 'mental way stations,' he argued, amount to excess theoretical baggage which fails to advance cause-and-effect explanations by substituting an unfathomable psychology of 'mind'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

According to Williams, "[t]oday, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force."&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; "Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality."&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy|editor-first=William F.|editor-last=Williams|year=2013|edition=revised|title=Vitalism|page=367|isbn=9781135955229|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vH1EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395 |quote='''VITALISM''' &amp;ndash; The concept that bodily functions are due to a 'vital principle' or 'life force' that is distinct from the physical forces explainable by the laws of chemistry and physics.

The exact nature of the vital force was debated by early philosophers, but vitalism in one form or another remained the preferred thinking behind most science and medicine until 1828. That year, German scientist [[Friedrich Wöhler]] (1800&amp;ndash;82) synthesized an organic compound from an inorganic substance, a process that vitalists considered to be impossible. ... Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality. Today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the [[Energy (esotericism)|bioenergetic]] field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name=Stenger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=The Physics of 'Alternative Medicine': Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |volume=3 |issue=1 |url= http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |author-link=Victor_J_Stenger |access-date=2006-12-03 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061218144228/http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |archive-date=2006-12-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt; Joanne Stefanatos states that "The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics."&lt;ref name="Stefanatos"&gt;Stefanatos, J. 1997, ''Introduction to Bioenergetic Medicine'', Shoen, A.M. and S.G. Wynn, ''Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practices'', Mosby-Yearbook, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt; offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called "human energy fields".&lt;ref name="Biley"&gt;Biley, Francis C. 2005, ''Unitary Health Care: Martha Rogers' Science of Unitary Human Beings'', University of Wales College of Medicine, viewed 30 November 2006, {{cite web |url= http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |title=RogersHomepage |access-date=2006-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061205024515/http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |archive-date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt;

Vitalistic thinking has been identified in the naive biological theories of children: "Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.06.004 |last1=Inagaki |first1=K. |last2=Hatano |first2=G. |year=2004 |title='Vitalistic causality in young children's naive biology.' |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |volume=8 |issue=8|pages=356–62 |pmid=15335462 |s2cid=29256474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voice break''' generally refers to transitions between different [[vocal register]]s of the [[human voice]]. Although [[singing]] is mostly done using the [[modal voice|modal register]], it is important for more professional singers to be able to smoothly move between different vocal registers.

Professional singers refer to this break as the [[Passaggio]]. 

Unintentional voice breaks are called a voice crack.

Voice break may also refer to the deepening of the male voice during [[puberty]], known as the [[voice change]].

[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Embryology theories of [[Ernst Haeckel]] (following [[Johann Friedrich Meckel |Meckel]]) and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] compared. Von Baer denied any [[recapitulation theory |recapitulation]] of whole adult forms, though individual structures might be recapitulated.]]
'''Von Baer's laws of embryology''' (or '''laws of development''') are four rules proposed by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] to explain the observed pattern of [[Embryogenesis |embryonic development]] in different species.&lt;ref name=abz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abzhanov |first1=Arhat |title=von Baer's law for the ages: lost and found principles of developmental evolution |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=2013 |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=712–722 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.09.004 |pmid=24120296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Baer formulated the laws in the book ''Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere'' ("''On the Developmental History of Animals''"), published in 1828, while working at the [[University of Königsberg]]. He specifically intended to rebut [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s 1808 [[recapitulation theory]]. According to that theory, embryos pass through successive stages that represent the adult forms of less complex organisms in the course of development, and that ultimately reflects ''scala naturae'' (the [[great chain of being]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=John M. |last2=Schultka |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Göbbel |first3=Luminita |title=Meckel on developmental pathology |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |date=2006 |volume=140A |issue=2 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31043 |pmid=16353245 |s2cid=30513424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; von Baer believed that such linear development is impossible. He posited that instead of linear progression, embryos started from one or a few basic forms that are similar in different animals, and then developed in a branching pattern into increasingly different organisms. Defending his ideas, he was also opposed to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[Natural selection |common ancestry and descent with modification]], and particularly to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s revised recapitulation theory with its slogan "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garstang |first1=Walter |author-link=Walter Garstang |title=The Theory of Recapitulation: A Critical Re-statement of the Biogenetic Law |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=1922 |volume=35 |issue=232 |pages=81–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1922.tb00464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Løvtrup |first=Søren |author-link=Søren Løvtrup |title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1978 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=348–352 |doi=10.2307/2412887 |jstor=2412887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was however broadly supportive of von Baer's view of the relationship between embryology and evolution.

==The laws==

Von Baer described his laws in his book ''Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere. Beobachtung und Reflexion'' published in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Baer |first=Karl Ernst von |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6303 |title=Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere. Beobachtung und Reflexion |date=1828 |publisher=Bei den Gebrüdern Bornträger |location=Königsberg |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.6303}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a series of statements generally summarised into four points, as translated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in his ''Scientific Memoirs'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Thomas Henry |author-link=Thomas Huxley |editor1-last=Henfrey |editor1-first=Arthur |title=Scientific memoirs, selected from the transactions of foreign academies of science, and from foreign journals.

# The more general characters of a large group appear earlier in the embryo than the more special characters.
# From the most general forms the less general are developed, and so on, until finally the most special arises.
# Every embryo of a given animal form, instead of passing through the other forms, rather becomes separated from them.
# The embryo of a higher form never resembles any other form, but only its embryo.

==Description==

Von Baer discovered the [[blastula]] (the early hollow ball stage of an embryo) and the development of the [[notochord]] (the stiffening rod along the back of all [[chordate]]s, that forms after the blastula and [[gastrula]] stages). From his observations of these stages in different vertebrates, he realised that [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] must be wrong. For example, he noticed that the [[yolk sac]] is found in [[bird]]s, but not in [[frog]]s. According to the recapitulation theory, such structures should invariably be present in frogs because they were assumed to be at a lower level in the evolutionary tree. Von Baer concluded that while structures like the notochord are recapitulated during embryogenesis, whole organisms are not.&lt;ref name="matthen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthen |first1=Mohan |last2=Stephens |first2=Christopher |title=Philosophy of Biology |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-080-47124-2 |pages=444–445 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVww2ZPO258C}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that (as translated):

{{quote |The embryo successively adds the organs that characterize the animal classes in the ascending scale. When the human embryo, for instance, is but a simple vesicle, it is an infusorian; when it has gained a liver, it is a mussel; with the appearance of the osseous system, it enters the class of fishes; and so forth, until it becomes a mammal and then a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ospovat |first1=D. |title=The influence of Karl Ernst von Baer's embryology, 1828–1859: A reappraisal in light of Richard Owen's and William B.

In terms of taxonomic hierarchy, according to von Baer, characters in the embryo are formed in top-to-bottom sequence, first from those of the largest and oldest taxon, the [[phylum]], then in turn class, order, family, genus, and finally species.&lt;ref name="matthen"/&gt;

==Reception==

The laws received a mixed appreciation. While they were criticised in detail, they formed the foundation of modern [[embryology]].&lt;ref name=abz/&gt; 

===Charles Darwin===

The most important supporter of von Baer's laws was [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin came across von Baer's laws from the work of [[Johannes Peter Müller]] in 1842, and realised that it was a support for his own theory of [[Natural selection |descent with modification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Scott F. |author-link=Scott F. Gilbert |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10049/ |title=Developmental Biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2000 |isbn=978-0878932436 |pages=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was a critique of the recapitulation theory and agreed with von Baer that an adult animal is not reflected by an embryo of another animal, and only embryos of different animals appear similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Barnes |first=M. Elizabeth |date=2014 |title=Karl Ernst von Baer's Laws of Embryology |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/karl-ernst-von-baers-laws-embryology |access-date=2020-10-04 |website=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (first edition, 1859):

{{quote |[The] adult [animal] differs from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Darwin |title=On the Origin of Species |year=1859 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |page=338 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Darwin also said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the individual, which when mature become widely different and serve for different purposes, are in the embryo exactly alike. The embryos, also, of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar: a better proof of this cannot be given, than a circumstance mentioned by Agassiz, namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some vertebrate animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal, bird, or reptile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |title=On the Origin of Species |publisher=John Murray |year=1859 |location=London |pages=438–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Darwin's attribution to [[Louis Agassiz]] was a mistake,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rogers |first=James Allen |date=1973 |title=The Reception of Darwin's Origin of Species by Russian Scientists |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/351177 |journal=Isis |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=484–503 |doi=10.1086/351177 |jstor=229645|pmid=4593473 |s2cid=36129302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was corrected in the third edition as von Baer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F381&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 |title=The Origin of Species |publisher=John Murray |year=1861 |edition=3 |location=London |pages=470–471}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further explained in the later editions of ''Origin of Species'' (from third to sixth editions), and wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It might be thought that the amount of change which the various parts and organs [of vertebrates] undergo in their development from the embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of comparison; but there are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans, in which several parts of the structure become less perfect, so that the mature animal cannot be called higher than its larva. Von Baer's standard seems the most widely applicable and the best, namely, the amount of differentiation of the different parts (in the adult state, as I should be inclined to add) and their specialisation for different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |title=On the Origin of Species |publisher=John Murray |year=1861 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |title=The Origin of Species |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F401&amp;pageseq=1 |publisher=John Murray |year=1872 |edition=6 |location=London |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even so, von Baer was a vociferous anti-Darwinist, although he believed in the common ancestry of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dagg |first1=Joachim L. |last2=Derry |first2=J.

===Later biologists===

The British zoologist [[Adam Sedgwick (zoologist) |Adam Sedgwick]] studied the developing embryos of [[Squalus |dogfish]] and [[chicken]], and in 1894 noted a series of differences, such as the green yolk in the dogfish and yellow yolk in the chicken, absence of embryonic rim in chick embryos, absence of [[blastopore]] in dogfish, and differences in the gill slits and gill clefts. He concluded:

{{quote |There is no stage of development in which the unaided eye would fail to distinguish between them with ease... A blind man could distinguish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sedgwick |first1=Adam |author-link=Adam Sedgwick (zoologist) |title=Memoirs: On the Law of Development commonly known as von Baer's Law; and on the Significance of Ancestral Rudiments in Embryonic Development |journal=Journal of Cell Science |date=1894 |volume=s2-36 |issue=141 |pages=35–52 |doi=10.1242/jcs.s2-36.141.35 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s2-36/141/35|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern biologists still debate the validity of the laws. In one line of argument, it is said that although every detail of von Baer's law may not work, the basic assumption that early developmental stages of animals are highly conserved is a biological fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Garfield |first1=David A. |last2=Wray |first2=Gregory A. |date=2009 |title=Comparative embryology without a microscope: using genomic approaches to understand the evolution of development |journal=Journal of Biology |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=65 |doi=10.1186/jbiol161 |pmc=2736668 |pmid=19664180}}&lt;/ref&gt; But an opposition says that there are conserved genetic conditions in embryos, but not the genetic events that govern the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kalinka |first1=Alex T. |last2=Tomancak |first2=Pavel |date=2012 |title=The evolution of early animal embryos: conservation or divergence? |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22520868 |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=385–393 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.007 |issn=1872-8383 |pmid=22520868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example on the problem of von Baer's law is the formation of [[notochord]] before heart. This is due to the fact that heart is present in many invertebrates, which never have notochord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Løvtrup |first=Søren |author-link=Søren Løvtrup |date=1987 |title=Phylogenesis, ontogenesis and evolution |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11250008709355584 |journal=Italian Journal of Zoology |language=en |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=199–208 |doi=10.1080/11250008709355584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2015}}

'''Waru Waru''' is an [[Aymaran languages|Aymara]] term for the [[agriculture|agricultural]] technique developed by pre-Hispanic people in the Andes region of [[South America]] from Ecuador to Bolivia; this regional agricultural technique is also referred to as ''camellones'' in Spanish. Functionally similar agricultural techniques have been developed in other parts of the world, all of which fall under the broad category of [[raised field]] agriculture. 

This type of [[altiplano]] field agriculture consists of parallel canals alternated by raised planting beds, which would be strategically located on floodplains or near a water source so that the fields could be properly irrigated. These flooded fields were composed of soil that was rich in nutrients due to the presence of aquatic plants and other organic materials. Through the process of mounding up this soil to create planting beds, natural, recyclable fertilizer was made available in a region where nitrogen-rich soils were rare. &lt;ref&gt;Janusek, John W.; Kolata, Alan L. 2004. "Top-down or bottom-up: rural settlement and raised field agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia." ''Journal of Anthropological Archaeology'', Vol. 23, pg.409&lt;/ref&gt; By trapping solar radiation during the day, this raised field agricultural method also protected crops from freezing overnight. &lt;ref&gt;Janusek, John W.; Kolata, Alan L. 2004. "Top-down or bottom-up: rural settlement and raised field agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia." ''Journal of Anthropological Archaeology'', Vol. 23, pg.409&lt;/ref&gt; These raised planting beds were irrigated very efficiently by the adjacent canals which extended the growing season significantly, allowing for more food yield. Waru Waru were able to yield larger amounts of food than previous agricultural methods due to the overall efficiency of the system. 

This technique is dated to around 300 B.C., and is most commonly associated with the [[Tiwanaku]] culture of the [[Lake Titicaca]] region in southern Bolivia, who used this method to grow crops like [[potatoes]] and [[quinoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raised beds and waru waru cultivation |publisher=[[Organization of American States]], Department of Sustainable Development|url=http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea59e/ch27.htm |accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of agriculture also created artificial ecosystems, which attracted other food sources such as fish and lake birds. Past cultures in the Lake Titicaca region likely utilized these additional resources as a subsistence method. &lt;ref&gt; Erickson, Clark L. 1988 "Raised Field Agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Putting Ancient Agriculture Back to Work". ''Expedition'', Vol. 30, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  It combines [[raised bed gardening|raised bed]]s with [[irrigation]] channels to prevent damage by [[soil erosion]] during floods. These fields ensure both collecting of water (either [[fluvial]] water, rainwater or [[phreatic]] water) and subsequent drainage. The drainage aspect of this method makes it particularly useful in many areas subjected to risks of brutal floods, such as tropical parts of Bolivia and Peru where it emerged. Raised field agricultural methods have been used in many other countries such as China, Mexico and Belize. Mexican [[Chinampas]] were similar to Waru Waru in that they were created on or near a water source in order to properly irrigate crops. Raised fields are known in Belize from various sites, including [[Pulltrouser Swamp]].

== Modern Uses ==
In the 1960s, geographers [[William Denevan]], [[George Plafker]], and Kenneth Lee found evidence of raised-field agriculture that had been utilized in the [[Llanos de Moxos]] region of [[Bolivia]]'s [[Amazon basin]], a region that was previously thought to have been unable to sustain large-scale agriculture because of what was believed to have been an unfavorable [[rainforest]] environment. This discovery led to a joint [[experimental archaeology]] project in the region involving [[archaeologist]] [[Clark Erickson]], the [[Inter-American Foundation]], the Parroquia of San Ignacio, the Bolivian Institute of Archaeology, and the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. The goal of this experiment was to attempt to restore indigenous raised-field agriculture in the region. This project began in 1990 at the Biological Station of the [[Beni Department]] in Bolivia. Because of the experiment's success, it was later implemented further in collaboration with local indigenous communities. The indigenous community provided land for the project and the Inter-American Foundation paid them wages to build and maintain the plots, which successfully produced manioc and maize. These plots did not require extensive upkeep following the initial season's planting, and were self-sufficient because of the artificial ecosystems that they created.&lt;ref&gt; Erickson, Clark L. 1994 "Festival of American Folklife: Culture and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean" ''Smithsonian Institution'' https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cerickso/applied3.html &lt;/ref&gt;

This agricultural method was also revived by [[Alan Kolata]] of the [[University of Chicago]] in 1984, in [[Tiwanaku]], [[Bolivia]] as well as [[Puno]], [[Peru]]. Research on Waru Waru and its effectiveness in the past has led to a resurgence of the technique amongst contemporary [[Aymara language|Aymara]]- and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]-speaking native peoples in Bolivia and Peru. By utilizing this centuries-old technique, modern people in the region have been able to make use of the harsh [[altiplano]] landscape around [[Lake Titicaca]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/19/water-scarcity-drought-peru-kenya-india?CMP=twt_gu | title=The three wonders of the ancient world solving modern water problems In Peru, Kenya and India, NGOs are helping communities overcome water scarcity using wisdom from the past | work=The Guardian | date=19 August 2015 | accessdate=19 August 2015 |author1=Nivedita Khandekar |author2=Geoffrey Kamadi |author3=Dan Collyns }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is now being used in different areas of South America where farming is difficult, such as the altiplano and the Amazon basin. Because of this method, indigenous people are now able to farm the landscape much more efficiently and without the use of modern equipment. This method also allows for large-scale agriculture to be performed in the Amazon basin without having to rely on [[deforestation]].

=== Experiments ===
Research was done at two raised-field sites by Diego Sanchez de Lozada et al. in the northern altiplano of Bolivia near Lake Titicaca in an effort to better understand the effects of frost on [[potato]] crops. At an altitude of 3810 m, these crops were subject to temperature and moisture variation. Temperatures of the soil on top of the 50 cm high raised mounds was about 1 degree [[Celsius]] higher than the temperature of the ground in nearby fields, showing that the raised-field technique was able to partially mitigate frost effects on potato crops at night. Temperature and moisture analysis of the raised fields showed that the higher temperature present was due to above-ground processes, which caused cold air to fall to the canals and not on the planted rows. &lt;ref&gt; de Lozada, Diego Sanchez et al. 1998 "Heat and moisture dynamics in raised field systems of the lake Titicaca region (Bolivia)." ''Agricultural and Forest Meteorology'' Vol. 92, pg.251&lt;/ref&gt; The frost mitigation effects of the raised field system kept crops from freezing overnight, which increased crop yield.

== History ==
=== Lake Titicaca Region ===
16th Century Spanish accounts of the Lake Titicaca region mentioned the different types of agriculture utilized by the native peoples in detail, however there was never any mention of raised fields in their records. The lack of Spanish accounts strongly suggests that these Waru Waru were no longer in use by the time the [[conquistadors]] reached the Lake Titicaca region. 

The raised fields of the region are numerous and range in size, however they are generally 4-10 m wide, 10 to 100 m long, and 1 m tall. These pre-Hispanic fields cover about 82,000 hectares of land in Bolivia and Peru, and sit above an altitude of around 3,800 m. [[Radiocarbon]] dates taken from habitation sites associated with raised field agriculture in the region indicate usage sometimes between 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400. [[Thermoluminescence dating]] was also used to date pottery shards in associated areas, the results of which agree with the radiocarbon dates. Field [[stratigraphy]] was used to provide relative dates of the usage of certain raised fields in the area. The habitation sites in association with these fields indicate large populations and long-term occupations, suggesting that raised field agriculture was able to sustain large numbers of people.  These dates provided from Andean sites suggest that this form of agriculture was a relatively early phenomenon in the area that slowly expanded throughout the region, and was utilized by various cultures during different time periods. &lt;ref&gt; Erickson, Clark L. 1988 "Raised Field Agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Putting Ancient Agriculture Back to Work". ''Expedition'', Vol. 30, pg. 12 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Water-use efficiency (WUE)''' refers to the [[ratio]] of [[water]] used in [[plant metabolism]] to water lost by the [[plant (botanical)|plant]] through [[transpiration]]. Two types of water-use efficiency are referred to most frequently:

*[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] water-use efficiency (also called instantaneous water-use efficiency), which is defined as the ratio of the rate of [[carbon assimilation]] (photosynthesis) to the rate of transpiration, and
* water-use efficiency of productivity (also called integrated water-use efficiency), which is typically defined as the ratio of [[biomass]] produced to the rate of transpiration.

Increases in water-use efficiency are commonly cited as a response mechanism of plants to moderate to severe [[soil]] water deficits and have been the focus of many programs that seek to increase [[crop]] tolerance to [[drought]]. However, there is some question as to the benefit of increased water-use efficiency of plants in [[agricultural systems]], as the processes of increased yield production and decreased water loss due to transpiration (that is, the main driver of increases in water-use efficiency) are fundamentally opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, M. ''Water Use Efficiency in Plant Biology.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2004. {{ISBN|1-4051-1434-7}}. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If there existed a situation where water deficit induced lower transpirational rates without simultaneously decreasing photosynthetic rates and biomass production, then water-use efficiency would be both greatly improved and the desired trait in [[crop productivity|crop production]].

[[File:Forrester-Kangaroo-mob.jpg|thumb|Within Ng's framework of welfare biology, beings such as kangaroos who  have the capacity for perception and ability to experience pleasure or pain, are classified as "affective sentients"]]

'''Welfare biology''' is a proposed cross-disciplinary field of research to study the positive and negative well-being of [[sentient individuals]] in relation to their environment. [[Yew-Kwang Ng]] first advanced the field in 1995. Since then, its establishment has been advocated for by a number of writers, including philosophers, who have argued for the importance of creating the research field, particularly in relation to [[wild animal suffering]]. Some researchers have put forward examples of existing research that welfare biology could draw upon and suggested specific applications for the research's findings.

== History ==
Welfare biology was first proposed by the [[Welfare economics|welfare economist]] [[Yew-Kwang Ng]], in his 1995 paper "Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering". In the paper, Ng defines welfare biology as the "study of living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering)." He also distinguishes between "affective" and "non-affective" sentients, affective sentients being individuals with the capacity for perceiving the external world and experiencing pleasure or pain, while non-affective sentients have the capacity for perception, with no corresponding experience; Ng argues that because the latter experience no pleasure or suffering, "[t]heir welfare is necessarily zero, just like nonsentients".

Matthew Clarke and Ng, in 2006, used Ng's welfare biology framework to analyse the costs, benefits and welfare implications of the [[Culling wildlife|culling]] of kangaroos—classified as affective sentients—in [[Puckapunyal]], Australia. They concluded that while their discussion "may give some support to the culling of kangaroos or other animals in certain circumstances, a more preventive measure may be superior to the resort to culling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Matthew|last2=Ng|first2=Yew-Kwang|date=2006-10-01|title=Population Dynamics and Animal Welfare: Issues Raised by the Culling of Kangaroos in Puckapunyal|url=http://www.stafforini.com/library/clarke-2006.pdf|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|pages=407–422|doi=10.1007/s00355-006-0137-8|s2cid=15023392|issn=1432-217X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Thomas Eichner and Rüdiger Pethi analyzed Ng's model, raising concern regarding a lack of appropriate determinants of the welfare of organisms because of the infancy of welfare biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Eichner|first1=Thomas|last2=Pethig|first2=Rüdiger|date=January 2006|title=Efficient nonanthropocentric nature protection|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|volume=26|issue=1|pages=47–74|doi=10.1007/s00355-005-0029-3|jstor=41106720|s2cid=20637480|issn=0176-1714|url=https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/cesifo1_wp1262.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Ng argued that welfare biology could help resolve the paradox within [[animal welfare science]], first raised by [[Marian Dawkins]], on the difficulty of studying animal feelings, by answering "difficult questions regarding animal welfare"; in the paper, Ng also offered various practical proposals for improving the welfare of captive animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|date=2016-01-01|title=How welfare biology and commonsense may help to reduce animal suffering|url=https://animalstudiesrepository.org/animsent/vol1/iss7/1|journal=Animal Sentience|volume=1|issue=7|doi=10.51291/2377-7478.1012|issn=2377-7478}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd K. Shackelford]] and Sayma H. Chowdhury, in response to Ng, argued that rather than focusing on improving the welfare of captive animals, that it would be better to not breed them in the first place, as this would "eliminate their suffering altogether".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Sayma H.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|date=December 2017|title=To Breed or Not to Breed?: an Antinatalist Answer to the Question of Animal Welfare|url=https://www.toddkshackelford.com/downloads/Chowdhury-Shackelford-EPS-2017.pdf|journal=Evolutionary Psychological Science|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=390–391|doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0100-1|s2cid=151484048|issn=2198-9885}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ng published an update to his original 1995 paper, with Zach Groff, in 2019, which found an error in his original model, leading to a negation of the original conclusion and a revised conception of the extent of suffering in nature as less pessimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Groff|first1=Zach|last2=Ng|first2=Yew-Kwang|date=2019-06-18|title=Does suffering dominate enjoyment in the animal kingdom?

A chapter on welfare biology by the moral philosophers [[Catia Faria]] and [[Oscar Horta]] is included in the 2019 book ''The Routledge Handbook of Animal Ethics''. In the chapter, they argue that welfare biology could be partially developed from animal welfare science, but its focus would be broader because it wouldn't only focus on studying animals under human control. Faria and Horta also assert that welfare biology could be developed from [[ecology]], with a focus on how the well-being of sentient individuals is affected by their environments. They raise a concern of what they see as the minimization of the importance of animal well-being, caused by widespread speciesist and environmentalist beliefs among life scientists and the general public, which they argue could hamper the development of welfare biology. Faria and Horta conclude that the "expected value of developing welfare biology is extremely high" because of the massive extent of [[Wild animal suffering|animal suffering in the wild]], which refutes commonly conceived idyllic conceptions of nature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Faria|first1=Catia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGPBDwAAQBAJ|title=The Routledge Handbook of Animal Ethics|last2=Horta|first2=Oscar|publisher=Routledge|year=2019|isbn=978-1-315-10584-0|editor-last=Fischer|editor-first=Bob|location=New York|chapter=Welfare Biology|doi=10.4324/9781315105840-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have emphasised the importance of [[life history theory]] to welfare biology, as they argue certain traits of life history may predispose certain individuals to worse welfare outcomes and that this has a strong relationship with [[habitat fragmentation]] sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hecht|first1=Luke|last2=Allcock|first2=Matthew|date=2020-06-18|title=Potential effects of habitat fragmentation on wild animal welfare|url=https://ecoevorxiv.org/hb7nm/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=EcoEvoRxiv Preprints|doi=10.32942/osf.io/hb7nm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that while welfare biology, as a field in its infancy, lacks sufficient empirical studies on the welfare of wild animals, it can make up for this through the use of existing demographic data, currently used to inform [[biodiversity conservation]], to inform future research efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bioRxiv |biorxiv=10.1101/819565 |first=Luke B.B. |last=Hecht |title=Accounting for demography in the assessment of wild animal welfare |date=2019-10-28 &lt;!-- unsupported parameters |doi=10.1101/819565 |url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/819565v1.full.pdf --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the welfare implications of fire on wild animals has been cited as an example of using knowledge drawn from existing ecology studies to establish the field of welfare biology and identify future directions of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Jara|last2=Miguel|first2=Javier de|date=2020-08-28|title=Fires in Nature: A Review of the Challenges for Wild Animals|url=https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202008.0124/v2|journal=Preprints|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of welfare biology to [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] projects has additionally been a subject of investigation, with "collaboration between local people, conservationists, authorities and policymakers" suggested as a means of establishing welfare biology as a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Bernard|first=Laura|title=From Theory to Practice: the Implementation of Welfare Biology in Rewilding.

Researchers in [[environmental economics]] have drawn attention to Ng's claim in his original paper that the "time is ripe for the recognition of welfare biology as a valid field of scientific study", yet after 25 years, welfare biology as a field of research has yet to take off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Carlier|first1=Alexis|last2=Treich|first2=Nicolas|date=2020-04-07|title=Directly Valuing Animal Welfare in (Environmental) Economics|url=https://www.tse-fr.eu/sites/default/files/medias/doc/by/treich/valuing.pdf|journal=International Review of Environmental and Resource Economics|volume=14|issue=1|pages=113–152|doi=10.1561/101.00000115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal Ethics (organization)|Animal Ethics]] and [[Wild Animal Initiative]] are two organizations working on promoting the establishment of welfare biology as a field of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|date=2021-04-12|title=The wild frontier of animal welfare|url=https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22325435/animal-welfare-wild-animals-movement|access-date=2021-09-05|website=Vox|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed subdisciplines ==
=== Urban welfare ecology ===
[[File:Feral pigeon (Columba livia domestica), 2017-05-27.jpg|thumb|Urban welfare ecology has been proposed as a subdiscipline to study the welfare of [[Urban wildlife|animals in urban environments]], such as [[Feral pigeon|feral pigeons]]]]
Catia Faria and Oscar Horta have proposed urban welfare ecology as a subdiscipline of welfare biology, which would study the well-being of animals living in urban, suburban and industrial ecosystems. They suggest that much research has already been carried out on animals in these areas, but with the intention of eliminating their negative impact on humans, or to conserve animals of particular species. Faria and Horta argue that such knowledge can be applied to help mitigate the harms that these animals experience and that such environments are perfect for intervention experiments because such ecosystems are already greatly under human control and that the findings could be applied to improve the assessments of the well-being of animals in other ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Wells and Wellington affair''' was a dispute about the publication of three papers in the ''Australian Journal of Herpetology'' in 1983 and 1985. The periodical was established in 1981 as a [[academic peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] focusing on the study of [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s ([[herpetology]]). Its first two issues were published under the [[editor-in-chief|editorship]] of [[Richard W. Wells]], a first-year biology student at Australia's [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]]. Wells then ceased communicating with the journal's [[editorial board]] for two years before suddenly publishing three papers without peer review in the journal in 1983 and 1985. Coauthored by himself and high school teacher Cliff Ross Wellington, the papers reorganized the [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of all of Australia's and New Zealand's amphibians and reptiles and proposed over 700 changes to the [[binomial nomenclature]] of the region's [[:wikt:herpetofauna|herpetofauna]].

Members of the herpetological community reacted strongly to the pair's actions and eventually brought a case to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] to [[suppressed name|suppress]] the scientific names they had proposed. After four years of arguments, the commission opted not to vote on the case because it hinged largely on taxonomic arguments rather than nomenclatural ones, leaving some of Wells and Wellington's names [[available name|available]]. The case's outcome highlighted the vulnerability to the established rules of biological nomenclature that [[desktop publishing]] presented. As of 2020, 24 of the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific names]] assigned by Wells and Wellington remained valid [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Comparison between zoology and botany|senior synonyms]].

The ''Australian Journal of Herpetology'' was a [[scientific journal]] specialising in [[herpetology]]. Its publisher, the [[Sydney]]-based Australian Herpetologists' League, was established to facilitate the journal's production.&lt;ref name="monteith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monteith|first1=G.

In 1981, the Australian Herpetologists' League released the first and second issues of the first [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] of the ''Australian Journal of Herpetology''. They contained papers written both by professional and amateur researchers concerning a number of topics in Australian herpetology, including a description of a novel [[Pythonidae|python]] species, ''[[Morelia bredli|"Python" bredli]]''.&lt;ref name="monteith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gow |first1=G.

==Rationales and responses==
===Initial reactions===
Upon the release of "A Synopsis of the Class Reptilia in Australia", all three members of the ''Australian Journal of Herpetology''{{'}}s editorial board resigned. The trio wrote letters to the editor of the ''[[Herpetological Review]]'', a journal published by the international [[Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles]], to clarify that the ''Australian Journal of Herpetology'' was not affiliated with UNE past its second issue and that Wells and Wellington's papers had been self-published and had not undergone [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="monteith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kingmiller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heatwole" /&gt; Heatwole also encouraged authors whose papers had been accepted for future issues to send their work elsewhere, as Wells was unresponsive to calls to return their manuscripts to them.&lt;ref name="heatwole" /&gt;

British paleontologist [[Richard A. Thulborn|Tony Thulborn]] described reactions from professional herpetologists to the pair's actions as ranging "from disbelief to outrage".&lt;ref name="thulborn" /&gt; News of "A Synopsis of the Class Reptilia in Australia" and the fallout of its publication was reported throughout 1984 in several [[New South Wales]] newspapers, including the ''[[Illawarra Mercury]]'', the ''[[Blue Mountains Gazette]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''. The latter wrote that the events were "one of the most interesting scientific [[:wikt:bun fight|bun-fights]] in Australia's history".&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gans"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gans|first1=C.|title=Comment on two checklists|journal=[[Herpetological Review]]|volume=16|issue=1|issn=0018-084X|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/gjukl09bu24yd51/HR%201985.16.1R.pdf?dl=1|date=March 1985|pages=6–7|author-link=Carl Gans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells and Wellington's combined work put forth more than 700 changes to the [[binomial nomenclature]] of Australia's reptiles and amphibians, until this point believed to include around 900 species.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt; Herpetologists asserted that the duo had described species without providing adequate diagnostic characteristics and established new [[taxon|taxa]] without identifying or examining [[type (biology)|type species]].&lt;ref name="monteith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kingmiller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thulborn" /&gt; G. B. Monteith contended that the pair had named numerous species in trivial ways (including, for instance, naming a species after [[Darth Vader]]), and wrote that although Wells and Wellington had given some taxa names honouring working herpetologists, many of those namesakes supported suppressing the duo's work.&lt;ref name="monteith" /&gt; Gordon C. Grigg, president of the Australian Society of Herpetologists, and the evolutionary biologist and ecologist [[Richard Shine]] wrote in a letter to the ''Herpetological Review'' that "the effect of these [Wells and Wellington's] publications, if taken seriously, would be to destabilise permanently the nomenclature of the Australian herpetofauna."&lt;ref name="grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grigg|first1=G.

===Wells and Wellington's justifications===
Wells and Wellington, the latter a teacher at [[Blaxland High School]], said that they did "years of research" before publishing their first paper.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=G.|title=Reptiles score a new status, but on rocky ground|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=20 October 1984|pages=8–9|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/122587366|issn=0312-6315|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington claimed in 1984 that their work was self-published due to a dispute with the [[Australian Museum]], to which the pair had donated several specimens.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; Nonetheless, he said that the museum had prevented him and Wells from using its reptile collections for their research, further saying that,
{{blockquote|"It became obvious to us that there were people in the know who were keeping a lot of things to themselves [...] Our studies showed that there were many animals which were very distinctive and should have full specific status. Because some scientists were suppressing this for their own ends, these animals were suffering. How can you talk about conserving animals when you don't even know they exist?"&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt;}}
Relative to other continents, Australia's herpetofauna had been subject to less in-depth research, primarily due to the continent's low population density, uneven population distribution, and high biodiversity.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; Monteith described the duo's justification for their papers as "a radical conservation ethic" and wrote that their intent appeared to be based on the belief that describing individual [[population]]s as distinct species would hasten efforts for their conservation.&lt;ref name="monteith" /&gt; Wells and Wellington said in the introduction to their first paper that they hoped their work would be taken "not as anarchistic taxonomic vandalism, but as a decisive step intended to stir others into action".&lt;ref name="ww1983" /&gt; They intended to encourage others to generate research either to ratify their conclusions or counter them, either way putting out material to further understanding of reptile and amphibian life in the region.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

===ICZN case 2531===
Binomial nomenclature, the widely used system of identifying distinct species through two-part Latin names, is related to and distinct from the study of taxonomy, the [[Species description|description]] and arrangement of these different taxa in relationship to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Queiroz |first1=K. |title=The PhyloCode and the distinction between taxonomy and nomenclature |journal=[[Systematic Biology]] |date=2006 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=160–162 |doi=10.1080/10635150500431221|pmid=16507533 |doi-access=free|issn=1076-836X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to taxonomy, whether subject to peer review or not, are regarded as reliant on the discretion of subsequent researchers who may choose to incorporate them into or ignore them in future works on the basis of their scientific rigour and the evidence provided.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cogger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cogger |first1=H. |last2=Shea |first2=G. |last3=Couper |first3=P. |title=Comment (Case 3601) – Some matters arising from the Case and the broader issues involved and the need to remove ambiguity in Chapter 3 of the Code |journal=[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]] |date=March 2017 |volume=73 |issue=2–4 |pages=106–112 |doi=10.21805/bzn.v73i2.a5|s2cid=157904952 |issn=0007-5167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to zoological nomenclature, meanwhile, are governed by the ICZN's ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (the ''Code''), of which a key component is the [[Principle of Priority]]: that "the valid name of a taxon is the oldest available name applied to it".{{efn|An ''[[available name]]'' is one which has not been explicitly suppressed by the ICZN and otherwise fulfils the requirements of the ''Code''.&lt;ref name="codeonline"&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |url=https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/ |website=The Code Online |publisher=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |access-date=19 March 2020 |date=2012|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-85301-006-7|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.50608|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="codeonline" /&gt; Thus the publication of a new name, so long as it complies with ''Code'' requirements but regardless of the quality of the source in which it appears, establishes it as a name of record.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

The ICZN published Grigg's case for suppressing the names provided in "A Synopsis of the Class Reptilia in Australia", "A Classification of the Amphibia and Reptilia of Australia" and "A Synopsis of the Amphibia and Reptilia of New Zealand" in the June 1987 issue of their journal, the ''[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]]''.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt; Case 2531 received "strong arguments" from at least 91 writers and was retrospectively characterised by the herpetologists David Williams, [[Wolfgang Wüster]] and Bryan Grieg Fry by "the usual professional decorum being notable by its absence in some of the attacks upon Wells and Wellington".&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

In the initial case to suppress the names, Grigg described several specific issues with the Wells and Wellington works. He wrote that their claim that they examined almost 40,000 specimens (translating to more than ten each day every day for ten years) was unlikely.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt; According to Grigg, the duo had taken 205 subspecies or synonyms directly from a 1983 book by [[Harold Cogger]] and colleagues and had elevated or resurrected them to species status with no further discussion.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt; He added that while Wells and Wellington had claimed to have visited several museums outside Australia to examine specimens in their collections, these museums confirmed with him that they had not lent or shown specimens to either Wellington or Wells.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt; Grigg wrote that while many taxonomists would likely reject the nomenclature contained in the three papers because of the quality of the underlying taxonomy, non-taxonomists unaware of the situation surrounding the works might accept the nomenclature, leading to nomenclatural destabilization.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt; This outcome, Grigg speculated, would require piecemeal acceptance or refutation of all of the hundreds of changes offered by the pair in their papers.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;

The researcher [[Glenn M. Shea]] wrote that the names in "A Synopsis of the Class Reptilia in Australia", even those accompanied by "inadequate or erroneous" diagnoses, fulfilled the requirements of the ''Code'' and were thus [[available name|available]].&lt;ref name="shea"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shea |first1=G. M. |title=Comment on the proposed suppression for nomenclatural purposes of three works by Richard W. Wells and C. Ross Wellington |journal=[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]] |date=December 1987 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=257–261 |doi=10.5962/bhl.part.349|doi-access=free|issn=0007-5167}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shea listed 43 species from "A Classification of the Amphibia and Reptilia of Australia" whose diagnoses did not differentiate them from the populations from which the pair was attempting to split them, and also identified three species whose diagnoses were reliant on works that were still in press at the time of Shea's comment (late 1987).&lt;ref name="shea" /&gt; Shea identified several proposed species whose [[holotype]]s were collected from outside the species' proposed [[species distribution|ranges]] and several well-known populations of species that were suddenly without names based on Wells and Wellington's diagnoses.&lt;ref name="shea" /&gt;

The researcher Jonathon Stone wrote that the ICZN permitting Wells and Wellington's names would set a negative precedent for subsequent researchers to enact nomenclatural changes without peer review.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt; Several researchers rejected the argument that suppressing the pair's names was an act of censorship.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hutchinson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hutchinson |first1=M.

In 1989, the researcher Kraig Adler published the book ''Contributions to the History of Herpetology''. Its index of herpetologists by John S. Applegarth intentionally omitted Wells and Wellington on the basis that their works were "inconsistent with acceptable practices of taxonomy".&lt;ref name="bouchet"&gt;{{cite journal |author1-link=Philippe Bouchet|last1=Bouchet |first1=P. |last2=Bour |first2=R. |last3=Dubois |first3=A. |last4=Goujet |first4=D. |last5=Hugot |first5=J.

The ICZN decided the case in September 1991.&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|author-link=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|title=Decision of the Commission: Three works by Richard W.

The term '''wetware''' is used to describe the protocols and molecular devices used in [[molecular biology]] and [[synthetic biology]].

Where biological components and systems are treated in a similar manner to software, and similar development models and methodologies are applied, the term 'wetware' can be used to imply an approach to their problems as 'bugs' and their beneficial aspects as 'features'. In this manner, genetic code can be subjected to [[Version Control Systems]] such as [[Git]], for the development of improvements and new gene edits, therapeutic components and therapies.

== Examples ==
The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) funded Wiki project Open Wetware (OWW) provides a resource for reagent, project and laboratory notebook sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page|title=Open Wetware (OWW)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A somewhat related NSF consortium Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC) constructs and distributes wetware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://synberc.org|title=NSF SynBERC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell''''' is a 1944 science book written for the lay reader by physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]].  The book was based on a course of public lectures delivered by Schrödinger in February 1943, under the auspices of the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] where he was Director of Theoretical Physics, at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  The lectures attracted an audience of about 400, who were warned "that the subject-matter was a difficult one and that the lectures could not be termed popular, even though the physicist’s most dreaded weapon, mathematical deduction, would hardly be utilized."&lt;ref name="Margulis"&gt;[[Lynn Margulis|Margulis, Lynn]]. &amp; [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan, Dorion]]. (1995). ''What Is Life?'' (pg. 1). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schrödinger's lecture focused on one important question: "how can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?"&lt;ref name="Margulis"/&gt;

In the book, Schrödinger introduced the idea of an "aperiodic crystal" that contained genetic information in its configuration of covalent [[chemical bond]]s. In the 1950s, this idea stimulated enthusiasm for discovering the chemical basis of [[genetics|genetic]] [[biological inheritance|inheritance]]. Although the existence of some form of hereditary information had been hypothesized since 1869, its role in reproduction and its helical shape were still unknown at the time of Schrödinger's lecture. In retrospect, Schrödinger's aperiodic crystal can be viewed as a well-reasoned theoretical prediction of what biologists should have been looking for during their search for [[genetic material]].{{cn|date=August 2020}} In 1953, [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] jointly proposed the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) based on, amongst other theoretical insights, [[X-ray diffraction]] experiments conducted by [[Rosalind Franklin]]. They both credited Schrödinger's book with presenting an early theoretical description of how the storage of genetic information would work, and each independently acknowledged the book as a source of inspiration for their initial researches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-link=James D.

== Background ==
The book is based on lectures delivered under the auspices of the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in February 1943, and was published in 1944. At that time, although DNA was known to be a constituent of cell nuclei, it had not yet been identified with certainty as the molecular basis of inheritance, and the concept of a "heredity molecule" was strictly theoretical, with various candidates. One of the most successful branches of physics at this time was [[statistical physics]]. Schrödinger himself is one of the founding fathers of [[quantum mechanics]], a theory which is also very statistical in its nature.

[[Max Delbrück]]'s thinking about the physical basis of life was an important influence on Schrödinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dronamraju KR |title=Erwin Schrödinger and the origins of molecular biology |journal=Genetics |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=1071–6 |date=November 1999 |doi=10.1093/genetics/153.3.1071 |pmid=10545442 |pmc=1460808 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/153/3/1071#Delbrucks_model}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, long before the publication of ''What is Life?'', the American geneticist [[Hermann J. Muller]], who would later win a Nobel Prize in 1946, had in his 1922 article "Variation due to Change in the Individual Gene"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=Hermann Joseph |title=Variation due to change in the individual gene |journal=The American Naturalist |date=1922 |volume=56 |issue=642 |pages=32–50 |url=http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/m/hjm-22.pdf |access-date=3 January 2021 |publisher=Electronic Scholarly Publishing Project (1996)|doi=10.1086/279846 |s2cid=31573243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; already laid out all the basic properties of the "heredity molecule" (not yet known to be DNA) which Schrödinger re-derived in 1944 "from first principles" in ''What is Life?'' (including the "aperiodicity" of the molecule), properties which Muller specified and refined additionally in his 1929 article "The Gene As The Basis of Life"&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the International Congress of Plant Sciences 1 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Pursuit of the Gene.

DNA as the molecule of heredity became foremost only after [[Oswald Avery]]'s bacterial-transformation experiments published in 1944; before those experiments, proteins were considered the most likely candidates. DNA was confirmed as the molecule in question by the
[[Hershey–Chase experiment]] conducted in 1952.

== Content ==
In Chapter I, Schrödinger explains that most physical laws on a large scale are due to [[chaos theory|chaos]] on a small scale. He calls this principle "order-from-disorder". As an example he mentions [[diffusion]], which can be modeled as a highly ordered process, but which is nevertheless caused by [[Brownian motion|random movement]] of atoms or molecules. As the number of atoms is reduced, the behaviour of a system becomes increasingly random. He states that life greatly depends on order and that a naïve physicist may assume that the master code of a living organism has to consist of a large number of atoms.

In Chapter II and III, he summarizes what was known at the time about the hereditary mechanism. Most importantly, he elaborates on the role [[mutation]]s play in biological [[evolution]]. He concludes that the carrier of hereditary information has to be both small in size and permanent in time, contradicting the naïve physicist's expectation. This contradiction cannot be resolved by [[classical physics]].

In Chapter IV, Schrödinger presents [[molecule]]s, which are indeed stable even if they consist of only a few atoms, as the solution. Even though molecules had long been known to exist, their stability could not be explained by [[classical physics]] due to the discrete nature of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, mutations are directly linked to [[Atomic electron transition|quantum leaps]].

He continues to explain, in chapter V, that true [[solid]]s, which are also permanent, are composed of highly ordered [[crystal]]s. The stability of molecules and crystals is due to the same principles, and a molecule might be called "the germ of a solid". On the other hand, an [[amorphous solid]], without crystalline structure, should be regarded as a [[liquid]] with a very high [[viscosity]]. Schrödinger writes that the heredity material is likely to be a molecule, which unlike a crystal does not repeat itself. He calls this an "aperiodic crystal". Its aperiodic nature allows it to encode an almost infinite number of possibilities with a small number of atoms. He finally compares this picture with the known facts and finds it in accordance with them.

In Chapter VI, Schrödinger states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ...living matter, while not eluding the "laws of physics" as established up to date, is likely to involve "other laws of physics" hitherto unknown, which however, once they have been revealed, will form just as integral a part of science as the former.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He anticipates that this statement will be open to misconception and tries to clarify it. The main principle involved with "order-from-disorder" is the [[second law of thermodynamics]], according to which [[entropy]] only increases in a [[closed system]] (such as the universe). Schrödinger explains that living matter evades the decay to [[thermodynamical equilibrium]] by homeostatically maintaining [[Entropy and life#Negative entropy|negative entropy]] in an [[open system]].

In Chapter VII, he maintains that "order-from-order" is not absolutely new to physics; in fact, it is even simpler and more plausible. But nature follows "order-from-disorder", with such exceptions as the predictable movement of the [[celestial bodies]] and the behaviour of mechanical devices such as clocks. Even those are influenced by thermal and frictional forces. The degree to which a system functions mechanically or randomly depends on the temperature. If sufficiently heated, a clock melts into a puddle of randomly moving molecules. Conversely, if the temperature approaches [[absolute zero]], any system behaves more and more mechanically. Some systems, such as clocks, approach this mechanical behaviour even at room temperature.

Schrödinger concludes this chapter and the book with [[philosophy|philosophical]] speculations on [[determinism]], [[free will]], and the mystery of human [[consciousness]]. He attempts to "see whether we cannot draw the correct non-contradictory conclusion from the following two premises: (1) My body functions as a pure mechanism according to Laws of Nature; and (2) Yet I know, by incontrovertible direct experience, that I am directing its motions, of which I foresee the effects, that may be fateful and all-important, in which case I feel and take full responsibility for them. The only possible inference from these two facts is, I think, that I – I in the widest meaning of the word, that is to say, every conscious mind that has ever said or felt 'I' – am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature". Schrödinger then states that this insight is not new and that the [[Upanishads]] considered this insight of "[[Atman (Hinduism)|ATMAN]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[Brahman|BRAHMAN]]" to "represent quintessence of deepest insights into the happenings of the world." Schrödinger rejects the idea that the source of consciousness should perish with the body because he finds the idea "distasteful". He also rejects the idea that there are multiple immortal souls that can exist without the body because he believes that consciousness is nevertheless highly dependent on the body. Schrödinger writes that, to reconcile the two premises,&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only possible alternative is simply to keep to the immediate experience that consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing…:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any intuitions that consciousness is plural, he says, are illusions. Schrödinger is sympathetic to the [[Hindu]] concept of [[Brahman]], by which each individual's consciousness is only a manifestation of a [[collective consciousness|unitary consciousness]] pervading the [[universe]] — which corresponds to the Hindu concept of God. Schrödinger concludes that "...'I' am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature." However, he also qualifies the conclusion as "necessarily subjective" in its "philosophical implications". In the final paragraph, he points out that what is meant by "I" is not the collection of experienced events but "namely the canvas upon which they are collected." If a hypnotist succeeds in blotting out all earlier reminiscences, he writes, there would be no loss of personal existence — "Nor will there ever be."&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger references ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]] as a "beautiful book" leveling with the view he has taken in the last chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schrödinger's "paradox" ==
In a world governed by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], all [[isolated system]]s are expected to approach a state of maximum disorder or [[entropy]]: an irreversible state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], where [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] is no longer available to do [[work (physics)|work]]. It has been argued that, since life approaches and maintains a highly ordered state, it violates the aforementioned second law, implying that there is a paradox. However, since the [[biosphere]] is not an isolated system, there is no paradox. The increase of order inside an organism is more than paid for by an increase in disorder outside this organism by the loss of heat into the environment. By this mechanism, the second law is obeyed, and life maintains a highly ordered state, which it sustains by causing a net increase in disorder in the Universe. In order to increase the complexity on Earth—as life does—free energy is needed, and in this case is provided by the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Life?'' p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'' Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the Whitley Awards in Australia|the Whitley Awards in the UK|Whitley Awards (UK)}}
The '''Whitley Awards''' have been awarded annually since 1979 by the [[Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales]] (RZSNSW).  They commemorate [[Gilbert Percy Whitley|Gilbert Whitley]], an eminent Australian [[ichthyologist]], and are presented for outstanding publications, either printed or electronic, that contain new information about the [[fauna]] of the [[Australasia]]n region.

For a publication to receive a Whitley Award it must either make a significant contribution of new information, present a new synthesis of existing information, or present existing information in a more acceptable form.  All texts must contain a significant proportion of information that relates directly to Australasian zoology.  Moreover, all submissions must have been published within 18 months of the awards entry date.

A presentation ceremony is held each year in September at the [[Australian Museum]] in [[Sydney]] when the authors and publishers of the winning titles receive their awards.

==Awards==
Certificates of Commendation may be awarded to publications judged as the best in various categories including, but not limited to, illustrated publications, textbooks, field guides, reference works, historical zoology, periodicals, handbooks, children’s publications, CD-ROMs, limited editions and videos.

===Whitley Medal===
The Whitley Medal may be awarded to a publication deemed to be of superior quality that makes a landmark contribution to the understanding, content or dissemination of zoological knowledge.  The Whitley Medal is the top award in zoological publishing in Australia and is not necessarily awarded every year, though sometimes more than one medal may be awarded.

'''Whole genome sequencing''' ('''WGS'''), also known as '''full genome sequencing''', '''complete genome sequencing''', or '''entire genome sequencing''', is the process of determining the entirety, or nearly the entirety, of the [[DNA]] sequence of an organism's [[genome]] at a single time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2012-07-20|title=Definition of whole-genome sequencing – NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/genetics-dictionary/def/whole-genome-sequencing|access-date=2018-10-13|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails sequencing all of an organism's [[chromosomal]] DNA as well as DNA contained in the [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondria]] and, for plants, in the [[chloroplast]].

Whole genome sequencing should not be confused with [[DNA profiling]], which only determines the likelihood that genetic material came from a particular individual or group, and does not contain additional information on genetic relationships, origin or susceptibility to specific diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Kijk magazine, 01 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, whole genome sequencing should not be confused with methods that sequence specific subsets of the genome – such methods include [[whole exome sequencing]] (1–2% of the genome) or [[SNP genotyping]] (&lt; 0.1% of the genome).

The DNA sequencing methods used in the 1970s and 1980s were manual; for example, [[Maxam–Gilbert sequencing]] and [[Sanger sequencing]]. Several whole bacteriophage and animal viral genomes were sequenced by these techniques, but the shift to more rapid, automated sequencing methods in the 1990s facilitated the sequencing of the larger bacterial and eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=Bruce Alberts ...

== Experimental details ==

=== Cells used for sequencing ===
Almost any biological sample containing a full copy of the DNA—even a very small amount of DNA or [[ancient DNA]]—can provide the genetic material necessary for full genome sequencing. Such samples may include [[saliva]], [[epithelial cells]], [[bone marrow]], [[hair]] (as long as the hair contains a [[hair follicle]]), [[seed]]s, plant leaves, or anything else that has DNA-containing cells.

{{anchor|single cell genome sequencing}}
The genome sequence of a single cell selected from a mixed population of cells can be determined using techniques of ''single cell genome sequencing''. This has important advantages in environmental microbiology in cases where a single cell of a particular microorganism species can be isolated from a mixed population by microscopy on the basis of its morphological or other distinguishing characteristics. In such cases the normally necessary steps of isolation and growth of the organism in culture may be omitted, thus allowing the sequencing of a much greater spectrum of organism genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braslavsky|first=Ido|title=Sequence information can be obtained from single DNA molecules|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|date=2003|volume=100|issue=7|pages=3960–3984|doi=10.1073/pnas.0230489100|pmid=12651960|pmc=153030|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.3960B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early techniques ===
[[File:ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer 3.jpg|right|thumbnail|An ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer. Such capillary sequencers automated the early efforts of sequencing genomes.]]
Sequencing of nearly an entire human genome was first accomplished in 2000 partly through the use of [[shotgun sequencing]] technology. While full genome shotgun sequencing for small (4000–7000 [[base pair]]) genomes was already in use in 1979,&lt;ref name="pmid461197"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Staden R | title = A strategy of DNA sequencing employing computer programs | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 2601–10 |date=June 1979 | pmid = 461197 | pmc = 327874 | doi = 10.1093/nar/6.7.2601| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; broader application benefited from pairwise end sequencing, known colloquially as ''double-barrel shotgun sequencing''. As sequencing projects began to take on longer and more complicated genomes, multiple groups began to realize that useful information could be obtained by sequencing both ends of a fragment of DNA. Although sequencing both ends of the same fragment and keeping track of the paired data was more cumbersome than sequencing a single end of two distinct fragments, the knowledge that the two sequences were oriented in opposite directions and were about the length of a fragment apart from each other was valuable in reconstructing the sequence of the original target fragment.

The first published description of the use of paired ends was in 1990 as part of the sequencing of the human [[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|HPRT]] locus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Edwards | first = A |author2=Caskey, T  | title = Closure strategies for random DNA sequencing | journal = Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–47 | date = 1991| doi = 10.1016/S1046-2023(05)80162-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the use of paired ends was limited to closing gaps after the application of a traditional shotgun sequencing approach. The first theoretical description of a pure pairwise end sequencing strategy, assuming fragments of constant length, was in 1991.&lt;ref name="pmid2341149"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edwards A | author2 = Voss H | author3 = Rice P| author4 = Civitello A | author5 = Stegemann J| author6 = Schwager C | author7 = Zimmermann J| author8 = Erfle H | author9 = Caskey CT| author10 = Ansorge W | title = Automated DNA sequencing of the human HPRT locus | journal = Genomics | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 593–608 |date=April 1990 | pmid = 2341149 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(90)90493-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the innovation of using fragments of varying sizes was introduced,&lt;ref name="pmid7601461"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roach JC | author2 = Boysen C | author3 = Wang K| author4 = Hood L | title = Pairwise end sequencing: a unified approach to genomic mapping and sequencing | journal = Genomics | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 345–53 |date=March 1995 | pmid = 7601461 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(95)80219-C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrated that a pure pairwise end-sequencing strategy would be possible on large targets. The strategy was subsequently adopted by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) to sequence the entire genome of the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' in 1995,&lt;ref name="pmid7542800"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fleischmann RD | author2 = Adams MD | author3 = White O| author4 = Clayton RA | author5 = Kirkness EF| author6 = Kerlavage AR | author7 = Bult CJ| author8 = Tomb JF | author9 = Dougherty BA| author10 = Merrick JM | title = Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd | journal = Science | volume = 269 | issue = 5223 | pages = 496–512 |date=July 1995 | pmid = 7542800 | doi = 10.1126/science.7542800 |bibcode = 1995Sci...269..496F | last11 = McKenney | last12 = Sutton | last13 = Fitzhugh | last14 = Fields | last15 = Gocyne | last16 = Scott | last17 = Shirley | last18 = Liu | last19 = Glodek | last20 = Kelley | last21 = Weidman | last22 = Phillips | last23 = Spriggs | last24 = Hedblom | last25 = Cotton | last26 = Utterback | last27 = Hanna | last28 = Nguyen | last29 = Saudek | last30 = Brandon | display-authors = 29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by [[Celera Genomics]] to sequence the entire fruit fly genome in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Adams | first = MD | title = The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5461 | pages = 2185–95 | date = 2000| pmid = 10731132   | doi = 10.1126/science.287.5461.2185 | bibcode=2000Sci...287.2185.|display-authors=etal| citeseerx = 10.1.1.549.8639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently the entire human genome. [[Applied Biosystems]], now called [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]], manufactured the automated capillary sequencers utilized by both Celera Genomics and The Human Genome Project.

=== Current techniques ===
{{Main|DNA Sequencing}}

While capillary sequencing was the first approach to successfully sequence a nearly full human genome, it is still too expensive and takes too long for commercial purposes. Since 2005 capillary sequencing has been progressively displaced by [[Next-generation sequencing|high-throughput]] (formerly "next-generation") sequencing technologies such as [[Illumina dye sequencing]], [[pyrosequencing]], and [[Single molecule real time sequencing|SMRT sequencing]].&lt;ref name="pmid19193124"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mukhopadhyay R | title = DNA sequencers: the next generation | journal = Anal.

Other technologies have emerged, including [[Nanopore sequencing|Nanopore technology]]. Though the sequencing accuracy of Nanopore technology is lower than those above, its read length is on average much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sevim |first1=Volkan |last2=Lee |first2=Juna |last3=Egan |first3=Robert |last4=Clum |first4=Alicia |last5=Hundley |first5=Hope |last6=Lee |first6=Janey |last7=Everroad |first7=R.

=== Analysis ===
In principle, full genome sequencing can provide the raw [[nucleotide]] sequence of an individual organism's DNA at a single point in time. However, further analysis must be performed to provide the biological or medical meaning of this sequence, such as how this knowledge can be used to help prevent disease. Methods for analyzing sequencing data are being developed and refined.

Because sequencing generates a lot of data (for example, there are approximately six billion [[base pair]]s in each human diploid genome), its output is stored electronically and requires a large amount of computing power and storage capacity.

While analysis of WGS data can be slow, it is possible to speed up this step by using dedicated hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Strickland |first=Eliza |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/biomedical/diagnostics/new-genetic-technologies-diagnose-critically-ill-infants-within-26-hours |title=New Genetic Technologies Diagnose Critically Ill Infants Within 26 Hours – IEEE Spectrum |website=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2015-10-14 |access-date=2016-11-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116160203/https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/biomedical/diagnostics/new-genetic-technologies-diagnose-critically-ill-infants-within-26-hours |archive-date=2015-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other technologies ==

=== DNA microarrays ===

Full genome sequencing provides information on a genome that is orders of magnitude larger than by [[DNA array]]s, the previous leader in genotyping technology.

For humans, DNA arrays currently provide genotypic information on up to one million genetic variants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu/gladstone/site/genomicscore/section/1919 |title=Genomics Core |publisher=Gladstone.ucsf.edu |access-date=2009-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630111736/http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu/gladstone/site/genomicscore/section/1919 |archive-date=June 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18803882"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nishida N | author2 = Koike A | author3 = Tajima A| author4 = Ogasawara Y | author5 = Ishibashi Y| author6 = Uehara Y | author7 = Inoue I| author8 = Tokunaga K | title = Evaluating the performance of Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 platform with 400 Japanese individuals | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 9 | issue = 1| page = 431 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18803882 | pmc = 2566316 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-9-431 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Petrone |first=Justin |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/arrays/illumina-decode-build-1m-snp-chip-q2-launch-coincide-release-affys-60-snp-array |title=Illumina, DeCode Build 1M SNP Chip; Q2 Launch to Coincide with Release of Affy's 6.0 SNP Array &amp;#124; BioArray News &amp;#124; Arrays |date=16 January 2007 |publisher=GenomeWeb |access-date=2009-02-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716115318/http://www.genomeweb.com/arrays/illumina-decode-build-1m-snp-chip-q2-launch-coincide-release-affys-60-snp-array |archive-date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while full genome sequencing will provide information on all six billion bases in the human genome, or 3,000&amp;nbsp;times more data. Because of this, full genome sequencing is considered a [[disruptive innovation]] to the DNA array markets as the accuracy of both range from 99.98% to 99.999% (in non-repetitive DNA regions) and their consumables cost of $5000 per 6 billion base pairs is competitive (for some applications) with DNA arrays ($500 per 1 million basepairs).&lt;ref name="genengnews1" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Mutation frequencies ===
Whole genome sequencing has established the [[mutation]] frequency for whole human genomes. The mutation frequency in the whole genome between generations for humans (parent to child) is about 70 new mutations per generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roach JC |author2=Glusman G |author3=Smit AF|title=Analysis of genetic inheritance in a family quartet by whole-genome sequencing |journal=Science |volume=328 |issue=5978 |pages=636–9 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20220176 |pmc=3037280 |doi=10.1126/science.1186802 |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2010Sci...328..636R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Campbell CD |author2=Chong JX |author3=Malig M |title=Estimating the human mutation rate using autozygosity in a founder population |journal=Nat.

In the specifically protein coding regions of the human genome, it is estimated that there are about 0.35 mutations that would change the protein sequence between parent/child generations (less than one mutated protein per generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keightley PD |title=Rates and fitness consequences of new mutations in humans |journal=Genetics |volume=190 |issue=2 |pages=295–304 |date=February 2012 |pmid=22345605 |pmc=3276617 |doi=10.1534/genetics.111.134668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cancer, mutation frequencies are much higher, due to [[genome instability]]. This frequency can further depend on patient age, exposure to DNA damaging agents (such as UV-irradiation or components of tobacco smoke) and the activity/inactivity of DNA repair mechanisms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  Furthermore, mutation frequency can vary between cancer types: in germline cells, mutation rates occur at approximately 0.023 mutations per megabase, but this number is much higher in breast cancer (1.18-1.66 somatic mutations per Mb), in lung cancer (17.7) or in melanomas (≈33).&lt;ref name="pmid23178448"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuna M |author2=Amos CI |title=Genomic sequencing in cancer |journal=Cancer Lett. |volume=340 |issue=2 |pages=161–70 |date=November 2013 |pmid=23178448 |doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2012.11.004 |pmc=3622788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the haploid human genome consists of approximately 3,200 megabases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-big-is-human-genome.html|title=Sandwalk: How Big Is the Human Genome?|first=Laurence A.|last=Moran|date=24 March 2011|website=sandwalk.blogspot.com|access-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131353/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-big-is-human-genome.html|archive-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; this translates into about 74 mutations (mostly in [[Noncoding DNA|noncoding]] regions) in germline DNA per generation, but 3,776-5,312 somatic mutations per haploid genome in breast cancer, 56,640 in lung cancer and 105,600 in melanomas.

In 2018, researchers at Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine in San Diego, CA determined that rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS) can diagnose genetic disorders in time to change acute medical or surgical management (clinical utility) and improve outcomes in acutely ill infants. The researchers reported a retrospective cohort study of acutely ill inpatient infants in a regional children's hospital from July 2016-March 2017. Forty-two families received rWGS for etiologic diagnosis of genetic disorders. The diagnostic sensitivity of rWGS was 43% (eighteen of 42 infants) and 10% (four of 42 infants) for standard genetic tests (P = .0005). The rate of clinical utility of rWGS (31%, thirteen of 42 infants) was significantly greater than for standard genetic tests (2%, one of 42; P = .0015). Eleven (26%) infants with diagnostic rWGS avoided morbidity, one had a 43% reduction in likelihood of mortality, and one started palliative care. In six of the eleven infants, the changes in management reduced inpatient cost by $800,000-$2,000,000. These findings replicate a prior study of the clinical utility of rWGS in acutely ill inpatient infants, and demonstrate improved outcomes and net healthcare savings. rWGS merits consideration as a first tier test in this setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farnaes |first1=Lauge |last2=Hildreth |first2=Amber |last3=Sweeney |first3=Nathaly M. |last4=Clark |first4=Michelle M. |last5=Chowdhury |first5=Shimul |last6=Nahas |first6=Shareef |last7=Cakici |first7=Julie A. |last8=Benson |first8=Wendy |last9=Kaplan |first9=Robert H. |last10=Kronick |first10=Richard |last11=Bainbridge |first11=Matthew N. |last12=Friedman |first12=Jennifer |last13=Gold |first13=Jeffrey J. |last14=Ding |first14=Yan |last15=Veeraraghavan |first15=Narayanan |last16=Dimmock |first16=David |last17=Kingsmore |first17=Stephen F. |title=Rapid whole-genome sequencing decreases infant morbidity and cost of hospitalization |journal=npj Genomic Medicine |date=December 2018 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=10 |doi=10.1038/s41525-018-0049-4 |pmid=29644095 |pmc=5884823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 review of 36 publications found the cost for whole genome sequencing to range from $1,906{{Nbsp}}USD to $24,810{{Nbsp}}USD and have a wide variance in diagnostic yield from 17% to 73% depending on patient groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarze |first1=K |last2=Buchanan |first2=J |last3=Taylor |first3=Jc |last4=Wordsworth |first4=S |title=Are whole Exome and whole Genome Sequencing Approaches Cost-Effective?

=== Rare variant association study ===
Whole genome sequencing studies enable the assessment of associations between complex traits and both coding and noncoding [[rare functional variant|rare variants]] ([[minor allele frequency]] (MAF) &lt; 1%) across the genome. Single-variant analyses typically have low power to identify associations with rare variants, and variant set tests have been proposed to jointly test the effects of given sets of multiple rare variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Seunggeung |last2=Abecasis |first2=Gonçalo R. |last3=Boehnke |first3=Michael |last4=Lin |first4=Xihong |title=Rare-Variant Association Analysis: Study Designs and Statistical Tests |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |date=July 2014 |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=5–23 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.06.009 |pmid=24995866 |pmc=4085641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SNP annotation]]s help to prioritize rare functional variants, and incorporating these annotations can effectively boost the power of genetic association of rare variants analysis of whole genome sequencing studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Xihao |last2=Li |first2=Zilin |last3=Zhou |first3=Hufeng |last4=Gaynor |first4=Sheila M. |last5=Liu |first5=Yaowu |last6=Chen |first6=Han |last7=Sun |first7=Ryan |last8=Dey |first8=Rounak |last9=Arnett |first9=Donna K. |last10=Aslibekyan |first10=Stella |last11=Ballantyne |first11=Christie M. |last12=Bielak |first12=Lawrence F. |last13=Blangero |first13=John |last14=Boerwinkle |first14=Eric |last15=Bowden |first15=Donald W. |last16=Broome |first16=Jai G. |last17=Conomos |first17=Matthew P. |last18=Correa |first18=Adolfo |last19=Cupples |first19=L.

Some ethicists insist that the privacy of individuals undergoing genetic testing must be protected.&lt;ref name="Sijmons 2011" /&gt; Indeed, [[privacy]] issues can be of particular concern when [[minor (law)|minors]] undergo genetic testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2009.25 | last1 = Borry | first1 = P. | last2 = Evers-Kiebooms | first2 = G. | last3 = Cornel | date = 2009 | first3 = MC | last4 = Clarke | first4 = A | last5 = Dierickx | first5 = K | author6 = Public Professional Policy Committee (PPPC) of the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) | title = Genetic testing in asymptomatic minors Background considerations towards ESHG Recommendations | journal = Eur J Hum Genet | volume = 17 | issue = 6| pages = 711–9 | pmid = 19277061 | pmc = 2947094 | author-link6 = European Society of Human Genetics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illumina's CEO, Jay Flatley, claimed in February 2009 that "by 2019 it will have become routine to map infants' genes when they are born".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Mark |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5689052.ece |title=Genetic mapping of babies by 2019 will transform preventive medicine |publisher=Times Online |date=2009-02-09 |access-date=2009-02-23 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511075525/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5689052.ece |archive-date=2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This potential use of genome sequencing is highly controversial, as it runs counter to established [[ethics|ethical]] [[Norm (social)|norms]] for predictive [[genetic testing]] of asymptomatic minors that have been well established in the fields of [[medical genetics]] and [[genetic counseling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCabe LL |author2=McCabe ER |title=Postgenomic medicine.

When an individual undergoes whole genome sequencing, they reveal information about not only their own DNA sequences, but also about probable DNA sequences of their close genetic relatives.&lt;ref name="Sijmons 2011" /&gt; This information can further reveal useful predictive information about relatives' present and future health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGuire|first=Amy, L|author2=Caulfield, Timothy |title=Science and Society: Research ethics and the challenge of whole-genome sequencing|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2008|volume=9|issue=2|pages=152–156|doi=10.1038/nrg2302|pmid=18087293|pmc=2225443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there are important questions about what obligations, if any, are owed to the family members of the individuals who are undergoing genetic testing. In Western/European society, tested individuals are usually encouraged to share important information on any genetic diagnoses with their close relatives, since the importance of the genetic diagnosis for offspring and other close relatives is usually one of the reasons for seeking a genetic testing in the first place.&lt;ref name="Sijmons 2011" /&gt; Nevertheless, a major ethical dilemma can develop when the patients refuse to share information on a diagnosis that is made for serious genetic disorder that is highly preventable and where there is a high risk to relatives carrying the same disease mutation. Under such circumstances, the clinician may suspect that the relatives would rather know of the diagnosis and hence the clinician can face a conflict of interest with respect to patient-doctor confidentiality.&lt;ref name="Sijmons 2011" /&gt;

Privacy concerns can also arise when whole genome sequencing is used in scientific research studies. Researchers often need to put information on patient's genotypes and phenotypes into public scientific databases, such as locus specific databases.&lt;ref name="Sijmons 2011" /&gt; Although only anonymous patient data are submitted to locus specific databases, patients might still be identifiable by their relatives in the case of finding a rare disease or a rare missense mutation.&lt;ref name="Sijmons 2011" /&gt; Public discussion around the introduction of advanced forensic techniques (such as advanced familial searching using public DNA ancestry websites and DNA phenotyping approaches) has been limited, disjointed, and unfocused. As forensic genetics and medical genetics converge toward genome sequencing, issues surrounding genetic data become increasingly connected, and additional legal protections may need to be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Caitlin|last2=Hereward|first2=James|last3=Mangelsdorf|first3=Marie|last4=Hussey|first4=Karen|last5=Devereux|first5=John|date=18 December 2018|title=Protecting trust in medical genetics in the new era of forensics|journal=Genetics in Medicine|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1483–1485|doi=10.1038/s41436-018-0396-7|pmid=30559376|pmc=6752261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, a '''whorl''' is a cluster of cells or tissue that surrounds another and wraps around another in an expanding circular pattern.  Whorls occur at the ends of different structures or in the middle of structures. Structures of some organs are often described as whorls and used in the aid of identification.

The [[Hassall's corpuscle]], formed from type VI [[epithelial]] [[reticular]] cells in the [[thymus]], is an example of a whorl-shaped structure.

The Women In Cell Biology Committee of the [[American Society for Cell Biology]] (ASCB) recognizes outstanding achievements by women in [[cell biology]] by presenting three (previously only two) Career Recognition Awards at the [[American Society for Cell Biology|ASCB]] Annual Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Women in Cell Biology Committee|url=http://www.ascb.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=12|publisher=The American Society For Cell Biology|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Junior Award is given to a woman in an early stage of her career (generally seven or eight years in an independent position) who has made exceptional scientific contributions to cell biology and exhibits the potential for continuing a high level of scientific endeavor while fostering the career development of damaged young scientists. The Mid-Career Award (introduced in 2012) is given to a woman at the mid-career level who has made exceptional scientific contributions to cell biology and/or has effectively translated cell biology across disciplines, and who exemplifies a high level of scientific endeavor and leadership. The Senior Award is given to a woman or man in a later career stage (generally full professor or equivalent) whose outstanding scientific achievements are coupled with a long-standing record of support for [[women in science]] and by mentorship of both men and women in scientific careers.

'''WiCell Research Institute''' is a scientific [[research institute]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] that focuses on stem cell research. Independently governed and supported as a [[501(c)(3)]] organization, WiCell operates as an affiliate of the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] and works to advance stem cell research at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and beyond.

==History==
Established in 1998 to develop [[stem cell]] technology, WiCell Research Institute is a [[nonprofit organization]] that creates and distributes human pluripotent [[stem cell]] lines worldwide. WiCell also provides [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and technical services, establishes scientific protocols and supports [[pure research|basic research]] on the UW-Madison campus.

WiCell serves as home to the Wisconsin International Stem Cell Bank. This stem cell repository stores, characterizes and provides access to stem cell lines for use in research and clinical development. The cell bank originally stored the first five human [[Embryonic stem cell]] lines derived by Dr. [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]] of UW–Madison. It currently houses human embryonic stem cell lines, [[induced pluripotent stem cell]] lines, clinical grade cell lines developed in accordance with [[Good manufacturing practice|Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)]] and differentiated cell lines including neural [[progenitor cell]]s.

To support continued progress in the field and help unlock the therapeutic potential of stem cells, in 2005 WiCell began providing [[Cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] services and quality control testing services. These services allow scientists to identify genetic abnormalities in cells or changes in stem cell colonies that might affect research results.

==Organization==
Chartered with a mission to support scientific investigation and research at UW–Madison, WiCell collaborates with faculty members and provides support with stem cell research projects. The institute established its cytogenetic laboratory to meet the growing needs of academic and commercial researchers to monitor genetic stability in stem cell cultures.

==Facilities==
WiCell maintains its stem [[cell bank]]ing facilities, testing and quality assurance laboratories and scientific team in UW–Madison’s University Research Park.

UW–Madison faculty members use the institute’s laboratory space to conduct research, improve stem cell culture techniques and develop materials used in stem cell research.

To ensure the therapeutic relevance of its cell lines, WiCell banks clinical grade cells under GMP guidelines. The organization works cooperatively with Waisman Biomanufacturing, a provider of cGMP manufacturing services for materials and therapeutics qualified for human clinical trials.

==Selected technologies==
The following technologies employed by WiCell allow scientists to conduct stem cell research with greater assurance of reproducible results, an expectation for publication in [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals. Scientific tools and services include:
* [[G banding|G-banded]] karyotyping, a baseline genomic screen that helps monitor genetic stability as cell colonies grow;
* Spectral [[Karyotype|karyotyping]], which may be used as an adjunct to g-banded karyotyping and helps define complex rearrangements as well as [[genetic marker]] chromosomes;
* CGH, SNP, and CGH + SNP [[Microarray]]s, which detect genomic gains and losses as well as copy number changes;
* [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH), a test used to confirm findings and screen for microdeletions or duplications of known targets;
* fastFISH, a rapid screen for large numbers of clones and a cost-effective tool for monitoring aneuploidy; and
* [[STR analysis|Short Tandem Repeat Analysis]], which may be used to monitor the identity of a cell line and confirm the relationship of induced pluripotent stem cells to their parent.

'''William Lawrence Tower''' ([[22 December]] [[1872]]&amp;ndash; [[July]] [[1967]]) was an American [[zoology|zoologist]], born in [[Halifax, Massachusetts|Halifax]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=William Lawrence Tower|title=Twenty-fifth Anniversary Report, 1897–1922|author=Harvard College (1780– ), Class of 1897|year=1922|page=558|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsgnAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA558}} There seems to be no evidence that W. L. Tower was alive in 1923. Was he missing and presumed death in [[Tampico]]?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Tower, William Lawrence|title=The book of Chicagoans|year=1917|location=Chicago|publisher=A. A. Marquess &amp; Co|page=680|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/bookofchicagoans1917leon#page/680/mode/2up/search/tower}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|Lawrence Scientific School (Harvard)]], the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|Harvard Graduate School]], and the [[University of Chicago]] ([[Bachelor of Science|B. S.]], 1902), where he taught thereafter, becoming associate professor in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;William Lawrence Tower appears twice (as of September 2014) in the ''[[Biography and Genealogy Master Index]]''. He is listed in vol. 15 of the ''[[National Cyclopedia of American Biography]]'' (published in 1916). He is also included in the 1969–1973 edition of ''Who Was Who in America'', but the information there is not up-to-date; an article that appeared 6 May 1917 in the ''Chicago Tribune'' indicates that he resigned from the U. of Chicago and moved to Arizona. Later articles indicate that Tower was a member of the officers' reserve corps. (information provided by U. of Chicago Library Service)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Tower was notable for his experimental work in [[heredity]], investigating the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and the laws of heredity in [[beetle]]s and publishing [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001492010 ''An Investigation of Evolution in Chrysomelid Beetles of the Genus Leptinotarsa''] (1906). This study is probably the first (albeit possibly discredited) of [[mutation]] in animals.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoloff, A. (1966). ''The Genetics of Tribolium and Related Species''. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/158/2/695#R10 Hawthorne, David J. (2001) AFLP-Based Genetic Linkage Map of the Colorado Potato Beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata: Sex Chromosomes and a Pyrethroid-Resistance Candidate Gene. Genetics 158: 695-700]&lt;/ref&gt; He published also ''The Development of the Colors and Color Patterns of Coleoptera'' (1903) and, with [[Stanley Coulter|Coulter]], [[William E. Castle|Castle]], [[Charles Davenport|Davenport]] and [[Edward Murray East|East]], an essay on ''Heredity and Eugenics'' (1912).

Tower was caught up in personal and professional scandals. He resigned from the University of Chicago in 1917 following a very public divorce, but by then he had become a source of discontent among students and faculty. His professed [[atheism]] caused offense to some, including graduate student [[Warder Clyde Allee]]. Tower caused political friction within the department and many members distrusted his professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Mitman, Gregg (1992). ''The State of Nature: Ecology, Community, and American Social Thought, 1900-1950''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 52, 97. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gtxwqcwEoS0C Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental results which Tower reported in 1906 and 1910 were found to include serious discrepancies which he declined to explain. His claim that experimental results had been lost in a fire increased his colleagues' skepticism. [[William Bateson]], [[Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell|T. D. A. Cockerell]], and [[R. A. Gortner]] were particularly critical of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Alexander. (1998). ''A Note on W. L. Tower's Lepinotarsa Work''. In [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Will Provine]]. ''The Evolutionary Synthesis: Perspectives on the Unification of Biology''. Harvard University Press. pp. 352-353. {{ISBN|0-674-27226-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive reception came from the botanist [[Henry Chandler Cowles]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, Henry Chandler. (1907). ''Evolution in the Potato Beetles. An Investigation of Evolution in Chrysomelid Beetles of the Genus Leptinotarsa by W. L. Tower''. ''[[International Journal of Plant Sciences|Botanical Gazette]]''. Vol. 44, No. 6, pp. 456-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested that his research may have been faked.&lt;ref&gt;Mitman, Gregg. (1992). ''The State of Nature: Ecology, Community, and American Social Thought, 1900-1950''. University of Chicago Press. p. 219. {{ISBN|0-226-53236-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geneticist [[William E. Castle]] who visited Tower's laboratory was not impressed by the experimental conditions. He later concluded that Tower had faked his data. Castle found the fire suspicious and also Tower's claim that a steam leak in his [[greenhouse]] had destroyed all his beetle stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Robert E. (2002).

      <text bytes="3769" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Three-domain tree of life}}

The '''Woeseian revolution''' was the progression of the phylogenetic [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] concept from two main divisions, known as the [[Prokarya]] and [[Eukarya]], into three domains now classified as [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and Eukaryotes. The discovery of the new domain stemmed from the work of biophysicist [[Carl Woese]] in 1977 from a principle of evolutionary biology designated as [[Woese's dogma]]. It states that the evolution of [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) was a necessary precursor to the evolution of modern life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionary of Theories| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590452| url-access=registration| year=2002| page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590452/page/557 557]| last=Bothamley| first=Jennifer| isbn=9781578590452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the three-domain system has been widely accepted, the initial introduction of Woese’s discovery received criticism from the scientific community.

== Phylogenetic implications ==
The basis of [[phylogenetics]] was limited by the technology of the time, which led to a greater dependence on phenotypic classification prior to advances that would allow for molecular methods of organization. This was a major reason why the dichotomy of all living things, being either animal or plant in nature, was deemed as an acceptable theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woese|first1=C.R.|last2=Kandler|first2=O.|last3=Wheelis|first3=M.L.|title=Towards a natural system of organisms: Proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1990|volume=87|issue=12|pages=4576–79|doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576|pmid=2112744|pmc=54159|bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without truly understanding the genetic implication of each organismal classification in phylogenies via nucleic acid sequencing of shared molecular material, the phylogenetic tree of life and other such phylogenies would no doubt be incorrect. Woese’s advances in molecular sequencing and phylogenetic organization allowed for a better understanding of the three domains of life - the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes. In regards to their varying types of shared rRNA, that of the small subunit rRNA was deemed as the best molecules to sequence in order to distinguish phylogenetic relationships because of its relatively small size, ease of isolation, and universal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woese|first1=C.R.|title=Phylogenetic trees: Whither microbiology?|journal=Current Biology|date=1996|volume=6|issue=9|pages=1060–63|doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(02)70664-7|pmid=8805350|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
This reorganization caused an initial pushback: it wasn't accepted until nearly a decade after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sapp|first1=Jan|title=The new foundations of evolution: on the tree of life|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible factors that led to initial criticisms of his discovery included Woese’s [[oligonucleotide]] cataloging, of which he was one of “only two or three people in the world” to be able to execute this method, let alone read the films. Further, Woese’s background was in physics, whereas most of the research was being done in the realm of microbiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morell|first1=V|title=Microbial Biology: Microbiology's scarred revolutionary|journal=Science|date=1997|volume=276|issue=5313|pages=699–702|doi=10.1126/science.276.5313.699|pmid=9157549|s2cid=84866217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RosmaryStem SatCrop BgSub.jpg|thumb|right|A section of [[rosemary]] stem, an example of a woody plant, showing a typical wood structure.]]
A '''woody plant''' is a [[plant]] that produces [[wood]] as its structural tissue and thus has a hard stem. In cold climates, woody plants further survive [[winter]] or [[dry season]] above ground, as opposite to [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] plants that die back to the ground until [[Spring (season)|spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Learn About Examples of Woody Plants|url=https://www.thespruce.com/woody-plants-meaning-examples-2131128|access-date=2020-09-17|website=The Spruce|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Woody plants are usually either [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, or [[liana]]s. These are usually [[perennial plant]]s whose stems and larger roots are reinforced with wood produced from secondary [[xylem]]. The main stem, larger branches, and roots of these plants are usually covered by a layer of [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. Wood is a structural [[cell (biology)|tissue]] that allows woody plants to grow from above ground stems year after year, thus making some woody plants the largest and tallest [[terrestrial plant]]s.

Woody plants, like herbaceous perennials, typically have a dormant period of the year when growth does not take place, in colder climates due to freezing temperatures and lack of daylight during the winter months, in subtropical and tropical climates due to the dry season when precipitation becomes minimal. The dormant period will be accompanied by shedding of leaves if the plant is deciduous. Evergreen plants do not lose all their leaves at once (they instead shed them gradually over the growing season), however growth virtually halts during the dormant season. Many woody plants native to subtropical regions and nearly all native to the tropics are evergreen due to year-round warm temperatures.

During the fall months, each stem in a deciduous plant cuts off the flow of nutrients and water to the leaves. This causes them to change colors as the chlorophyll in the leaves breaks down. Special cells are formed that sever the connection between the leaf and stem, so that it will easily detach. Evergreen plants do not shed their leaves and merely go into a state of low activity during the dormant season. During spring, the roots begin sending nutrients back up to the canopy.

When the growing season resumes, either with warm weather or the wet season, the plant will break bud by sending out new leaf or flower growth. This is accompanied by growth of new stems from buds on the previous season's wood. In colder climates, most stem growth occurs during spring and early summer. When the dormant season begins, the new growth hardens off and becomes woody. Once this happens, the stem will never grow in length again, however it will keep expanding in diameter for the rest of the plant's life.

Most woody plants native to colder climates have distinct [[growth ring]]s produced by each year's production of new vascular tissue. Only the outer handful of rings contain living tissue (the [[cambium]], [[xylem]], [[phloem]], and [[Sapwood (wood)|sapwood]]). Inner layers have heartwood, dead tissue that serves merely as structural support.

== Growth ==
[[File:Cercidiphyllum japonicum 03-02.19.jpg|thumb|Winter buds on [[Cercidiphyllum japonicum]].]]
Stem growth primarily occurs out of the terminal bud on the tip of the stem. Buds on the sides of the stem are suppressed by the terminal bud and produce less growth, unless it is removed by human or natural action. Without a terminal bud, the side buds will have nothing to suppress them and begin rapidly sending out growth, if cut during spring. By late summer and early autumn, most active growth for the season has ceased and pruning a stem will result in little or no new growth. Winter buds are formed when the dormant season begins. Depending on the plant, these buds contain either new leaf growth, new flowers, or both.

Terminal buds have a stronger dominance on conifers than broadleaf plants, thus conifers will normally grow a single straight trunk without forking or large side or lateral branches.

As a woody plant grows, it will often lose lower leaves and branches as they become shaded out by the canopy. If a given stem is producing an insufficient amount of energy for the plant, the roots will "abort" it by cutting off the flow of water and nutrients, causing it to gradually die.

Below ground, the root system expands each growing season in much the same manner as the stems. The roots grow in length and send out smaller lateral roots. At the end of the growing season, the newly grown roots become woody and cease future length expansion, but will continue to expand in diameter. However, unlike the above-ground portion of the plant, the root system continues to grow, although at a slower rate, throughout the dormant season. In cold-weather climates, root growth will continue as long as temperatures are above 36&amp;nbsp;°F (2&amp;nbsp;°C).

== Tissue composition ==
Wood is primarily composed of xylem cells with [[cell wall]]s made of [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. Xylem is a [[vascular tissue]] which moves water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Most woody plants form new layers of woody tissue each year, and so increase their stem diameter from year to year, with new wood deposited on the inner side of a [[vascular cambium]] layer located immediately beneath the bark. However, in some [[monocotyledons]] such as [[Arecaceae|palms]] and [[Dracaena (plant)|dracaenas]], the wood is formed in bundles scattered through the interior of the trunk. Stem diameter increases continuously throughout the growing season and halts during the dormant period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Mark W. |year=2004 |title=Monocot relationships: an overview |journal=[[American Journal of Botany|Am.

Under specific conditions, woody plants may [[Decomposition|decay]] or may in time become [[petrified wood]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Waclogo.jpg|right|frame]] --&gt;
The '''World Association of Copepodologists''' (WAC) is a [[non-profit organization]] created to promote research on [[copepod]]s by facilitating communication among interested specialists.&lt;ref name="in"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monoculus.org | title=Welcome ... | publisher=World Association of Copepodologists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WAC has about 130 members worldwide.  Although the World Association of Copepodologists is composed primarily of [[university]] [[professors]] and [[professional]] [[researcher]]s, "any person interested in any aspect of the study of Copepoda is eligible for membership."&lt;ref&gt;Estimate of "about 130 members" based upon recent information from the Treasurer&lt;/ref&gt;

The business of the WAC is conducted primarily at a business meeting held every three years at the International Conference on Copepoda (ICOC). Since 1987, conferences have been held at venues in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. The 13th conference was held in July 2017 at the [[Cabrillo Marine Aquarium]] in [[San Pedro, California]], United States. The 14th  conference is to be held in July 2020 in [[Kruger National Park]] in South Africa. Recent conferences have attracted about 250-350 participants.

The WAC assists the local organizers of the ICOCs in sponsoring and organizing workshops associated with these conferences. Most workshops train students in identification and other practical aspects of copepod studies.

Between conferences, communication between members takes place through the society newsletter '''''Monoculus''''' and via such [[on-line]] resources as the society website hosted by the [Senckenberg Research Institute] in [Wilhelmshaven] Germany and [[Internet forum]]s hosted by academic bodies such as the Asociación [[Latin America|Latinoamericana]] de [[List of carcinologists|Carcinología]] and the [[Virginia]] Institute of [[Marine Science]]. ''Monoculus'', the name of the [[newsletter]], is [[Latin]] for "one-eyed" and refers to a shared feature of many members of [[Class (biology)|subclass]] Copepoda.

==History==
In 1979, copepodologist Dov Por wrote a letter to the [[meiofauna]] newsletter ''Psammonalia'' suggesting the creation of both a [[symposium]] and a newsletter dedicated to the discussion of the Copepoda.  There was a small response to this initiative, which increased when the suggestion was repeated in ''[[Crustaceana]]'', a publication dedicated to [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref name="his"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monoculus.org/en/history-of-copepodology | title=Brief History of the WAC| publisher=World Association of Copepodologists}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a circular letter was sent out to 87 copepodologists around the world, of whom 34 replied. In a second letter, Dov Por announced that the first International Conference on Copepods was to be organized by the copepodologist Jan Stock and was scheduled for August 1981 in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].  It was also announced that the copepodologist Kurt Schminke would edit the newsletter.&lt;ref name="his"/&gt;

In October 1980 the first issue of ''Monoculus'' was published.  About 120 copepodologists attended that first conference in Amsterdam and it was deemed a great success.&lt;ref name="his"/&gt;

The Second International Conference on Copepoda was organized by copepodologist Chang-tai Shih and held in August 1984 in [[Ottawa]], Canada.  Here it was decided to establish a formal organization, the World Association of Copepodologists.  [[Zbigniew Kabata]], a [[veteran]] of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]], was elected as the first president.&lt;ref name="his"/&gt; Subsequent presidents included Arthur Humes, Geoff Boxshall, Kurt Schminke, Ju-shey Ho, Shin-ichi Uye, Janet Bradford, Rony Huys, Eduardo Suárez-Morales, and Diana Paola Galassi. A popular feature of each conference is the "Maxilliped Lecture" given by the outgoing president, who then passes on the pectoral pendant, a metal maxilliped on a chain, to the incoming president.

{{short description|Science of synthetic life forms}}

'''Xenobiology''' ('''XB''') is a subfield of [[synthetic biology]], the study of synthesizing and manipulating biological devices and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Budisa|first1=Nediljko|last2=Kubyshkin|first2=Vladimir|last3=Schmidt|first3=Markus|title=Xenobiology: A Journey towards Parallel Life Forms|journal=ChemBioChem|date=22 April 2020|volume=21|issue=16|pages=2228–2231|doi=10.1002/cbic.202000141|pmid=32323410|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "xenobiology" derives from the Greek word [[Xenos (Greek)|''xenos'']], which means "stranger, alien". Xenobiology is a form of biology that is not (yet) familiar to science and is not found in nature.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Markus|title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool|journal=BioEssays|date=9 March 2010|volume=32|issue=4|pages=322–31|doi=10.1002/bies.200900147|pmid=20217844|pmc=2909387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it describes novel biological systems and biochemistries that differ from the canonical [[DNA]]–[[RNA]]-20 [[amino acid]] system (see [[central dogma of molecular biology]]). For example, instead of DNA or RNA, XB explores [[nucleic acid analogues]], termed [[xeno nucleic acid]] (XNA) as information carriers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinheiro | first1 = V.B. | last2 = Holliger | first2 = P. | year = 2012 | title = The XNA world: Progress towards replication and evolution of synthetic genetic polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3–4| pages = 245–52 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.05.198| pmid = 22704981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also focuses on an [[expanded genetic code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bain | first1 = J. D. | last2 = Switzer | first2 = C. | last3 = Chamberlin | first3 = R. | last4 = Bennert | first4 = Steven A. | year = 1992 | title = Ribosome-mediated incorporation of a non-standard amino acid into a peptide through expansion of the genetic code | journal = Nature | volume = 356 | issue = 6369| pages = 537–39 | doi=10.1038/356537a0 | pmid=1560827| bibcode = 1992Natur.356..537B | s2cid = 4286160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the incorporation of non-[[proteinogenic amino acids]] into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noren | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Anthony-Cahill | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Griffith | first3 = M.C. | last4 = Schultz | first4 = P.G. | year = 1989 | title = A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901| pages = 182–88 | doi=10.1126/science.2649980 | pmid=2649980| bibcode = 1989Sci...244..182N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between xeno-, exo-, and astro-biology==
"Astro" means "star" and "exo" means "outside". Both exo- and [[astrobiology]] deal with the search for naturally evolved life in the Universe, mostly on other planets in the [[circumstellar habitable zone]]. (These are also occasionally referred to as xenobiology.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"/&gt;) Whereas astrobiologists are concerned with the detection and analysis of life elsewhere in the Universe, xenobiology attempts to design forms of life with a different biochemistry or different [[genetic code]] than on planet Earth.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"/&gt;

==Aims ==
* Xenobiology has the potential to reveal fundamental knowledge about biology and the [[origin of life]]. In order to better understand the origin of life, it is necessary to know why life evolved seemingly via an early RNA world to the DNA-RNA-protein system and its nearly universal genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | year = 2001 | title = The universal nature of biochemistry | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 98 | issue = 3| pages = 805–08 | doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | pmid=11158550 | pmc=33372| bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..805P | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Was it an evolutionary "accident" or were there constraints that ruled out other types of chemistries? By testing alternative biochemical "primordial soups", it is expected to better understand the principles that gave rise to life as we know it.
* Xenobiology is an approach to develop industrial production systems with novel capabilities by means of biopolymer engineering and pathogen resistance. The genetic code encodes in all organisms 20 canonical amino acids that are used for protein biosynthesis. In rare cases, special amino acids such as selenocysteine, pyrrolysine or formylmethionine, can be incorporated by the translational apparatus in to proteins of some organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wiltschi, B. and N. Budisa, "Natural history and experimental evolution of the genetic code". ''Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology'', 2007. 74: pp. 739–53&lt;/ref&gt; By using additional amino acids from among the over 700 known to biochemistry, the capabilities of proteins may be altered to give rise to more efficient catalytical or material functions.  The EC-funded project Metacode,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meta-code.eu/|title=Metacode - Home|publisher=Metacode|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019035901/http://www.meta-code.eu/|archive-date=October 19, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, aims to incorporate metathesis (a useful catalytical function so far not known in living organisms) into bacterial cells. Another reason why XB could improve production processes lies in the possibility to reduce the risk of virus or bacteriophage contamination in cultivations since XB cells would no longer provide suitable host cells, rendering them more resistant (an approach called semantic containment)
* Xenobiology offers the option to design a "genetic firewall", a novel biocontainment system, which may help to strengthen and diversify current bio-containment approaches.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"/&gt; One concern with traditional genetic engineering and biotechnology is [[horizontal gene transfer]] to the environment and possible risks to human health. One major idea in XB is to design alternative genetic codes and biochemistries so that horizontal gene transfer is no longer possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally alternative biochemistry also allows for new synthetic auxotrophies. The idea is to create an orthogonal biological system that would be incompatible with natural genetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herdewijn | first1 = P | last2 = Marlière | first2 = P | date = Jun 2009 | title = Toward safe genetically modified organisms through the chemical diversification of nucleic acids | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity | volume = 6 | issue = 24| pages = 791–808 | doi=10.1002/cbdv.200900083| pmid = 19554563 | s2cid = 8572188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approach==
In xenobiology, the aim is to design and construct biological systems that differ from their natural counterparts on one or more fundamental levels. Ideally these new-to-nature organisms would be different in every possible biochemical aspect exhibiting a very different genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term goal is to construct a cell that would store its genetic information not in DNA but in an alternative informational polymer consisting of xeno nucleic acids (XNA), different base pairs, using non-canonical amino acids and an altered genetic code. So far cells have been constructed that incorporate only one or two of these features.

===Xeno nucleic acids (XNA)===
{{Main|Xeno nucleic acid}}
Originally this research on alternative forms of DNA was driven by the question of how life evolved on earth and why RNA and DNA were selected by (chemical) evolution over other possible nucleic acid structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eschenmoser | first1 = A | year = 1999 | title = Chemical etiology of nucleic acid structure | url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/293874/files/pac200072030343.pdf| journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5423| pages = 2118–24 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2118| pmid = 10381870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hypotheses for the selection of RNA and DNA as life's backbone are either they are favored under life on Earth's conditions, or they were coincidentally present in pre-life chemistry and continue to be used now.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catalysts from synthetic genetic polymers|journal = Nature|pmc = 4336857|pmid = 25470036|pages = 427–30|volume = 518|issue = 7539|doi = 10.1038/nature13982|first1 = Alexander I.|last1 = Taylor|first2 = Vitor B.|last2 = Pinheiro|first3 = Matthew J.|last3 = Smola|first4 = Alexey S.|last4 = Morgunov|first5 = Sew|last5 = Peak-Chew|first6 = Christopher|last6 = Cozens|first7 = Kevin M.|last7 = Weeks|first8 = Piet|last8 = Herdewijn|first9 = Philipp|last9 = Holliger|year = 2015|bibcode = 2015Natur.518..427T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic experimental studies aiming at the diversification of the chemical structure of nucleic acids have resulted in completely novel informational biopolymers.

This study, using a binary (G/T) genetic cassette and two non-DNA bases (Hx/U), was extended to CeNA, while GNA seems to be too alien at this moment for the natural biological system to be used as template for DNA synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/anie.201303288|title = Binary Genetic Cassettes for Selecting XNA-Templated DNA Synthesis in Vivo| journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition| volume=52| issue=31| pages=8139–43|year = 2013|last1 = Pezo|first1 = Valérie| last2=Liu| first2=Feng Wu| last3=Abramov| first3=Mikhail| last4=Froeyen| first4=Mathy| last5=Herdewijn| first5=Piet| last6=Marlière| first6=Philippe| pmid=23804524|url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/413046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extended bases using a natural DNA backbone could, likewise, be transliterated into natural DNA, although to a more limited extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krueger | first1 = AT. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = Encoding Phenotype in Bacteria with an Alternative Genetic Set | journal = J.

Aside being used as extensions to template DNA strands, XNA activity has been tested for use as genetic [[Catalysis|catalysts]]. Although proteins are the most common components of cellular [[Enzyme|enzymatic activity]], nucleic acids are also used in the cell to catalyze reactions. A 2015 study found several different kinds of XNA, most notably FANA (2'-fluoroarabino nucleic acids), as well as HNA, CeNA and ANA (arabino nucleic acids) could be used to cleave RNA during [[Post-transcriptional modification|post-transcriptional RNA processing]] acting as XNA enzymes, hence the name XNAzymes. FANA XNAzymes also showed the ability to ligate DNA, RNA and XNA substrates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although XNAzyme studies are still preliminary, this study was a step in the direction of searching for [[Synthetic biological circuit|synthetic circuit components]] that are more efficient than those containing DNA and RNA counterparts that can regulate DNA, RNA, and their own, XNA, substrates.

===Expanding the genetic alphabet===
{{Main|Base pair#Unnatural base pair (UBP)|l1=Unnatural base pair|Expanded genetic code}}
While XNAs have modified backbones, other experiments target the replacement or enlargement of the genetic alphabet of DNA with unnatural base pairs. For example, DNA has been designed that has – instead of the four standard bases A, T, G, and C – six bases A, T, G, C, and the two new ones P and Z (where Z stands for 6-Amino-5-nitro3-(l'-p-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone, and P stands for 2-Amino-8-(1-beta-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4 (8H)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sismour | first1 = A.M. | display-authors = etal    | year = 2004 | title = PCR amplification of DNA containing non-standard base pairs by variants of reverse transcriptase from Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 728–35 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkh241 | pmid=14757837 | pmc=373358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Hutter | first2 = D. | last3 = Sheng | first3 = P. | last4 = Sismour | first4 = A.M. | last5 = Benner | first5 = S.A. | year = 2006 | title = Artificially expanded genetic information system: a new base pair with an alternative hydrogen bonding pattern | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 21| pages = 6095–101 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkl633 | pmid=17074747 | pmc=1635279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Sismour | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Sheng | first3 = P. | last4 = Puskar | first4 = N.L. | last5 = Benner | first5 = S.A. | year = 2007 | title = Enzymatic incorporation of a third nucleobase pair | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 13| pages = 4238–49 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkm395| pmid = 17576683 | pmc = 1934989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a systematic study, Leconte et al. tested the viability of 60 candidate bases (yielding potentially 3600 base pairs) for possible incorporation in the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leconte | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Hwang | first2 = G.T. | last3 = Matsuda | first3 = S. | last4 = Capek | first4 = P. | last5 = Hari | first5 = Y. | last6 = Romesberg | first6 = F.E. | year = 2008 | title = Discovery, characterization, and optimization of an unnatural base pair for expansion of the genetic alphabet | journal = J.

In 2002, Hirao et al. developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions ''in vitro'' in transcription and translation toward a genetic code for protein synthesis containing a non-standard amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirao | first1 = I. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = An unnatural base pair for incorporating amino acid analogs into proteins | journal = Nat.

In May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial [[nucleotides]] into bacterial DNA, alongside the four naturally occurring nucleotides, and by including individual artificial nucleotides in the culture media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins able to use the artificial nucleotides.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140507"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |title=Researchers Report Breakthrough in Creating Artificial Genetic Code |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html |date=May 7, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=May 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATURE-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Callaway |first=Ewen |title=First life with 'alien' DNA |url=http://www.nature.com/news/first-life-with-alien-dna-1.15179 |date=May 7, 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15179 |s2cid=86967999 |access-date=May 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malyshev |first1=Denis A. |last2=Dhami |first2=Kirandeep |last3=Lavergne |first3=Thomas |last4=Chen |first4=Tingjian |last5=Dai |first5=Nan |last6=Foster |first6=Jeremy M. |last7=Corrêa |first7=Ivan R. |last8=Romesberg |first8=Floyd E. |title=A semi-synthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet |date=May 7, 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature13314 |pmid=24805238 |pmc=4058825 |volume=509 |issue=7500 |pages=385–88|bibcode=2014Natur.509..385M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novel polymerases===
Neither the XNA nor the unnatural bases are recognized by natural [[polymerase]]s. One of the major challenges is to find or create novel types of polymerases that will be able to replicate these new-to-nature constructs. In one case a modified variant of the [[HIV]]-[[reverse transcriptase]] was found to be able to PCR-amplify an oligonucleotide containing a third type base pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sismour | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Benner | first2 = S.A. | year = 2005 | title = The use of thymidine analogs to improve the replication of an extra DNA base pair: a synthetic biological system | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = 17| pages = 5640–46 | doi=10.1093/nar/gki873 | pmid=16192575 | pmc=1236980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Havemann | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Hoshika | first2 = S. | last3 = Hutter | first3 = D. | last4 = Benner | first4 = S.A. | year = 2008 | title = Incorporation of multiple sequential pseudothymidines by DNA polymerases and their impact on DNA duplex structure | journal = Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 261–78 | doi=10.1080/15257770701853679| pmid = 18260010 | s2cid = 13771636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pinheiro et al. (2012) demonstrated that the method of polymerase evolution and design successfully led to the storage and recovery of genetic information (of less than 100bp length) from six alternative genetic polymers based on simple nucleic acid architectures not found in nature, [[xeno nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinheiro | first1 = VB | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079| pages = 341–44 | doi=10.1126/science.1217622| pmid = 22517858 | bibcode = 2012Sci...336..341P | pmc = 3362463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic code engineering===
One of the goals of xenobiology is to rewrite the [[genetic code]]. The most promising approach to change the code is the reassignment of seldom used or even unused codons.&lt;ref&gt;Budisa, N. (2005). ''Engineering the Genetic Code – Expanding the Amino Acid Repertoire for the Design of Novel Proteins'', Wiley-VHC Weinheim, New York, Brisbane, Singapore, Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;
In an ideal scenario, the genetic code is expanded by one codon, thus having been liberated from its old function and fully reassigned to a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) ("code expansion").  As these methods are laborious to implement, and some short cuts can be applied ("code engineering"), for example in bacteria that are auxotrophic for specific amino acids and at some point in the experiment are fed isostructural analogues instead of the canonical amino acids for which they are auxotrophic. In that situation, the canonical amino acid residues in native proteins are substituted with the ncAAs. Even the insertion of multiple different ncAAs into the same protein is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoesl | first1 = M. G. | last2 = Budisa | first2 = N. | year = 2012 | title = Recent advances in genetic code engineering in Escherichia coli | url =https://zenodo.org/record/896883 | journal = Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. | volume = 23 | issue = 5| pages = 751–57 | doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2011.12.027 | pmid=22237016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the repertoire of 20 canonical amino acids can not only be expanded, but also reduced to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pezo | first1 = V. | last2 = Guérineau | first2 = V. | last3 = Le Caer | first3 = J.-P. | last4 = Faillon | first4 = L. | last5 = Mutzel | first5 = R. | last6 = Marlière | first6 = P. | year = 2013 | title = A metabolic prototype for eliminating tryptophan from the genetic code | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | page = 1359 | doi=10.1038/srep01359 | pmid=23447021 | pmc=3584311| bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1359P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By reassigning transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs the codon specificity can be changed. Cells endowed with such aminoacyl-[tRNA synthetases] are thus able to read [mRNA] sequences that make no sense to the existing gene expression machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rackham | first1 = O. | last2 = Chin | first2 = J.W. | year = 2005 | title = A network of orthogonal ribosome mRNA pairs. Nat | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 159–66 | doi=10.1038/nchembio719| pmid = 16408021 | s2cid = 37181098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altering the codon: tRNA synthetases pairs may lead to the in vivo incorporation of the non-canonical amino acids into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = L. | last2 = Brock | first2 = A. | last3 = Herberich | first3 = B. | last4 = Schultz | first4 = P.G. | year = 2001 | title = Expanding the genetic code of Escherichia coli | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5516| pages = 498–500 | doi=10.1126/science.1060077 | pmid=11313494| bibcode = 2001Sci...292..498W | s2cid = 6702011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartman | first1 = M.C. | last2 = Josephson | first2 = K. | last3 = Lin | first3 = C.W. | last4 = Szostak | first4 = J.W. | year = 2007 | title = An expanded set of amino acid analogs for the ribosomal translation of unnatural peptides | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 10| page = e972 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000972 | pmid=17912351 | pmc=1989143| bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..972H | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the past reassigning codons was mainly done on a limited scale. In 2013, however, Farren Isaacs and George Church at Harvard University reported the replacement of all 321 TAG stop codons present in the genome of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' with synonymous TAA codons, thereby demonstrating that massive substitutions can be combined into higher-order strains without lethal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lajoie | first1 = MJ | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Genomically Recoded Organisms Expand Biological Functions | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6156| pages = 357–60 | doi=10.1126/science.1241459 | pmid=24136966 | pmc=4924538| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..357L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this genome wide codon replacement, the authors continued and achieved the reprogramming of 13 codons throughout the genome, directly affecting 42 essential genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lajoie | first1 = MJ | last2 = Kosuri | first2 = S | last3 = Mosberg | first3 = JA | last4 = Gregg | first4 = CJ | last5 = Zhang | first5 = D | last6 = Church | first6 = GM | year = 2013 | title = Probing the Limits of Genetic Recoding in Essential Genes | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6156| pages = 361–63 | doi=10.1126/science.1241460 | pmid=24136967| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..361L | s2cid = 3211613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An even more radical change in the genetic code is the change of a triplet codon to a quadruplet and even quintuplet codon pioneered by Sisido in cell-free systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hohsaka | first1 = T | last2 = Sisido | first2 = M | year = 2002 | title = Incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins | journal = Curr.

===Directed evolution===
{{Main|Directed evolution}}

The goal of substituting DNA by XNA may also be reached by another route, namely by engineering the environment instead of the genetic modules. This approach has been successfully demonstrated by Marlière and Mutzel with the production of an ''E. coli'' strain whose DNA is composed of standard A, C and G nucleotides but has the synthetic thymine analogue 5-chlorouracil instead of thymine (T) in the corresponding positions of the sequence. These cells are then dependent on externally supplied 5-chlorouracil for growth, but otherwise they look and behave as normal ''E. coli''. These cells, however, are currently not yet fully auxotrophic for the Xeno-base since they are still growing on thymine when this is supplied to the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marlière | first1 = P. |display-authors=etal | year = 2011 | title = Chemical Evolution of a Bacterium's Genome | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/312248| journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 50 | issue = 31| pages = 7109–14 | doi=10.1002/anie.201100535| pmid = 21710668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosafety==
Xenobiological systems are designed to convey orthogonality to natural biological systems. A (still hypothetical) organism that uses XNA,&lt;ref&gt;Herdewijn, P. and Marlière, P. (2009) Toward safe genetically modified organisms through the chemical diversification of nucleic acids. Chem. Biodivers. 6, 791–808&lt;/ref&gt; different base pairs and polymerases and has an altered genetic code will hardly be able to interact with natural forms of life on the genetic level. Thus, these xenobiological organisms represent a genetic enclave that cannot exchange information with natural cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marlière | first1 = P | year = 2009 | title = The farther, the safer: a manifesto for securely navigating synthetic species away from the old living world | journal = Syst.

In analogy to information processing in IT, this safety concept is termed a “genetic firewall”.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acevedo-Rocha | first1 = CG | last2 = Budisa | first2 = N | year = 2011 | title = On the Road towards Chemically Modified Organisms Endowed with a Genetic Firewall | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 50 | issue = 31| pages = 6960–62 | doi=10.1002/anie.201103010 | pmid=21710510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the genetic firewall seems to overcome a number of limitations of previous safety systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moe-Behrens | first1 = GH | last2 = Davis | first2 = R | last3 = Haynes | first3 = KA | year = 2013 | title = Preparing synthetic biology for the world | journal = Front Microbiol | volume = 4 | page = 5 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00005 | pmid = 23355834 | pmc = 3554958 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = O | last2 = Stan | first2 = GB | last3 = Ellis | first3 = T | year = 2013 | title = Building-in biosafety for synthetic biology | url = http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/mic.0.066308-0.full.pdf+html | journal = Microbiology | volume = 159 | issue = 7| pages = 1221–35 | doi=10.1099/mic.0.066308-0 | pmid=23519158| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A first experimental evidence of the theoretical concept of the genetic firewall was achieved in 2013 with the construction of a genomically recoded organism (GRO). In this GRO all known UAG stop codons in E.coli were replaced by UAA codons, which allowed for the deletion of release factor 1 and reassignment of UAG translation function. The GRO exhibited increased resistance to T7 bacteriophage, thus showing that alternative genetic codes do reduce genetic compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lajoie | first1 = MJ | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Genomically Recoded Organisms Expand Biological Functions | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6156| pages = 357–60 | doi=10.1126/science.1241459 | pmid=24136966 | pmc=4924538| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..357L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This GRO, however, is still very similar to its natural “parent” and cannot be regarded as a genetic firewall. The possibility of reassigning the function of large number of triplets opens the perspective to have strains that combine XNA, novel base pairs, new genetic codes, etc. that cannot exchange any information with the natural biological world.
Regardless of changes leading to a semantic containment mechanism in new organisms, any novel biochemical systems still has to undergo a toxicological screening. XNA, novel proteins, etc. might represent novel toxins, or have an allergic potential that needs to be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt M, Pei L. 2011. [http://www.markusschmidt.eu/pdf/11_03-ToxSci-Schmidt-Pei.pdf Synthetic Toxicology: Where engineering meets biology and toxicology] ''Toxicological Sciences'' 120(S1), S204–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt M. 2013.

==Governance and regulatory issues==
Xenobiology might challenge the regulatory framework, as currently laws and directives deal with genetically modified organisms and do not directly mention chemically or genomically modified organisms. Taking into account that real xenobiology organisms are not expected in the next few years, policy makers do have some time at hand to prepare themselves for an upcoming governance challenge. Since 2012, the following groups have picked up the topic as a developing governance issue: policy advisers in the US,&lt;ref&gt;ISGP. 2013.

      <text bytes="1666" xml:space="preserve">'''Xenohormesis''' is a hypothesis that posits that certain molecules such as plant [[polyphenol]]s, which indicate [[Stress (biology)|stress]] in the plants, can have a longevity-conferring effect in consumers of plants (i.e. [[mammals]]) and studies that relationship. It was first used in the paper "Small molecules that regulate lifespan: evidence for xenohormesis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamming |first1=Dudley W. |last2=Wood |first2=Jason G. |last3=Sinclair |first3=David A. |title=Small molecules that regulate lifespan: evidence for xenohormesis |journal=Molecular Microbiology |date=16 July 2004 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=1003–1009 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04209.x |pmid=15306006 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/df2808b38be6a75089b01b46b19920b455229a04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] and colleagues from the [[Harvard Medical School]].

If the plants an animal is eating are under stress, their increased polyphenol content may signal forthcoming [[famine]] conditions. It could be advantageous for the animal to begin to react—i.e. to [[wikt:hunker down|hunker down]] to prepare for the lean times to come. The effects researchers have observed from [[resveratrol]] may be just such a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sajish |first1=Mathew |last2=Schimmel |first2=Paul |title=A human tRNA synthetase is a potent PARP1-activating effector target for resveratrol |journal=Nature |date=March 2015 |volume=519 |issue=7543 |pages=370–373 |doi=10.1038/nature14028 |pmid=25533949 |pmc=4368482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[extremophile|extremophilic]] organism that can grow and reproduce in conditions with a low availability of water, also known as [[water activity]]. Water activity (a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured as the humidity above a substance relative to the humidity above pure water (Aw = 1.0). Xerophiles are "xerotolerant", meaning tolerant of dry conditions. They can often survive in environments with water activity below 0.8; above which is typical for most life on Earth.  Typically xerotolerance is used with respect to matric drying, where a substance has a low water concentration.  These environments include arid desert soils.  The term [[osmotolerance]] is typically applied to organisms that can grow in solutions with high solute concentrations (salts, sugars), such as [[halophiles]].

The common [[Food preservation#Drying|food preservation]] method of reducing water ([[food drying]]) activities may not prevent the growth of xerophilic organisms, often resulting in [[food spoilage]].  Some [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[yeast]] species are xerophilic. Mold growth on bread is an example of food spoilage by xerophilic organisms.{{Cn|date=October 2022}}

{{distinguish|z-score|z-value}}
{{about|the Z-factor in statistics|the gas compressibility factor|Compressibility factor}}

The '''Z-factor''' is a measure of [[statistics|statistical]] [[effect size]].  It has been proposed for use in [[high-throughput screening]] (where it is also known as Z-prime&lt;ref&gt;http://planetorbitrap.com/data/uploads/4fb692e73c07b.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and commonly written as Z' to judge whether the response in a particular [[assay]] is large enough to warrant further attention.

==Background==
In high-throughput screens, experimenters often compare a large number (hundreds of thousands to tens of millions) of single measurements of unknown samples to positive and negative [[scientific control|control]] samples.  The particular choice of experimental conditions and measurements is called an assay.  Large screens are expensive in time and resources.  Therefore, prior to starting a large screen, smaller test (or pilot) screens are used to assess the quality of an assay, in an attempt to predict if it would be useful in a high-throughput setting.  The Z-factor is an attempt to quantify the suitability of a particular assay for use in a full-scale, high-throughput screen.

==Definition==
The  Z-factor is defined in terms of four parameters: the [[expected value|mean]]s (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) and [[standard deviation]]s (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) of both the positive (p) and negative (n) controls (&lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;). Given these values, the Z-factor is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Z-factor} = 1 - {3 (\sigma_p + \sigma_n) \over | \mu_p - \mu_n |}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, the Z-factor is estimated from the [[arithmetic mean|sample mean]]s and sample standard deviations

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Estimated Z-factor} = 1 - {3 (\hat{\sigma}_p + \hat{\sigma}_n) \over | \hat{\mu}_p - \hat{\mu}_n |}&lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretation==
The following interpretations for the Z-factor are taken from:&lt;ref name=ZhangJHetal1999&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang JH, ((Chung TDY)), Oldenburg KR
|title=A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays 
|journal=Journal of Biomolecular Screening  |volume=4 |pages=67–73 
|year=1999 |pmid=10838414 |doi=10.1177/108705719900400206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
! Z-factor !! Interpretation
|-
|1.0||Ideal.  Z-factors can never exceed 1.
|-
|between 0.5 and 1.0||An excellent assay.  Note that if &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p = \sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;, 0.5 is equivalent to a separation of '''12''' standard deviations between &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt;.
|-
|between 0 and 0.5||A marginal assay.
|-
|less than 0||There is too much overlap between the positive and negative controls for the assay to be useful.
|}

Note that by the standards of many types of experiments, a zero Z-factor would suggest a large effect size, rather than a borderline useless result as suggested above.  For example, if σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=1, then μ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=6 and μ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=0 gives a zero Z-factor.  But for normally-distributed data with these parameters, the probability that the positive control value would be less than the negative control value is less than 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.  Extreme conservatism is used in high throughput screening due to the large number of tests performed.

==Limitations==
The constant factor 3 in the definition of the Z-factor is motivated by the [[normal distribution]], for which more than 99% of values occur within 3 standard deviations of the mean.  If the data follow a strongly non-normal distribution, the reference points (e.g. the meaning of a negative value) may be misleading.  Another issue is that the usual estimates of the mean and standard deviation are not [[robust statistics|robust]]; accordingly many users in the high-throughput screening community prefer the "Robust Z-prime" which substitutes the median for the mean and the median absolute deviation for the standard deviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Birmingham, Amanda|title= Statistical Methods for Analysis of High-Throughput RNA Interference Screens

In addition, the application of the single Z-factor-based criterion to two or more positive controls with different strengths in the same assay will lead to misleading results

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}
'''Zinc-finger nucleases''' ('''ZFNs''') are artificial [[restriction enzymes]] generated by fusing a [[zinc finger]] [[DNA-binding domain]] to a [[nuclease|DNA-cleavage domain]].   Zinc finger domains can be engineered to target specific desired [[DNA]] sequences and this enables zinc-finger nucleases to target unique sequences within complex [[genome]]s.  By taking advantage of endogenous DNA repair machinery, these reagents can be used to precisely alter the genomes of higher organisms. Alongside [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] and [[TALEN]], ZFN is a prominent tool in the field of [[genome editing]].

==Domains==
=== DNA-binding domain ===
The DNA-binding domains of individual ZFNs typically contain between three and six individual [[zinc finger]] repeats and can each recognize between 9 and 18 basepairs.  If the zinc finger domains perfectly recognize a 3 basepair DNA sequence, they can generate a 3-finger array that can recognize a 9 basepair target site.  Other procedures can utilize either 1-finger or 2-finger modules to generate zinc-finger arrays with six or more individual zinc fingers.  The main drawback with this procedure is the specificities of individual zinc fingers can overlap and can depend on the context of the surrounding zinc fingers and DNA.  Without methods to account for this "context dependence", the standard modular assembly procedure often fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramirez CL, Foley JE, Wright DA |title=Unexpected failure rates for modular assembly of engineered zinc fingers |journal=Nat. Methods |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=374–375 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18446154 |doi=10.1038/nmeth0508-374 |display-authors=etal|pmc=7880305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous selection methods have been used to generate zinc-finger arrays capable of targeting desired sequences.  Initial selection efforts utilized [[phage display]] to select proteins that bound a given DNA target from a large pool of partially randomized zinc-finger arrays.  More recent efforts have utilized yeast one-hybrid systems, bacterial one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, and mammalian cells.  A promising new method to select novel zinc-finger arrays utilizes a bacterial two-hybrid system and has been dubbed "OPEN" by its creators.&lt;ref&gt;

| display-authors=etal
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system combines pre-selected pools of individual zinc fingers that were each selected to bind a given triplet and then utilizes a second round of selection to obtain 3-finger arrays capable of binding a desired 9-bp sequence.  This system was developed by the Zinc-Finger Consortium as an alternative to commercial sources of engineered zinc-finger arrays.

(see: [[Zinc finger chimera]] for more info on zinc finger selection techniques)

=== DNA-cleavage domain ===
[[File:Repair outcomes of a genomic double-strand break for ZFN cleavage.jpg|thumb|A pair of ZFNs, each with three zinc fingers binding to target DNA, are shown introducing a double-strand break, at the FokI domain, depicted in yellow. Subsequently, the double strand break is shown as being repaired through either [[homology-directed repair]] or [[non-homologous end joining]].&lt;ref name="genomeengineering"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Carroll D|year=2011|title=Genome engineering with zinc-finger nucleases|journal= Genetics|volume=188|issue=4|pages=773–782|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.131433|pmc=3176093|pmid=21828278}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The non-specific cleavage domain from the type IIs [[restriction endonuclease]] [[FokI]] is typically used as the cleavage domain in ZFNs.&lt;ref name="kim1996"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Kim YG, Cha J, Chandrasegaran S | year=1996| title=Hybrid restriction enzymes: zinc finger fusions to Fok I cleavage domain| journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA| volume= 93| issue=3| pages=1156–1160 | doi=10.1073/pnas.93.3.1156| pmid=8577732| pmc=40048|bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.1156K | doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
This cleavage domain must dimerize in order to cleave DNA&lt;ref name="bitinaite1998"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Bitinaite J, Wah, DA, Aggarwal AK, Schildkraut I | year=1998| title=FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage| journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA| volume= 95| issue=18| pages=10570–10575 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.18.10570| pmid=9724744| pmc=27935|bibcode = 1998PNAS...9510570B | doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and thus a pair of ZFNs are required to target non-palindromic DNA sites. Standard ZFNs fuse the cleavage domain to the C-terminus of each zinc finger domain. To let the two cleavage domains dimerize and cleave DNA, the two individual ZFNs must bind opposite strands of DNA with their C-termini a certain distance apart.  The most commonly used linker sequences between the zinc finger domain and the cleavage domain requires the 5′ edge of each binding site to be separated by 5 to 7 bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cathomen T, Joung JK |title=Zinc-finger nucleases: the next generation emerges |journal=Mol.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different [[protein engineering]] techniques have been employed to improve both the activity and specificity of the nuclease domain used in ZFNs.

=== Disabling an allele ===
ZFNs can be used to disable dominant mutations in heterozygous individuals by producing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA (see [[Genetic recombination]]) in the mutant allele, which will, in the absence of a homologous template, be repaired by [[non-homologous end-joining]] (NHEJ). NHEJ repairs DSBs by joining the two ends together and usually produces no mutations, provided that the cut is clean and uncomplicated. In some instances, however, the repair is imperfect, resulting in deletion or insertion of base-pairs, producing [[frame-shift]] and preventing the production of the harmful protein.&lt;ref name="durai" /&gt; Multiple pairs of ZFNs can also be used to completely remove entire large segments of genomic sequence.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To monitor the editing activity, a PCR of the target area amplifies both alleles and, if one contains an insertion, deletion, or mutation, it results in a heteroduplex single-strand bubble that cleavage assays can easily detect.
ZFNs have also been used to modify disease-causing alleles in triplet repeat disorders. Expanded CAG/CTG repeat tracts are the genetic basis for more than a dozen inherited neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy, and several spinocerebellar ataxias. It has been demonstrated in human cells that ZFNs can direct double-strand breaks (DSBs) to CAG repeats and shrink the repeat from long pathological lengths to short, less toxic lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mittelman D, Moye C, Morton J, Sykoudis K, Lin Y, Carroll D, Wilson JH |title=Zinc-finger directed double-strand breaks within CAG repeat tracts promote repeat instability in human cells|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=16 June 2009|volume=106|issue=24|pages=9607–9612|pmid=19482946|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902420106|pmc=2701052|bibcode = 2009PNAS..106.9607M |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a group of researchers have successfully applied the ZFN technology to genetically modify the gol pigment gene and the ntl gene in zebrafish embryo. Specific zinc-finger motifs were engineered to recognize distinct DNA sequences.  The ZFN-encoding mRNA was injected into one-cell embryos and a high percentage of animals carried the desired mutations and phenotypes. Their research work demonstrated that ZFNs can specifically and efficiently create heritable mutant alleles at loci of interest in the germ line, and ZFN-induced alleles can be propagated in subsequent generations.

Similar research of using ZFNs to create specific mutations in zebrafish embryo has also been carried out by other research groups. The kdr gene in zebra fish encodes for the vascular endothelial growth factor-2 receptor. Mutagenic lesions at this target site was induced using ZFN technique by a group of researchers in US. They suggested that the ZFN technique allows straightforward generation of a targeted allelic series of mutants; it does not rely on the existence of species-specific embryonic stem cell lines and is applicable to other vertebrates, especially those whose embryos are easily available; finally, it is also feasible to achieve targeted knock-ins in zebrafish, therefore it is possible to create human disease models that are heretofore inaccessible.

=== Allele editing ===
ZFNs are also used to rewrite the sequence of an allele by invoking the [[homologous recombination]] (HR) machinery to repair the DSB using the supplied DNA fragment as a template. The HR machinery searches for homology between the damaged chromosome and the extra-chromosomal fragment and copies the sequence of the fragment between the two broken ends of the chromosome, regardless of whether the fragment contains the original sequence. If the subject is homozygous for the target allele, the efficiency of the technique is reduced since the undamaged copy of the allele may be used as a template for repair instead of the supplied fragment.

===Gene therapy===
The success of gene therapy depends on the efficient insertion of therapeutic [[gene]]s at an appropriate [[chromosome|chromosomal]] target site within the human [[genome]], without causing cell injury, [[oncogenesis|oncogenic]] mutations, or an [[immune response]]. The construction of [[plasmid]] [[Plasmid#Vectors|vector]]s is simple and straightforward. Custom-designed ZFNs that combine the non-specific cleavage domain (N) of ''Fok''I endonuclease with zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) offer a general way to deliver a site-specific DSB to the genome, and stimulate local homologous recombination by several orders of magnitude. This makes targeted gene correction or genome editing a viable option in human cells. Since ZFN-encoding plasmids could be used to transiently express ZFNs to target a DSB to a specific gene locus in human cells, they offer an excellent way for targeted delivery of the therapeutic genes to a pre-selected chromosomal site. The ZFN-encoding plasmid-based approach has the potential to circumvent all the problems associated with the viral delivery of therapeutic genes.&lt;ref name="Kandavelou"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kandavelou K, Chandrasegaran S |year=2008|chapter=Plasmids for Gene Therapy|title=Plasmids: Current Research and Future Trends|publisher=Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk | isbn= 978-1-904455-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first therapeutic applications of ZFNs are likely to involve ''ex vivo'' therapy using a patients own stem cells. After editing the stem cell genome, the cells could be expanded in culture and reinserted into the patient to produce differentiated cells with corrected functions. Initial targets likely include the causes of monogenic diseases, such as the IL2Rγ gene and the β-globin gene for gene correction and CCR5 gene for mutagenesis and disablement.&lt;ref name="durai" /&gt;

== Potential problems ==
=== Off-target cleavage ===
If the zinc finger domains are not specific enough for their target site or they do not target a unique site within the genome of interest, off-target cleavage may occur.  Such off-target cleavage may lead to the production of enough double-strand breaks to overwhelm the repair machinery and, as a consequence, yield chromosomal rearrangements and/or cell death.  Off-target cleavage events may also promote random integration of donor DNA.&lt;ref name="durai"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Durai S, Mani M, Kandavelou K, Wu J, Porteus MH, Chandrasegaran S |title=Zinc finger nucleases: custom-designed molecular scissors for genome engineering of plant and mammalian cells |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=33 |issue=18 |pages=5978–5990 |year=2005 |pmid=16251401 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki912 |pmc=1270952}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two separate methods have been demonstrated to decrease off-target cleavage for 3-finger ZFNs that target two adjacent 9-basepair sites.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta A, Meng X, Zhu LJ, Lawson ND, Wolfe SA |title=Zinc finger protein-dependent and -independent contributions to the in vivo off-target activity of zinc finger nucleases |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume= 39|issue= 1|pages= 381–392|date=September 2010 |pmid=20843781 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkq787 |pmc=3017618}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other groups use ZFNs with 4, 5 or 6 zinc fingers that target longer and presumably rarer sites and such ZFNs could theoretically yield less off-target activity.  A comparison of a pair of 3-finger ZFNs and a pair of 4-finger ZFNs detected off-target cleavage in human cells at 31 loci for the 3-finger ZFNs and at 9 loci for the 4-finger ZFNs.&lt;ref name="Pattanayak2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Pattanayak V, Ramirez CL, Joung JK, Liu DR | title = Revealing Off-Target Cleavage Specificities of Zinc Finger Nucleases by in Vitro Selection | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 765–770 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21822273 | pmc = 3164905 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole genome sequencing of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' modified with a pair of 5-finger ZFNs found only the intended modification and a deletion at a site "unrelated to the ZFN site" indicating this pair of ZFNs was capable of targeting a unique site in the ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' genome.&lt;ref name="Wood2011" /&gt;

=== Immunogenicity ===
{{details|Adaptive immune response}}

As with many foreign proteins inserted into the human body, there is a risk of an immunological response against the therapeutic agent and the cells in which it is active. Since the protein must be expressed only transiently, however, the time over which a response may develop is short.&lt;ref name="durai" /&gt;

== Prospects ==
The ability to precisely manipulate the genomes of plants and animals has numerous applications in basic research, agriculture, and human therapeutics. Using ZFNs to modify endogenous genes has traditionally been a difficult task due mainly to the challenge of generating zinc finger domains that target the desired sequence with sufficient specificity.

== Zinc-finger nickases ==
Zinc-finger nickases (ZFNickases) are created by inactivating the catalytic activity of one ZFN monomer in the ZFN dimer required for double-strand cleavage.&lt;ref name="RamirezA"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Ramirez CL, Certo MT, Mussolino C, Goodwin MJ, Cradick TJ, McCaffrey AP, Cathomen T, Scharenberg AM, Joung JK | year = 2012 | title = Engineered zinc finger nickases induce homology-directed repair with reduced mutagenic effects | journal = Nucleic Acids Research| pages = 5560–5568 | volume = 40 | issue = 7 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks179 | pmid=22373919 | pmc=3384306}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZFNickases demonstrate strand-specific nicking activity ''in vitro'' and thus provide for highly specific single-strand breaks in DNA.&lt;ref name="RamirezA" /&gt; These SSBs undergo the same cellular mechanisms for DNA that ZFNs exploit, but they show a significantly reduced frequency of mutagenic NHEJ repairs at their target nicking site. This reduction provides a bias for HR-mediated gene modifications. ZFNickases can induce targeted HR in cultured human and livestock cells, although at lower levels than corresponding ZFNs from which they were derived because nicks can be repaired without genetic alteration.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Wang J, Friedman G, Doyon Y, Wang NS, Li CJ, Miller JC, Hua KL, Yan JE, Babiarz PD, Gregory PD, Holmes MC | title = Targeted gene addition to a predetermined site in the human genome using a ZFN-based nicking enzyme | journal = Genome Research| pages = 1316–1326| year = 2012 | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1101/gr.122879.111 | pmid=22434427 | pmc=3396372}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major limitation of ZFN-mediated gene modifications is the competition between NHEJ and HR repair pathways. Regardless of the presence of a DNA donor construct, both repair mechanisms can be activated following DSBs induced by ZFNs. Thus, ZFNickases is the first plausible attempt at engineering a method to favor the HR method of DNA repair as opposed to the error-prone NHEJ repair. By reducing NHEJ repairs, ZFNickases can thereby reduce the spectrum of unwanted off-target alterations. The ease by which ZFNickases can be derive from ZFNs provides a great platform for further studies regarding the optimization of ZFNickases and possibly increasing their levels of targeted HR while still maintain their reduced NHEJ frequency.

Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A [[coordinate covalent bond]] is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a [[hydrophobic]] pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p1224—1225" /&gt;

== Signalling ==
Zinc has been recognized as a messenger, able to activate signalling pathways. Many of these pathways provide the driving force in aberrant cancer growth. They can be targeted through [[Zinc transporter protein|ZIP transporters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ziliotto |first1=Silvia |title=Metallo-Drugs: Development and Action of Anticancer Agents |last2=Ogle |first2=Olivia |last3=Yaylor |first3=Kathryn M. |date=2018 |journal=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |publisher=de Gruyter GmbH |isbn=9783110470734 |editor1-last=Sigel |editor1-first=Astrid |volume=18 |location=Berlin |pages=507–529 |chapter=Chapter 17.

Zinc serves a purely structural role in [[Zinc finger|zinc fingers]], twists and clusters.&lt;ref name="Cotton1997p628"&gt;{{harvnb|Cotton et al.|1999|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc fingers form parts of some [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]], which are proteins that recognize [[DNA sequence|DNA base sequences]] during the replication and transcription of [[DNA]].

In [[blood plasma]], zinc is bound to and transported by [[albumin]] (60%, low-affinity) and [[transferrin]] (10%).&lt;ref name="Rink2000" /&gt; Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa.

== Nutrition ==

=== Dietary recommendations ===
The [[U.S. Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zinc in 2001. The current EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up is 6.8 and 9.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. RDA for lactation is 12&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8&amp;nbsp;mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level|Tolerable upper intake levels]] (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of zinc the adult UL is 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day (lower for children). Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake|Dietary Reference Intakes]] (DRIs).&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the [[phytate]] content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7&amp;nbsp;mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200&amp;nbsp;mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3&amp;nbsp;mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref name="EFSA"&gt;{{cite web |year=2017 |title=Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |archive-date=August 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25&amp;nbsp;mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf |df=mdy-all |year=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316225123/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf |publisher=European Food Safety Authority |archive-date=March 16, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).

==History==
Two of the drug's three components were originally developed at the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), and a third at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases;&lt;ref name=Branswell2014/&gt; the cocktail was optimized by Gary Kobinger, then branch chief of the NML, and is undergoing further development by Leaf Biopharmaceutical (LeafBio, Inc.), a San Diego-based arm of Mapp Biopharmaceutical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=15 July 2014 |url=http://www.leafbio.com/zmab.pdf |title=Monoclonal antibody-based filovirus therapeutic licensed to Leaf Biopharmaceutical}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LeafBio created ZMapp in collaboration with its parent and Defyrus Inc., each of which had licensed its own cocktail of antibodies, called MB-003 and ZMab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |display-authors=3 |vauthors=Davidson E, Bryan C, Fong RH, Barnes T, Pfaff JM, Mabila M, Rucker JB, Doranz BJ |date=November 2015 |title=Mechanism of Binding to Ebola Virus Glycoprotein by the ZMapp, ZMAb, and MB-003 Cocktail Antibodies |journal=J.

===MB-003===
MB-003 is a cocktail of three humanized or human–mouse chimeric mAbs: c13C6, h13F6, and c6D8.&lt;ref name=Nature2014/&gt; A study published in September 2012 found that [[rhesus macaques]] infected with [[Ebola virus]] (EBOV) survived when receiving MB-003 (mixture of 3 chimeric monoclonal antibodies) one hour after infection. When treated 24 or 48 hours after infection, four of six animals survived and had little to no [[viremia]] and few, if any, clinical symptoms.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |display-authors=3 |vauthors=Olinger GG, Pettitt J, Kim D, Working C, Bohorov O, Bratcher B, Hiatt E, Hume SD, Johnson AK, Morton J, Pauly M, Whaley KJ, Lear CM, Biggins JE, Scully C, Hensley L, Zeitlin L |date=October 2012 |title=Delayed treatment of Ebola virus infection with plant-derived monoclonal antibodies provides protection in rhesus macaques |journal=Proc.

MB-003 was created by scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Gene Olinger, and Jamie Pettitt in collaboration with Mapp Biopharmaceutical with years of funding from US government agencies including the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease]], [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]], and the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]].&lt;ref name=Kroll&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Kroll |work=Forbes |date=5 August 2014|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2014/08/05/ebola-secret-serum-small-biopharma-the-army-and-big-tobacco/ |title=Ebola 'Secret Serum': Small Biopharma, The Army, And Big Tobacco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Branswell2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=29 August 2014 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/qa-experimental-treatments.html |title=Questions and answers on experimental treatments and vaccines for Ebola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ZMAb===
ZMAb is a mixture of three mouse mAbs: m1H3, m2G4, and m4G7.&lt;ref name=Nature2014/&gt; A study published in November 2013 found that EBOV-infected [[macaque]] monkeys survived after being given a therapy with a combination of three EBOV surface [[glycoprotein]] (EBOV-GP)-specific monoclonal antibodies (ZMAb) within 24 hours of infection. The authors concluded that post-exposure treatment resulted in a robust immune response, with good protection for up to 10 weeks and some protection at 13 weeks.&lt;ref name="ZMAbStudy"&gt;{{Cite journal |display-authors=3 |vauthors=Qiu X, Audet J, Wong G, Fernando L, Bello A, Pillet S, Alimonti JB, Kobinger GP |date=November 2013 |title=Sustained protection against Ebola virus infection following treatment of infected nonhuman primates with ZMAb |journal=Sci Rep |volume=3 |pages=3365 |doi=10.1038/srep03365 |pmc=3842534 |pmid=24284388|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E3365Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; ZMab was created by the NML and licensed to Defyrus, a Toronto-based [[biodefense]] company, with further funding by the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Branswell2014/&gt;

===ZMapp===
A 2014 paper described how Mapp and its collaborators, including investigators at [[Public Health Agency of Canada]], Kentucky BioProcessing, and the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]], first [[chimeric antibody|chimerized]] the three antibodies comprising ZMAb, then tested combinations of MB-003 and the chimeric ZMAb antibodies in guinea pigs and then primates to determine the best combination, which turned out to be c13C6 from MB-003 and two chimeric mAbs from ZMAb, c2G4 and c4G7.  This is ZMapp.&lt;ref name="Nature2014"&gt;{{Cite journal |display-authors=3 |vauthors=Qiu X, Wong G, Audet J, Bello A, Fernando L, Alimonti JB, Fausther-Bovendo H, Wei H, Aviles J, Hiatt E, Johnson A, Morton J, Swope K, Bohorov O, Bohorova N, Goodman C, Kim D, Pauly MH, Velasco J, Pettitt J, Olinger GG, Whaley K, Xu B, Strong JE, Zeitlin L, Kobinger GP |date=October 2014 |title=Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp |journal=Nature |volume=514 |issue=7520 |pages=47–53 |doi=10.1038/nature13777 |pmc=4214273 |pmid=25171469|bibcode=2014Natur.514...47Q }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment also published in the 2014 paper, 21 [[rhesus macaque]] primates were infected with the [[Kikwit]] Congolese variant of EBOV.  Three primates in the control arm were given a non-functional antibody, and the 18 in the treatment arm were divided into three groups of six.  All primates in the treatment arm received three doses of ZMapp, spaced 3 days apart.  The first treatment group received its first dose on 3rd day after being infected; the second group on the 4th day after being infected, and the third group, on the 5th day after being infected.  All three primates in the control group died; all 18 primates in the treatment arm survived.&lt;ref name=Nature2014/&gt;  Mapp then went on to show that ZMapp inhibits replication of a Guinean strain of EBOV in cell cultures.&lt;ref name=NatureNews2014&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geisbert TW |title=Medical research: Ebola therapy protects severely ill monkeys |journal=Nature |volume= 514|issue= 7520|pages= 41–43| date=August 2014 |pmid=25171470 |pmc=4469351 |doi=10.1038/nature13746|bibcode=2014Natur.514...41G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mapp remains involved in the production of the drug through its contracts with Kentucky BioProcessing, a subsidiary of [[Reynolds American]].&lt;ref name=Kroll/&gt;  To produce the drug, genes coding for the chimeric mAbs were inserted into [[viral vectors]], and tobacco plants are infected with the viral vector encoding for the antibodies, using ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnifection – mass-producing drugs in record time |url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2008/08/16/magnifection-mass-producing-drugs-in-record-time/ |publisher=National Geographic|access-date=11 September 2014|date=2008-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |vauthors=Whaley KJ, etal |title=Plant Viral Vectors |chapter=Emerging antibody-based products |journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |year=2014 |volume=375 |pages=107–26 |pmid=22772797 |doi=10.1007/82_2012_240|series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |isbn=978-3-642-40828-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |display-authors=3 |vauthors=Giritch A, Marillonnet S, Engler C, van Eldik G, Botterman J, Klimyuk V, Gleba Y |date=October 2006 |title=Rapid high-yield expression of full-size IgG antibodies in plants coinfected with noncompeting viral vectors |journal=Proc.

==Use during the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa==
{{see also|Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa}}

ZMapp was first used during the 2014 West Africa Ebola Virus outbreak, having not previously undergone any human clinical trials to determine its efficacy or potential risks.&lt;ref name="NYTwho" /&gt; By October 2014, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] had approved the use of several experimental drugs, including ZMapp, to be used on patients infected with Ebola virus. The use of such drugs during the epidemic was also deemed ethical by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/23/world/africa/ebola-drugs.html|title=Treating Ebola: The Hunt for a Drug|last=Lai|first=K.

===Controversy===
The lack of drugs and unavailability of experimental treatment in the most affected regions of the West African Ebola virus outbreak spurred some controversy.&lt;ref name=NYTwho/&gt;  The fact that the drug was first given to Americans and a European and not to Africans, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "provoked outrage, feeding into African perceptions of Western insensitivity and arrogance, with a deep sense of mistrust and betrayal still lingering over the exploitation and abuses of the colonial era".&lt;ref name=LAtimes/&gt;  [[Salim Abdool Karim|Salim S. Abdool Karim]], the director of an AIDS research center in South Africa, placed the issue in the context of the history of exploitation and abuses. Responding to a question on how people might have reacted if ZMapp and other drugs had first been used on Africans, he said "It would have been the front-page screaming headline: 'Africans used as guinea pigs for American drug company's medicine{{' "}}.&lt;ref name=NYTwho/&gt;

In early August, the World Health Organization called for convening a panel of medical authorities "to consider whether experimental drugs should be more widely released." In a statement, [[Peter Piot]] (co-discoverer of the Ebola virus); Jeremy Farrar, the director of the [[Wellcome Trust]]; and David Heymann of the Chatham House Center on Global Health Security, called for the release of experimental drugs for [[2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak|affected African nations]].&lt;ref name="LAtimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|author-link=Robyn Dixon (journalist)|date=6 August 2014|title=Three leading Ebola experts call for release of experimental drug|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Johannesburg|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-three-ebola-experts-release-drugs-20140806-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an August 6, 2014 press conference, [[Barack Obama]], the [[President of the United States]], was questioned regarding whether the cocktail should be fast-tracked for approval or be made available to sick patients outside of the United States. He responded, "I think we've got to let the science guide us. I don't think all the information's in on whether this drug is helpful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 August 2014|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/obama-premature-say-u-s-should-green-light-new-ebola-n174461|title=Obama: 'Premature' to say U.S. should green-light new Ebola drug |publisher=NBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical trial==

As a result, although a 40% lower risk of death was calculated for those who received ZMapp, the difference was not statistically significant and ultimately it could not be determined whether the use of ZMapp was superior to the optimized standard of care alone. However, ZMapp was found to be safe and well tolerated.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bixler|first1=Sandra L.|last2=Duplantier|first2=Allen J.|last3=Bavari|first3=Sina|date=2017|title=Discovering Drugs for the Treatment of Ebola Virus|journal=Current Treatment Options in Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=299–317|doi=10.1007/s40506-017-0130-z|issn=1534-6250|pmid=28890666|pmc=5570806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |display-authors=3 |vauthors=Davey RT, Dodd L, Proschan MA, Neaton J, Neuhaus Nordwall J, Koopmeiners JS, Beigel J, Tierney J, Lane HC, Fauci AS, Massaquoi MB, Sahr F, Malvy D |date=October 2016 |title=A Randomized, Controlled Trial of ZMapp for Ebola Virus Infection |journal=N.

The ZMapp cocktail was assessed by the World Health Organization for emergency use under the [[Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions|MEURI]] ethical protocol. The panel agreed that "the benefits of ZMapp outweigh its risks" while noting that it presented logistical challenges, particularly that of requiring a [[cold chain]] for distribution and storage.&lt;ref name=MEURI&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization |title=Notes for the record: Consultation on Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) |url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/ebola/MEURI-Ebola.pdf |date=17 May 2018 |access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four alternative therapies ([[remdesivir]], the [[Regeneron]] product [[atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab]], [[favipiravir]], and [[ansuvimab]]) were also considered for use, but they were at earlier stages of development.&lt;ref name=MEURI /&gt;
In August 2019, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's national health authorities, the World Health Organization, and the National Institutes of Health announced that they would stop using ZMapp, along with all other Ebola treatments except atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab and ansuvimab, in their ongoing clinical trials, citing the higher mortality rates of patients not treated with atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab and ansuvimab.&lt;ref name=McNeilNYT&gt;{{cite news | last=McNeil | first=Donald G.

'''Zoology''' ({{IPAc-en|z|oʊ|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i|}})&lt;ref group=note&gt;The pronunciation of zoology as {{IPAc-en|z|u|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} is usually regarded as nonstandard, though it is not uncommon.&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of [[biology]] that studies the [[Animal|animal kingdom]], including the [[anatomy|structure]], [[embryology]], [[evolution]], [[Biological classification|classification]], [[Ethology|habits]], and distribution of all animals, both living and [[extinction|extinct]], and how they interact with their [[ecosystem]]s. The term is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ζῷον}}, {{transl|grc|zōion}} ('animal'), and {{lang|grc|λόγος}}, {{lang|grc|logos}} ('knowledge', 'study').&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=zoology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zoology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although humans have always been interested in the natural history of the animals they saw around them, and made use of this knowledge to domesticate certain species, the formal study of zoology can be said to have originated with [[Aristotle]]. He viewed animals as living organisms, studied their structure and development, and considered their adaptations to their surroundings and the function of their parts. The Greek physician [[Galen]] studied human anatomy and was one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world, but after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the onset of the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Greek tradition of medicine and scientific study went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued in the [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic world]]. Modern zoology has its origins during the [[Renaissance]] and early modern period, with [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Gregor Mendel]] and many others.

The study of animals has largely moved on to deal with form and function, adaptations, relationships between groups, behaviour and ecology. Zoology has increasingly been subdivided into disciplines such as [[Taxonomy|classification]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[evolution]]. With the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Watson]] in 1953, the realm of [[molecular biology]] opened up, leading to advances in  [[cell biology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[molecular genetics]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of zoology through 1859|History of zoology (1859–present)}}
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Gessner Conrad 1516-1565.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Conrad Gessner]] (1516–1565). His ''[[Historia animalium (Gessner book)|Historiae animalium]]'' is considered the beginning of modern zoology.]]
The history of zoology traces the study of the [[animal|animal kingdom]] from ancient to modern times. Prehistoric people needed to study the animals and plants in their environment in order to exploit them and survive. There are cave paintings, engravings and sculptures in France dating back 15,000 years showing bison, horses and deer in carefully rendered detail. Similar images from other parts of the world illustrated mostly the animals hunted for food, but also the savage animals.&lt;ref name="Fellowes2020"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Fellowes|title=30-Second Zoology: The 50 most fundamental categories and concepts from the study of animal life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkzODwAAQBAJ|year=2020|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-0-7112-5465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neolithic Revolution]], which is characterized by the [[domestication of animals]], continued over the period of Antiquity. Ancient knowledge of wildlife is illustrated by the realistic depictions of wild and domestic animals in the Near East, Mesopotamia and Egypt, including husbandry practices and techniques, hunting and fishing. The invention of writing is reflected in zoology by the presence of animals in Egyptian hieroglyphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.um.es/cepoat/egipcio/wp-content/uploads/egyptianhierogly.pdf |title=Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary: Introduction |author=[[E. A. Wallis Budge]] |year=1920 |publisher=John Murray |accessdate=10 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of ''zoology'' as a single coherent field arose much later, the zoological sciences emerged from [[natural history]] reaching back to the [[Aristotle's biology|biological works of Aristotle]] and [[Galen]] in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]]. Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, looked at animals as living organisms, studying their structure, development and vital phenomena. He divided them into two groups: animals with blood, equivalent to our concept of [[Vertebrate|vertebrates]], and animals without blood, [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]]. He spent two years on [[Lesbos]], observing and describing the animals and plants, considering the adaptations of different organisms and the function of their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |date=2015 |author-link=Armand Marie Leroi |title-link=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four hundred years later, Roman physician Galen dissected animals to study their anatomy and the function of the different parts, because the dissection of human cadavers was prohibited at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudii Galeni Pergameni|title="That the best physician is also a philosopher" with a Modern Greek Translation

During the [[Post-classical history|post-classical era]], [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|Middle Eastern science and medicine]] was the most advanced in the world, integrating concepts from Ancient Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia and Persia as well as the ancient Indian tradition of [[Ayurveda]], while making numerous advances and innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mehmet |last=Bayrakdar |year=1986 |title=Al-Jahiz and the rise of biological evolution |journal=Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi |publisher=[[Ankara University]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=307–315 |doi=10.1501/Ilhfak_0000000674 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, [[Albertus Magnus]] produced commentaries and paraphrases of all Aristotle's works; his books on topics like [[botany]], zoology, and minerals included information from ancient sources, but also the results of his own investigations. His general approach was surprisingly modern, and he wrote, "For it is [the task] of natural science not simply to accept what we are told but to inquire into the causes of natural things."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/308059821ALBERTUSMAGNUSTheBookOfMinerals|title=Book of Minerals|last=Wyckoff|first=Dorothy|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1967|location=Oxford|pages=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early pioneer was [[Conrad Gessner]], whose monumental 4,500-page encyclopedia of animals, ''[[Historia animalium (Gessner book)|Historia animalium]]'', was published in four volumes between 1551 and 1558.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Michon|title=Conrad Gesner|url=https://www.strangescience.net/gesner.htm|website=Strange Science: The rocky road to modern paleontology and biology|access-date=27 September 2017|date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Galen's work on anatomy remained largely unsurpassed and unchallenged up until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking about Life: The History and Philosophy of Biology and Other Sciences|url=https://archive.org/details/thinkingaboutlif00agut_532 |author1=Agutter, Paul S. |author2=Wheatley, Denys N.  |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-8865-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/thinkingaboutlif00agut_532/page/n56 43]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Saint Albertus Magnus |title=On Animals: A Medieval Summa Zoologica |year=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-4823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Renaissance]] and early modern period, zoological thought was revolutionized in [[Europe]] by a renewed interest in [[empiricism]] and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were [[Andreas Vesalius]] and [[William Harvey]], who used experimentation and careful observation in [[physiology]], and naturalists such as [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] who began to [[Taxonomy (biology)|classify the diversity of life]] and the [[Fossil#Dating|fossil record]], as well as studying the development and behavior of organisms. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] did pioneering work in [[microscopy]] and revealed the previously unknown world of [[microorganism]]s, laying the groundwork for [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Magner, Lois N. |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=133–144 |isbn=0-8247-0824-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; van Leeuwenhoek's observations were endorsed by [[Robert Hooke]]; all living organisms were composed of one or more cells and could not generate spontaneously. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jan Sapp |title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 7 |isbn=0-19-515619-6 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/genesisevolution00sapp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having previously been the realm of gentlemen naturalists, over the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, zoology became an increasingly professional [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]]. Explorer-naturalists such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for [[biogeography]], [[ecology]] and [[ethology]]. Naturalists began to reject [[essentialism]] and consider the importance of [[extinction]] and the [[history of evolutionary thought|mutability of species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Coleman |title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 2 |isbn=0-521-29293-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments, as well as the results from [[embryology]] and [[paleontology]], were synthesized in the 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]; in this Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by explaining the processes by which it can occur, and providing observational evidence that it had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Coyne, Jerry A. |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-923084-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780199230846/page/17 17] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780199230846/page/17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darwinism|Darwin's theory]] was rapidly accepted by the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology. The basis for modern genetics began with the work of [[Gregor Mendel]] on peas in 1865, although the significance of his work was not realized at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Robin Marantz|title=The Monk in the Garden : The Lost and Found Genius of Gregor Mendel, the Father of Modern Genetics |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-395-97765-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/monkingardenlost00heni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin gave a new direction to [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]], by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a [[Genealogy|genealogical]] basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of [[spontaneous generation]] and the rise of the [[germ theory of disease]], though the mechanism of [[Heredity|inheritance]] remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work led to the rapid development of [[genetics]], and by the 1930s the combination of [[population genetics]] and natural selection in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] created [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science and Creationism: a view from the National Academy of Sciences |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencecreationi0000unse/page/28 |format=php |access-date=September 24, 2009 |edition=Second |year=1999 |publisher=The National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, DC |isbn=-0-309-06406-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencecreationi0000unse/page/28 28] |chapter=Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions |chapter-url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=27#p200064869970027001 |ref=NAS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in cell biology is interconnected to other fields such as genetics, [[biochemistry]], [[medical microbiology]], [[immunology]], and [[cytochemistry]]. With the sequencing of the [[DNA]] molecule by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Watson]] in 1953, the realm of [[molecular biology]] opened up, leading to advances in  [[cell biology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[molecular genetics]]. The study of [[systematics]] was transformed as [[DNA sequencing]] elucidated the degrees of affinity between different organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/systematics-meaning-branches-and-its-application/32374 |title=Systematics: Meaning, Branches and Its Application|date=27 May 2016|work=Biology Discussion|access-date=10 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Zoology is the branch of science dealing with [[animal]]s. A [[species]] can be defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sex can produce fertile offspring; about 1.5 million species of animal have been described and it has been estimated that as many as 8 million animal species may exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mora |first1=Camilo |last2=Tittensor |first2=Derek P. |last3=Adl |first3=Sina |last4=Simpson |first4=Alastair G.

An early necessity was to identify the organisms and group them according to their characteristics, differences and relationships, and this is the field of the [[taxonomy|taxonomist]]. Originally it was thought that species were immutable, but with the arrival of Darwin's theory of evolution, the field of [[cladistics]] came into being, studying the relationships between the different groups or [[clade]]s. [[Systematics]] is the study of the diversification of living forms, the evolutionary history of a group is known as its [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]], and the relationship between the clades can be shown diagrammatically in a [[cladogram]].&lt;ref name="Ruppert"&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although someone who made a scientific study of animals would historically have described themselves as a zoologist, the term has come to refer to those who deal with individual animals, with others describing themselves more specifically as physiologists, ethologists, evolutionary biologists, ecologists, pharmacologists, endocrinologists or parasitologists.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell, P.N.|title=Biology in Profile: A Guide to the Many Branches of Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQTLBAAAQBAJ |year=2013 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4831-3797-1 |pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches of zoology&lt;!-- Link here found at: Animal#top --&gt;==

Although the study of animal life is ancient, its scientific incarnation is relatively modern. This mirrors the transition from [[natural history]] to [[biology]] at the start of the 19th century. Since [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], comparative [[Anatomy|anatomical]] study has been associated with [[Morphogram|morphography]], shaping the modern areas of zoological investigation:  [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[histology]], [[embryology]], [[teratology]] and [[ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/zoology#toc48756|title=zoology|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern zoology first arose in German and British universities. In Britain, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was a prominent figure. His ideas were centered on the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of animals. Many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century. Similar to [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]], his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only.

===Classification===
[[Taxonomy (biology)|Scientific classification in zoology]], is a method by which zoologists group and categorize [[organism]]s by [[Type (biology)|biological type]], such as [[genus]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[nucleic acid sequence]] as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of [[systematics|zoological systematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/systematics-meaning-branches-and-its-application/32374 |title=Systematics: Meaning, Branches and Its Application |date=27 May 2016 |work=Biology Discussion |access-date=12 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|left|Linnaeus's table of the animal kingdom from the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735)]]
Many scientists now consider the [[Kingdom (biology)#Five kingdoms|five-kingdom system]] outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s)&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–4579 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]; [[phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|class]]; [[Order (biology)|order]]; [[Family (biology)|family]]; [[genus]]; [[species]]. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hVUU7Gq8QskC&amp;q=species+epithet+capitalize&amp;pg=PA198 | page = 198 | title = Writing for Science and Engineering: Papers, Presentation | author = Heather Silyn-Roberts | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7506-4636-5 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The classification, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and nomenclature of zoological organisms is administered by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | book-title=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | author=John McNeill | date=4 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertebrate and invertebrate zoology===
[[Vertebrate zoology]] is the [[biology|biological]] [[discipline]] that consists of the study of [[vertebrate]] animals, that is animals with a [[vertebral column|backbone]], such as [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s. The various taxonomically oriented disciplines such as [[mammalogy]], [[biological anthropology]], [[herpetology]], [[ornithology]], and [[ichthyology]] seek to identify and classify [[species]] and study the structures and mechanisms specific to those groups. The rest of the animal kingdom is dealt with by [[invertebrate zoology]], a vast and very diverse group of animals that includes [[sponge]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[worm]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s and many other [[Phylum|phyla]], but [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]] or [[protist]]s are not usually included.&lt;ref name="Ruppert"/&gt;

===Structural zoology===
[[Cell biology]] studies the structural and [[physiology|physiological]] properties of [[cell (biology)|cells]], including their [[behavior]], interactions, and [[natural environment|environment]]. This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels for single-celled organisms such as [[bacteria]] as well as the specialized cells in [[Multicellular organism|multicellular organisms]] such as [[human]]s.  Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.

[[Anatomy]] considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as [[organ (biology)|organs]] and organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry Gray |title=Anatomy of the Human Body |year=1918 |publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and animals, in addition to how they work independently. Anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely related, and can be categorized under "structural" studies. [[Comparative anatomy]] is the study of similarities and differences in the [[anatomy]] of different groups. It is closely related to [[evolutionary biology]] and [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] (the [[evolution]] of species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Gaucher, E.A.; Kratzer, J.T.; Randall, R.N. | title = Deep phylogeny--how a tree can help characterize early life on Earth | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = a002238 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20182607 | pmc = 2827910 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a002238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
[[File:Dog anatomy anterior view.jpg|thumb|upright|Animal anatomical engraving from ''Handbuch der Anatomie der Tiere für Künstler''.]]
Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[Human body#Physiology|human physiology]] to non-human species. Physiology studies how, for example, the [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems function and interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/nst/courses/physiology-of-organisms/what-is-physiology|title=What is physiology? — Faculty of Biology |website=biology.cam.ac.uk |date=16 February 2016 |language=en |access-date=19 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental biology===
[[Developmental biology]] is the study of the processes by which animals and plants reproduce and grow. The discipline includes the study of [[embryonic development]], [[cellular differentiation]], [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] [[reproduction]], [[metamorphosis]], and the growth and differentiation of [[stem cell]]s in the adult organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-developmental/ |title=Developmental biology |date=14 February 2020 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=20 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of both animals and plants is further considered in the articles on [[evolution]], [[population genetics]], [[heredity]], [[genetic variability]], [[Mendelian inheritance]], and [[reproduction]].

===Evolutionary biology===
Evolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes (natural selection, common descent, speciation) that produced the diversity of life on Earth. Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[herpetology]], or [[entomology]], but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Scott F.; Barresi, Michael J.F. (2016) "Developmental Biology" Sinauer Associates, inc.(11th ed.) pp. 785-810. {{ISBN|9781605354705}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jablonski D |title=The future of the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–2116 |year=1999 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |s2cid=43388925 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe761f71c762f11618771d8c2593f9819b1472c0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John H. Gillespie |title=Population Genetics: A Concise Guide |year=1998 |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8008-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary theory. Following the development of [[DNA profiling|DNA fingerprinting]] techniques in the late 20th century, the application of these techniques in zoology has increased the understanding of animal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=Geoffrey K.|last2=Curtis|first2=Caitlin|last3=Millar|first3=Craig D.|last4=Huynen|first4=Leon|last5=Lambert|first5=David M.|date=2014-01-01|title=DNA fingerprinting in zoology: past, present, future|journal=Investigative Genetics|volume=5|issue=1|page=3|doi=10.1186/2041-2223-5-3|issn=2041-2223|pmc=3909909|pmid=24490906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, [[developmental biology]] re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] through the study of [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are [[phylogenetics]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)#Alpha and beta taxonomy|taxonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vassiliki Betty Smocovitis |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03343-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethology===
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate the regurgitating reflex.]]
[[Ethology]] is the [[scientific method|scientific]] and objective study of animal behavior under natural conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Definition of Ethology|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethology|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|access-date=30 October 2012|quote=2 : the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour especially under natural conditions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as opposed to [[behaviorism]], which focuses on behavioral response studies in a laboratory setting.  Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many future ethologists.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc = 1279921 | pmid = 12042386 |date=Jun 2002 | author = Black, J | title = Darwin in the world of emotions | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 311–313 | issn = 0141-0768 | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | url = http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12042386 | format = Free full text | doi = 10.1177/014107680209500617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subfield of ethology is [[behavioral ecology]] which attempts to answer [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions|four questions]] with regard to animal behavior: what are the [[proximate cause]]s of the behavior, the [[ontogeny|developmental history]] of the organism, the [[Adaptation|survival value]] and [[phylogeny]] of the behavior?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacDougall-Shackleton |first=Scott A. |date=2011-07-27 |title=The levels of analysis revisited |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2076–2085 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0363 |pmc=3130367 |pmid=21690126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of study is [[animal cognition]], which uses laboratory experiments and carefully controlled field studies to investigate an animal's intelligence and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors = Shettleworth, S.J. |year=2010 |title=Cognition, Evolution and Behavior |edition=2ND |publisher=Oxford Press | location = New York|citeseerx=10.1.1.843.596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogeography===

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wiley, R. H. |year=1981 |title=Social structure and individual ontogenies: problems of description, mechanism, and evolution |journal= Perspectives in Ethology |volume=4 |pages=105–133 |url=http://www.unc.edu/home/rhwiley/pdfs/IndividualOntogenies.pdf |access-date=21 December 2012 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-7575-7_5 |isbn=978-1-4615-7577-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on topics like [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change]], and [[cladistics]]. It is an integrative field of study, uniting concepts and information from [[evolutionary biology]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]], [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[climatology]].&lt;ref name="Cox_et_al_2016"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biogeography:An Ecological and Evolutionary Approach |last1=Cox |first1=C.

===Molecular biology===

[[Molecular biology]] studies the common [[genetics|genetic]] and developmental mechanisms of animals and plants, attempting to answer the questions regarding the mechanisms of [[Heredity|genetic inheritance]] and the structure of the [[gene]]. In 1953, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] described the structure of DNA and the interactions within the molecule, and this publication jump-started research into molecular biology and increased interest in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last1=Tabery|first1=Monika, James, Piotrowska|title=Molecular Biology|date=2019|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2019/entries/molecular-biology/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-04-19|last2=Darden|first2=Lindley}}&lt;/ref&gt; While researchers practice techniques specific to molecular biology, it is common to combine these with methods from [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. Much of molecular biology is quantitative, and recently a significant amount of work has been done using computer science techniques such as [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. [[Molecular genetics]], the study of gene structure and function, has been among the most prominent sub-fields of molecular biology since the early 2000s. Other branches of biology are informed by molecular biology, by either directly studying the interactions of molecules in their own right such as in [[cell biology]] and [[developmental biology]], or indirectly, where molecular techniques are used to infer historical attributes of [[population]]s or [[species]], as in fields in [[evolutionary biology]] such as [[population genetics]] and [[phylogenetics]]. There is also a long tradition of studying [[biomolecule]]s "from the ground up", or molecularly, in [[biophysics]].&lt;ref name="Tian_2013"&gt;{{cite book| veditors = Tian J |title=Molecular Imaging: Fundamentals and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBXIBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA542|date=2013|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin &amp; Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co.

[[File:Z-value.png|thumb|[[Semi-logarithmic]] graph for the determination of z-value]]{{More footnotes|date=April 2018}}
"F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" is defined as the number of equivalent minutes of steam sterilization at temperature 121.1&amp;nbsp;°C (250 °F) delivered to a container or unit of product calculated using a z-value of 10&amp;nbsp;°C. The term F-value or "F&lt;sub&gt;Tref/z&lt;/sub&gt;" is defined as the equivalent number of minutes to a certain reference temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;) for a certain control microorganism with an established '''Z-value'''.&lt;ref&gt;Stumbo C.R., Thermobacteriology in Food Processing, 1973. {{ISBN|0080886477}}, 9780080886473&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Z-value''' is a term used in microbial [[thermal death time]] calculations.  It is the number of degrees the temperature has to be increased to achieve a tenfold (i.e. 1 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction in the [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]].  The D-value of an organism is the time required in a given medium, at a given temperature, for a ten-fold reduction in the number of organisms.  It is useful when examining the effectiveness of thermal inactivations under different conditions, for example in food cooking and preservation.  The z-value is a measure of the change of the D-value with varying temperature, and is a simplified version of an [[Arrhenius factor|Arrhenius equation]] and it is equivalent to z=2.303 RT T&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;/E.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth S.D, Aseptic Processing and Packaging of Food Products, 1992.  {{ISBN|185166775X}}, 9781851667758&lt;/ref&gt;

The z-value of an [[organism]] in a particular medium is the [[temperature]] change required for the D-value to change by a factor of ten, or put another way, the temperature required for the [[thermal destruction curve]] to move one [[log reduction value|log cycle]]. It is the reciprocal of the slope resulting from the plot of the logarithm of the [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]] versus the temperature at which the D-value was obtained.  While the [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]] gives the time needed at a certain temperature to kill 90% of the organisms, the z-value relates the resistance of an organism to differing temperatures. The z-value allows calculation of the equivalency of two  thermal processes, if the D-value and the z-value are known.

Example: if it takes an increase of 10 °C (18&amp;nbsp;°F) to move the curve one log, then our z-value is 10. Given a [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]] of 4.5 minutes at 150&amp;nbsp;°C, the D-value can be calculated for 160&amp;nbsp;°C by reducing the time by 1 log. The new D-value for 160&amp;nbsp;°C given the z-value is 0.45 minutes. This means that each 10°C (18&amp;nbsp;°F) increase in temperature will reduce our D-value by 1 log. Conversely, a 10 °C (18&amp;nbsp;°F) decrease in temperature will increase our D-value by 1 log. So, the D-value for a temperature of 140&amp;nbsp;°C would be 45 minutes.
